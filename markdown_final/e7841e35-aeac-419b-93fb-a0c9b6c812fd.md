## Question

What are the potential risks of GDM in older age women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in older age women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "older age" is defined in obstetrics and how GDM prevalence changes with age. Then, I should verify the maternal pregnancy-related risks, including hypertensive disorders, cesarean delivery, and stillbirth. Next, I will examine long-term maternal risks such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. After that, I need to assess neonatal and offspring risks, including macrosomia, preterm birth, and intergenerational cardiometabolic effects. Finally, I should consider modifiers like parity, obesity, and screening/treatment effects, and synthesize practical counseling points with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "older age" in pregnancy and its association with GDM. Advanced maternal age is generally defined as 35 years or older, with very advanced maternal age as 45 years or older; risk rises progressively across age strata, and older maternal age is a well-established risk factor for GDM, with prevalence increasing from about 3% in the general obstetric population to 7–12% after age 40 and up to 20% after age 50, reflecting age-related insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction [^1156S59X] [^111p372C] [^114fXNH9].

> I will now examine maternal pregnancy-related risks. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of hypertensive disease risk. Multiple high-credibility sources indicate that women aged 35 or older have a 30% higher risk of preeclampsia at ages 40–44 and more than a doubling of risk at ages 45–59, and this risk remains elevated even after adjusting for chronic hypertension and diabetes; GDM itself further increases preeclampsia risk, compounding the effect in older mothers [^116Ne44g] [^115iNZ62]. I should also confirm cesarean delivery risk; older maternal age independently increases cesarean rates, and in women with GDM, treatment reduces macrosomia but does not consistently reduce cesarean rates, so the age-related surgical risk remains clinically relevant [^1156S59X] [^113S4HDN]. Hold on, I should verify stillbirth risk; GDM is associated with a small but meaningful increase in stillbirth after 36 weeks, with an estimated relative risk around 1.34, which is particularly salient in older patients who already have higher baseline stillbirth risk [^112iffK8] [^114FHnkM].

> Next, I should review long-term maternal risks. I need to ensure I cite the strongest evidence for progression to type 2 diabetes. Multiple meta-analyses show women with prior GDM have approximately a 7–10-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those with normoglycemic pregnancies, with cumulative incidence rising over time and remaining elevated for decades; this risk is amplified with multiple GDM pregnancies and persists beyond 35 years of follow-up in some cohorts [^116oXHaT] [^114t3V4q] [^112dWhN8]. Let me consider cardiovascular disease next; women with a history of GDM have about a 2-fold higher risk of cardiovascular disease, and when GDM coexists with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, predicted 10–30 year ASCVD risk is substantially higher, reinforcing the need for lifelong cardiometabolic surveillance [^1151nL3r]. I should double-check mortality data; a large 30-year cohort found a 25% higher all-cause mortality in women with a history of GDM, with a 59% higher cardiovascular mortality, independent of subsequent type 2 diabetes, underscoring GDM as a sentinel risk marker [^114e65RR].

> Now, I will assess neonatal and offspring risks. Macrosomia and large-for-gestational-age infants are more common with GDM, increasing risks of shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia; treatment of GDM reduces macrosomia and some neonatal complications, but the baseline risk remains higher in older mothers with GDM [^115iNZ62] [^113S4HDN]. Preterm birth risk is also increased in GDM, and in very advanced maternal age cohorts, preterm delivery rates are higher, which compounds neonatal morbidity and NICU utilization [^116RSr4V] [^112wmoZS]. Hold on, I should verify long-term offspring risks; exposure to maternal GDM is associated with increased risks of childhood obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and early-onset cardiovascular disease, with durable effects into adolescence and beyond, supporting the concept of intergenerational cardiometabolic programming [^112vdUrT] [^116ApnRD].

> But wait, what if parity modifies these risks. Let me reconsider the role of parity and age. Multiparity can confer a modest protective effect against GDM in younger women, but this benefit attenuates with advancing maternal age, likely due to accumulated metabolic dysfunction and declining insulin sensitivity, so older multiparous women still face elevated GDM risk and its complications [^116NGJWw]. I should also confirm recurrence risk; GDM recurrence is high, around 50–70% in many cohorts, and older age at subsequent pregnancy further increases recurrence, reinforcing the need for early screening and risk mitigation in interpregnancy care [^117KSmUT] [^112taNaq].

> Next, I should review screening and treatment considerations that mitigate risk. I need to check guideline-backed recommendations. Universal screening at 24–28 weeks is standard, with consideration of earlier screening in high-risk older adults; treatment with nutrition and exercise, and insulin when needed, reduces macrosomia, preeclampsia, and some neonatal complications, though it does not eliminate all age-related risks such as cesarean delivery [^115iNZ62] [^114VtUYX]. Postpartum, a 75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks and lifelong screening every 1–3 years are recommended to detect progression to type 2 diabetes, and lifestyle intervention or metformin can prevent or delay diabetes in high-risk women, including those with prior GDM and obesity [^11485EeF] [^113siMDX].

> Let me synthesize the risk profile succinctly. In older pregnant women, GDM confers additive risks on top of age-related vulnerabilities: higher risks of preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders, cesarean delivery, and stillbirth during pregnancy; a markedly increased and persistent risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and higher long-term mortality after pregnancy; and increased risks of macrosomia, preterm birth, and long-term cardiometabolic disease in offspring. These risks scale with age, particularly beyond 40–45 years, and are further amplified by obesity, multiple GDM pregnancies, and coexisting hypertensive disorders [^1156S59X] [^116oXHaT] [^114e65RR] [^112vdUrT].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical counseling. I need to ensure the message is clear and actionable. Preconception and early pregnancy counseling should emphasize optimizing weight, blood pressure, and glucose, early GDM screening in older adults, aggressive glycemic management when GDM is diagnosed, and structured postpartum follow-up with diabetes prevention strategies; breastfeeding should be encouraged given its association with lower maternal type 2 diabetes risk, and families should be engaged in early childhood obesity prevention given intergenerational risks [^11485EeF] [^113siMDX] [^113ivGru] [^112vdUrT].

Older women with GDM face **higher risks of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage** [^114FoqpF] [^112wmoZS], with a **sevenfold increase in type 2 diabetes** [^116oXHaT] and persistent cardiovascular risk [^1151nL3r] [^114e65RR]. Their infants have higher risks of macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, preterm birth, and neonatal hypoglycemia [^115iNZ62] [^116RSr4V], with long-term risks of obesity and metabolic disorders [^112vdUrT] [^116ApnRD]. Risk rises with age, especially after 40, and is amplified by obesity and prior GDM [^1156S59X] [^117KSmUT]. Early screening, strict glycemic control, and postpartum follow-up are essential to mitigate these risks [^11485EeF] [^114VtUYX].

## Maternal risks

### Pregnancy-related complications

- **Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension**: Older women with GDM have a significantly increased risk of hypertensive disorders, including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension [^116Ne44g] [^115iNZ62].

- **Cesarean delivery**: Advanced maternal age combined with GDM markedly increases the likelihood of cesarean delivery due to macrosomia and labor complications [^114FoqpF] [^112wmoZS].

- **Postpartum hemorrhage**: Older women with GDM are at higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage, likely related to uterine atony and macrosomia [^112wmoZS].

---

### Long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risks

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)**: Women with GDM have a sevenfold increased risk of developing T2DM later in life, with the risk escalating with advancing maternal age [^116oXHaT] [^114t3V4q].

- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**: GDM in older women is associated with a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease [^1151nL3r] [^115HdjR7].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Older women with GDM are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^115fumvZ] [^115YnKjq].

---

## Fetal and neonatal risks

### Immediate neonatal complications

- **Macrosomia**: Older women with GDM have a higher risk of delivering macrosomic infants (> 4,000 g), increasing the risk of shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia [^115iNZ62] [^114VtUYX].

- **Preterm birth**: GDM in older women is associated with increased rates of spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth, contributing to neonatal morbidity [^116RSr4V] [^112wmoZS].

- **Neonatal hypoglycemia**: Infants of older mothers with GDM are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia due to fetal hyperinsulinemia [^115iNZ62] [^116jEbsQ].

---

### Long-term offspring risks

Offspring of older mothers with GDM have a higher risk of **childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome**, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia [^112vdUrT] [^116ApnRD]. They also face an increased risk of **type 2 diabetes** and cardiovascular disease later in life, reflecting the intergenerational impact of maternal hyperglycemia [^112vdUrT] [^115HdjR7].

---

## Factors influencing risk severity

Several factors influence the **severity of risks** associated with GDM in older women:

| **Factor** | **Influence on risk severity** |
|-|-|
| Maternal age | Risk increases progressively with advancing age, particularly after 40 years [^1156S59X] [^114Vqhrt] |
| Obesity | Exacerbates insulin resistance, increasing maternal and fetal complications [^115YnKjq] [^114F3gBN] |
| Parity | Multiparity may modestly increase GDM risk, but age-related factors predominate [^116NGJWw] [^113fivQt] |
| Ethnicity | Certain ethnic groups (e.g. Asian, Hispanic) have higher baseline GDM risk, compounding age-related risks [^112tS5K7] [^115YnKjq] |
| Previous GDM | Strongly predicts recurrence and amplifies future metabolic risks [^117KSmUT] [^112dWhN8] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the elevated risks, **clinical management should include**:

- **Early screening**: Universal screening for GDM is recommended, with consideration of earlier screening in older women with additional risk factors [^115iNZ62] [^114FHnkM].

- **Strict glycemic control**: Aggressive management of maternal hyperglycemia through diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy (insulin preferred) is essential to reduce maternal and fetal complications [^114VtUYX] [^115MXxwa].

- **Postpartum follow-up**: Lifelong screening for T2DM and cardiovascular risk factors is recommended, with lifestyle interventions to prevent progression [^11485EeF] [^113siMDX].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinated care involving obstetricians, endocrinologists, dietitians, and pediatricians is crucial for optimal outcomes [^notfound].

---

Older women with GDM face **significant maternal and fetal risks**, including increased rates of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage, as well as long-term risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Their infants are at higher risk of macrosomia, preterm birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and long-term metabolic disorders. These risks are amplified by advancing maternal age, obesity, and previous GDM, necessitating early screening, strict glycemic control, and comprehensive postpartum follow-up.

### Different intensities of glycaemic control for women with gestational diabetes mellitus [^113eCHWN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has major short- and long-term implications for both the mother and her baby. GDM is defined as a carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia or any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy from 24 weeks' gestation onwards and which resolves following the birth of the baby. Rates for GDM can be as high as 25% depending on the population and diagnostic criteria used and rates are increasing globally. Risk factors associated with GDM include advanced maternal age, obesity, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and a previous history of GDM, macrosomia or unexplained stillbirth. There is wide variation internationally in glycaemic treatment target recommendations for women with GDM that are based on consensus rather than high-quality trials.

Objectives

To assess the effect of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 February 2016) and reference lists of the retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included one randomised controlled trial. Cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for carrying out data collection, assessing study quality and analysing results. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality and extracted data for the one included study. We sought additional information from one trial author but had no response. We assessed the quality of evidence for selected outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included one Canadian trial of 180 women, recruited between 20 to 32 weeks' gestation, who had been diagnosed with GDM. Data from 171 of the 180 women were published as a conference abstract and no full report has been identified. The overall risk of bias of the single included study was judged to be unclear. The included trial did not report on any of this review's primary outcomes. For the mother, these were hypertension disorders of pregnancy or subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. For the infant, our primary outcomes were (perinatal (fetal and neonatal) mortality; large-for-gestational age; composite of death or severe morbidity or later childhood neurosensory disability). The trial did report data relating to some of this review's secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference in caesarean section rates for women assigned to using strict glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/L) and at one-hour postprandial 6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL)) (28/85, 33%) when compared with women assigned to using liberal glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.8 mmol/L (103 mg/dL) and at one-hour postprandial 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)) (21/86, 24%) (risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 2.18, one trial, 171 women; very low quality). Using the GRADE approach, we found the quality of the evidence to bevery low for caesarean section due to poor reporting of risk of bias, imprecision and publication bias. Strict glycaemic targets were associated with an increase in the use of pharmacological therapy (identified as the use of insulin in this study) (33/85; 39%) compared with liberal glycaemic targets (18/86; 21%) (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.03; one trial, 171 women). CIs are wide suggesting imprecision and caution is required when interpreting the data. No other secondary maternal outcome data relevant to this review were reported. For the infant, there were no clear differences between the groups of women receiving strict and liberal glycaemic targets for macrosomia (birthweight greater than 4000 g) (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.85, one trial, 171 babies); small-for-gestational age (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.63, one trial, 171 babies); birthweight (mean difference (MD) -92.00 g, 95% CI -241.97 to 57.97, one trial, 171 babies) or gestational age (MD -0.30 weeks, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.13, one trial, 171 babies). Adverse effects data were not reported. No other secondary neonatal outcomes relevant to this review were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This review is based on a single study (involving 180 women) with an unclear risk of bias. The trial (which was only reported in a conference abstract) did not provide data for any of this review's primary outcomes but did provide data for a limited number of our secondary outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice for targets for glycaemic control for women with GDM to minimise adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Glycaemic target recommendations from international professional organisations for maternal glycaemic control vary widely and are reliant on consensus given the lack of high-quality evidence. Further high-quality trials are needed, and these should compare different glycaemic targets for guiding treatment of women with GDM, assess both short-term and long-term health outcomes for women and their babies, include women's experiences and assess health services costs. Four studies are ongoing.

### Adherence to healthy lifestyle and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: prospective cohort study [^115JJZdC]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes, defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition in pregnancy, is one of the most common complications in pregnancy. In the United States, gestational diabetes affects 1.1–25.5% of pregnancies depending on the criteria used. It represents a growing health concern; multiple population based studies have shown increases in the occurrence of gestational diabetes in the past decade. It is linked to short term and long term adverse health outcomes in women and their offspring. For instance, women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia during pregnancyand an exceptionally high risk for type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. High glucose concentrations in pregnancy have long been regarded as a teratogen, affecting fetal structure, function, and development, and as having long term adverse impacts on the offspring. Children born after a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes are more likely to be born macrosomic and to have birth defects. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that they are also at higher risk of developing childhood obesityand glucose intolerance in early adulthood, although findings have been inconsistent, and females are more likely to develop gestational diabetes themselves, leading to a trans-generational cycle of diabetes-begets-diabetes. Prevention of gestational diabetes could be an important strategy in curbing the obesity and diabetes epidemic in this and future generations. Therefore, it is pivotal to identify potentially modifiable risk factors and to quantify their potential impact on this common condition.

Several potentially modifiable factors before pregnancy have been related to a lower risk of gestational diabetes. These include maintaining a healthy body weight, adapting a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and abstinence from cigarette smoking. We examined the joint effect of lifestyle characteristics on risk of gestational diabetes. We hypothesized that these factors are jointly associated with a substantially lower risk of gestational diabetes independent of other major risk factors such as advanced maternal age, greater parity, and family history of diabetes.

### Association between very advanced maternal age women with gestational diabetes mellitus and the risks of adverse infant outcomes: a cohort study from the NVSS 2014–2019 [^116RSr4V]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to socio-economic development and advances in assisted reproductive technology (ART), the trend of more frequent births among older women, particularly those of very advanced maternal age (≥ 45 years) (vAMA), is likely to continue. A considerable amount of studies have reported that rising maternal age is one of the key drivers for the increased prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM is traditionally defined as carbohydrate intolerance leading to hyperglycemia of varying severity with onset or first detection during pregnancy. AMA has been identified as a risk factor for GDM. Women of vAMA have a higher incidence of GDM than those under 45 years. Besides, the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes for women aged ≥ 40 years increase with age, and a prior review shows that vAMA women have elevated risks of adverse perinatal outcomes. Extensive research has shown that GDM is associated with increased risks of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, growth abnormalities, and respiratory distress. Thus, vAMA women who plan to become pregnant may need to pay attention to the risks of GDM and adverse outcomes. Healthcare givers can counsel women of vAMA, especially those with GDM.

Preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) is a common adverse infant outcome, resulting in approximately 1 million infant deaths each year. Even if premature infants survive, they are accompanied by long-lasting diseases that contribute to a global health burden. It has previously been observed that diabetes is a significant risk factor for spontaneous and indicated preterm delivery. Diboun et al. indicated that GDM may be used as a novel predictor of preterm delivery. In the study of Billionnet et al. the risk of preterm birth was illustrated to be higher in the GDM group than in the no diabetes group. Regarding other infant outcomes, Venkatesh et al. reported that from 2014 through 2020, the frequency of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission increased, while no significant change was shown in small for gestational age for American women with GDM aged 15–44 years. Although many studies delved into the relationship between GDM and preterm birth, the association of GDM with preterm birth for women of vAMA awaits exploration, which may help identify the population with a high risk of preterm birth and devise prevention and intervention strategies to improve outcomes in vAMA women. The relationships between GDM and NICU admission, low birthweight and small for gestational age are also under-researched.

### Effective interventions in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tHeZ2]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycemia, usually detected by screening in the late second or early third trimester of pregnancy. In 2021, the International Diabetes Federation indicated that the global prevalence of GDM was 14%. GDM poses several maternal health complications, including an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, caesarean delivery, and labor induction. Offspring exposed to GDM in utero are more likely to be large-for-gestational-age – and to develop impaired glucose metabolism and youth-onset type 2 diabetes. Women with GDM have a risk of recurrent GDM in subsequent pregnanciesand have an extremely elevated lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Although the etiology of GDM is idiopathic and multifactorial, it is presumed to be attributable to non-modifiable risk factors such as a previous history of GDM, advanced maternal age (> 35 years), and family history of diabetes, and modifiable factors such as higher body weight, metabolic syndrome, and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, including poor diet and lack of physical activity.

### Recurrent gestational diabetes: risk factors, diagnosis, management, and implications [^117B4kej]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should be regarded as a sentinel event in a woman's life that presents challenges and disease prevention opportunities to all providers of health care for women of reproductive age. Prediabetic risk factors are rising in prevalence and include dietary and lifestyle habits, which when superimposed on genetic predisposition contribute to the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes and GDM. There is growing evidence that treatment of GDM matters, with a continuum of adverse pregnancy outcome risks proportional to degrees of maternal glucose intolerance. GDM in an index pregnancy increases the risk of recurrent GDM in subsequent pregnancies, and recurrence rates of up to 70% have been reported. GDM recurrence rates are influenced by maternal health characteristics and past pregnancy history. The risk of later metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes is increased in women with a history of GDM and women should be screened for postpartum glucose intolerance. Opportunities to prevent recurrent GDM and later type 2 diabetes require attention to risk factors and plasma glucose status with identification of impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.

### Maternal metabolic factors and the association with gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115YnKjq]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as the onset or first recognition of glucose intolerance during pregnancy, primarily in the second or third trimester.GDM is one of the most common metabolic complications in pregnancy, affecting 5%–25% of all pregnant women worldwide, depending on screening approaches and diagnostic criteria.GDM has adverse maternal health consequences, including an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm delivery, medicalised delivery, as well as an increased risk for developing type 2 DM and cardiovascular events in the first decade following pregnancy. Offspring of mothers with GDM are at greater risk for large for gestational age, respiratory distress syndromeand neonatal hypoglycaemia, and tend to develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages.

Recognised risk factors for GDM include maternal obesity, advanced maternal age, excess gestational weight gain, Asian and African ethnicity, and a history of diabetes. Fasting or postprandial blood glucose may be assessed early, but whether it is a suitable screening test for GDM has not been clarified.

Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors that includes atherogenic dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure, insulin resistance, and obesity, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)and diabetes by up to 5‐fold. In two pregnancy cohorts, Grieger et al.and Schneider et al.showed that MetS, measured in early pregnancy, increased the risk for GDM by 2–4 fold, even after adjusting for body mass index (BMI). Several studies have demonstrated that individual metabolic markers such as raised triglycerides (TG) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) pose a significant risk for developing GDM. The relationship between MetS or its individual components as a risk factor for GDM is plausible given their shared relationship to future risk of CVD. Importantly, metabolic factors can be modified by diet, lifestyle, and pharmacological agents. Consideration of assessing metabolic markers in early antenatal care may provide information about potential future risk for GDM, allowing for early detection and management.

### Clinical outcomes in high-risk pregnancies due to advanced maternal age [^111p372C]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Preexisting Comorbidities and Impact on Pregnancy Outcomes

For women living with a chronic illness, pregnancy may be experienced as a time of additional risk that demands increased monitoring or surveillance. The management of pregnant women of AMA requires understanding the interplay between age and preexisting comorbidities. The aging process alone contributes to some obstetric complications, and other complications largely relate to additional coexisting factors or conditions (e.g. multiple gestation, higher parity, chronic diseases). With aging, the prevalence of coexisting conditions (e.g. surgical illnesses, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular, renal, and autoimmune diseases) increases considerably, putting pregnant women age ≥ 35 years at high risk of experiencing two- to three-fold higher rates of hospitalization, cesarean delivery, and other pregnancy-related complications.

Primiparas of AMA are more likely to be single, have chronic conditions, and have higher rates of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia. Multiple pregnancies hold additional risk and may reduce the effect of age. In multivariable analysis, being of age ≥ 45 was an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia.

Preexisting and pregnancy-related hypertension are the most common complicating conditions, particularly because of their high prevalence in older women and in those who are overweight. The chances of being diagnosed with chronic hypertension are two- to four-fold higher in women age ≥ 35 years (vs. 30–34 years). Hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPDs) — including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, chronic hypertension, and preeclampsia or eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension — are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality that affect ∼12% of all pregnancies.

Preexisting diabetes and gestational diabetes increase three- to six-fold in women age ≥ 40 years (vs. 20–29 years). Preexisting diabetes is associated with increased risks of congenital anomalies and perinatal mortality and morbidity. The incidence of gestational diabetes in the general obstetric population is 3%, increasing to 7%–12% in women age > 40 years and to 20% in those age > 50 years. A major complication of gestational diabetes is macrosomia.

### Impact of parity on gestational diabetes mellitus in Chinese women: a retrospective cohort study [^116DRQpb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) generally refers to any level of glucose intolerance initially detected in pregnancy. It impacts approximately 14% of pregnancies worldwide, with a striking epidemiological escalation observed in China: prevalence rates surged from 4% in 2010 to 21% in 2020. This upward trajectory parallels rising obesity rates and a demographic shift toward advanced maternal age, partly driven by the three-child policy. Beyond its public health burden, GDM confers substantial morbidity risks, including preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, macrosomia, and longitudinal susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in both mothers and offspring. Consequently, elucidating modifiable determinants of GDM risk is critical for developing evidence-based prevention strategies and improving maternal-fetal outcomes.

Parity is an important obstetric determinant influencing pregnancy outcomes. Evidence from a study in Israel demonstrates that nulliparae exhibit heightened susceptibility to common pregnancy complications compared to multiparae. GDM, recognized as one of the most common pregnancy complications, has been linked to parity in prior research; however, the results have been inconsistent. Several investigations have proposed that higher parity might correlate with reduced GDM risk, potentially mediated through physiological adaptations such as changes in insulin resistance and hormonal levels. Conversely, alternative studies have reported either no significant link between parity and GDM, or have even suggested that higher parity may increase GDM risk. These discrepancies underscore the imperative for large-scale, methodologically robust investigations to elucidate parity's role in GDM development.

Maternal age and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) constitute established independent risk factors for GDM. Advanced maternal age is associated with an elevated GDM risk, a relationship potentially mediated through age-related metabolic dysregulation characterized by reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired pancreatic β-cell functionality. Similarly, elevated pre-pregnancy BMI represents a robust predictor of GDM incidence, likely attributable to adipose tissue-driven exacerbation of gestational insulin resistance and subsequent hyperglycemic states. Concurrently, secular trends in socioeconomic development and enhanced female educational attainment may modulate GDM susceptibility by altering dietary patterns and physical activity during gestation. Despite these well-characterized associations, the independent contribution of parity to GDM risk remains unclear, necessitating rigorous evaluation of potential confounding factors and interactions with other variables.

Accordingly, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study utilizing clinical data from Chinese women. Our objectives were to investigate the independent association between parity and GDM after adjustment for key confounders, and to assess potential moderating effect by maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI in parity-GDM relationships.

### Future risk of diabetes in mother and child after gestational diabetes mellitus [^115aD8wg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity. However, significant long-term morbidity also exists for the mother and offspring. Women with previous GDM have a very high risk of developing overt diabetes, primarily type 2 diabetes, later in life. Moreover, the risk of the metabolic syndrome is increased 3-fold in these women. Their offspring have an 8-fold risk of diabetes/prediabetes at 19–27 years of age. Thus, GDM is part of a vicious circle which increases the development of diabetes in the coming generations.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked with several acute maternal health risks and long-term development of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Intrauterine exposure to GDM similarly increases offspring risk of early-life health complications and later disease. GDM recurrence is common, affecting 40 to 73% of women, and augments associated maternal/fetal/child health risks. Modifiable and independent risk factors for GDM include maternal excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy overweight and obesity. Lifestyle interventions that target diet, activity, and behavioral strategies can effectively modify body weight. Randomized clinical trials testing the effects of lifestyle interventions during pregnancy to reduce excessive gestational weight gain have generally shown mixed effects on reducing GDM incidence. Trials testing the effects of postpartum lifestyle interventions among women with a history of GDM have shown reduced incidence of diabetes and improved cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the long-term effects of interpregnancy or prepregnancy lifestyle interventions on subsequent GDM remain unknown. Future adequately powered and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the effects of lifestyle interventions to prevent GDM and identify pathways to effectively reach reproductive-aged women across all levels of society, before, during, and after pregnancy.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus after gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oXHaT]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk and time of onset have not been fully quantified. We therefore did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of association between these conditions and the effect of factors that might modify the risk.

Methods

We identified cohort studies in which women who had developed type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes were followed up between Jan 1, 1960, and Jan 31, 2009, from Embase and Medline. 205 relevant reports were hand searched. We selected 20 studies that included 675 455 women and 10 859 type 2 diabetic events. We calculated and pooled unadjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for each study using a random-effects model. Subgroups analysed were the number of cases of type 2 diabetes, ethnic origin, duration of follow-up, maternal age, body-mass index, and diagnostic criteria.

Findings

Women with gestational diabetes had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy (RR 7.43, 95% CI 4.79–11.51). Although the largest study (659 164 women; 9502 cases of type 2 diabetes) had the largest RR (12.6, 95% CI 12.15–13.19), RRs were generally consistent among the subgroups assessed.

Interpretation

Increased awareness of the magnitude and timing of the risk of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes among patients and clinicians could provide an opportunity to test and use dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions that might prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in affected women.

### Understanding gestational diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study of awareness and prevention strategies among pregnant women at risk in jimma town, Ethiopia [^1127LXRN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Background information on the study participants

A total of seven different pregnant women participated in the in-depth interviews. The demographic data revealed that the mean age of the reproductive-age group of women was 33.4 years (range: 18–35). The majority of the women have no formal education and are multiparous in terms of parity. Study participants were identified on the basis of their risk of GDM. All respondents reported one or more risk factors for GDM. While family history of type 2 diabetes was frequently cited, some participants also reported multiple risk factors including obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes and advanced maternal age (age > 35). None of them experienced obstetric complications during the time of data collection (Table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of Socio-demographic characteristics and GDM risks of participants

The transcripts were examined via thematic analysis, resulting in three main themes: understanding gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), lifestyle change and the effect of GDM on both mothers and infants.

Understanding the GDM

GDM occurs exclusively during pregnancy. One of these findings suggests that age or family history might also play a role and that GDM typically resolves after childbirth, although there is an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) indicates potential health risks for both the mother and the infant. Women diagnosed with GDM are particularly susceptible to experiencing it again in future pregnancies. Thus, a GDM diagnosis can serve as an important warning sign of the likelihood of future type 2 diabetes and is considered an "excellent marker" for implementing targeted preventive measures during and after pregnancy.

In the first theme the study participants were asked, "What they know about GDM, how they believe the GDM affects pregnancy".

Most participants did not recognize gestational diabetes mellitus, but they mentioned that they knew about diabetes mellitus. One of the 36-year-old study participants reported GDM and its prevention:

It might be related to having severe nausea and headaches. I think it is something related to a lot of urine, but I am not sure about it. I have heard about diabetes, but not gestational diabetes.

We also asked for prevention measures that should be taken by the mothers at risk.

A 25-year-old participant replied, " Is it the same with diabetes? I have no idea about gestational diabetes mellitus. I guess having regular ante natal care follow-up may help the mother; otherwise, the one who protects from disease is only Allah/God. Lifestyle change is something luxury for us".

### Independent and joint associations of age, pre-pregnancy BMI, and gestational weight gain with adverse pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus [^114F3gBN]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, advanced-age pregnancy can increase the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes. To improve the prognosis of mothers and children, we should advocate for age-appropriate pregnancy and provide comprehensive maternity care services for women with advanced-age pregnancy. The key modifiable risk factors for pregnant women are their pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. Strict weight management during pregnancy to prevent excessive GWG in pregnant women with GDM may have a positive effect on improving neonatal outcomes and the long-term health of these people in adulthood.

### Investigating factors affecting the quality of life of women with gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EAekc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition characterized by any level of glucose intolerance that is first detected during pregnancy, commonly diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation during the second trimester. It is considered one of the fastest-growing types of diabetes, largely driven by rising rates of obesity and older maternal age globally. According to the most recent statistics from the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 1 in 6 live births worldwide in 2021 were affected by hyperglycemia during pregnancy, with GDM accounting for 80.3% of these cases.

GDM presents significant risks and potential complications for both expectant mothers and their babies. For mothers, there is an increased likelihood of experiencing complications such as preeclampsia, hypertension, excessive amniotic fluid, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean delivery, and mental health challenges like depression. Over the long term, women with GDM face a sevenfold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, their risk for conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cancer, kidney disease, and eye disorders is elevated. Furthermore, when these women become pregnant again, the recurrence of GDM is seen in 33–69% of cases. For babies born to mothers with GDM, there is a heightened risk of being large for gestational age, experiencing intrauterine growth restriction, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, often requiring a longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. In the long term, these infants also face an increased risk of poor health outcomes, including cognitive developmental delays, difficulty maintaining a healthy weight, and a higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and mental health disorders. As a result, the condition affects not only the physical well-being of women but also has a profound impact on their emotional and psychological health, which ultimately influences their overall quality of life (QoL).

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement for screening before 24 weeks of gestation note that between 2006 and 2016 there was an absolute increase of 3.6% in the prevalence of gestational diabetes, pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy, and those diagnosed before 24 weeks may be at an even greater risk; potential harms of screening include psychological harms, intensive medical interventions, and negative hospital experiences, and possible adverse effects of treatment include neonatal or maternal hypoglycemia, increased risk of small for gestational age infants, and maternal stress.

### Modifiable risk factors and long term risk of type 2 diabetes among individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus: prospective cohort study [^111CZz89]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Women (or people who menstruate) who have developed gestational diabetes mellitus represent one such high risk population of type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes mellitus is a pregnancy complication affecting about 8% of pregnancies in the US. Prevalence of the disorder is rising, potentially due to a combination of growing obesity and increasing maternal age. Compared with the general population, women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus face up to a 10-fold higher risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes mellitus unmasks underlying cardiometabolic dysregulation or susceptibility at an early age, offering an opportunity for early intervention to prevent subsequent progression to type 2 diabetes. While several individual diet and lifestyle factors have been related to risk of type 2 diabetes among these high risk women, the combined associations of modifiable risk factors on long term risk of the disorder are less well understood. Additionally, whether adherence to optimal levels of modifiable factors would reduce risk of the disorder even among those who are overweight/obese or have a greater genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated; this association is critical, because the prevalence of being overweight/obesity and genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes are higher in women with gestational diabetes mellitus than in the general population. To fill in these research gaps, we prospectively evaluated the associations of adherence to optimal levels of five modifiable risk factors, including healthy body mass index, high quality diet, regular physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption, and not smoking, with the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes among women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus from the longitudinal Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) with 28 years of follow-up. We also assessed whether these associations were modified by obesity status or underlying genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes.

### The risk of stillbirth and infant death stratified by gestational age in women with gestational diabetes [^112iffK8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetes mellitus in pregnancy:

- **Definition**: Diabetes during pregnancy is characterized by newly recognized hyperglycemia during pregnancy associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidities.
- **Pathophysiology**: Diabetes during pregnancy is caused due to insulin resistance (due to maternal obesity or increased production of diabetogenic placental hormone) in pregnancy and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.
- **Disease course**: Diabetes during pregnancy is related to several maternal complications including diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, retinopathy, deterioration of nephropathy, gastric neuropathy, miscarriages, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, premature delivery; and perinatal complications including stillbirth, neonatal death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, nerve palsy, neonatal hypoglycemia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: There is an increased risk of stillbirth from 36–42 weeks in women with diabetes during pregnancy with a relative risk of 1.34 (95% CI 1.2–1.5) and 17.1 per 10,000 deliveries.

### A clinical update on gestational diabetes mellitus [^1148iLL3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.

Methods

Study design and population

This was a cohort study. All data of pregnant women aged 45 or older who were tested for GDM and did not have pre-gestational diabetes were extracted from the NVSS 2014–2019. The NVSS database provides data on births and deaths as well as maternal characteristics in 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia, and 5 territories (Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands) of the United States. Participants were excluded according to the following criteria: (1) women with infections presenting or treated during this pregnancy; (2) women with missing information on gestational weeks, neonatal weight, and NICU admission records.

### Persistence of risk for type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes mellitus [^112dWhN8]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gestational diabetes mellitus complicates ∼6% of pregnancies and strongly predicts subsequent type 2 diabetes. It has not been fully elucidated how risk depends on the number of affected pregnancies or how long the excess risk persists.

Research Design and Methods

We assessed reproductive histories in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes using a nationwide cohort of 50,884 women. Among participants who initially did not have diabetes, 3,370 were diagnosed with diabetes during 10 years of follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards models that allowed risk to depend on age, cumulative number of pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus, and time since the most recent affected pregnancy, adjusting for BMI, educational level, and race/ethnicity.

Results

History of one or more pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus predicted elevated age-specific risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio of 3.87 (95% CI 2.60–5.75) 6–15 years after an affected pregnancy. Risk increased steeply with multiple affected pregnancies. The age-specific associations attenuated over time after an affected pregnancy, with an estimated 24% reduction of the hazard ratio per decade. Risk remained elevated, however, for > 35 years.

Conclusions

Gestational diabetes mellitus predicted markedly increased rates of type 2 diabetes. Relative risk increased substantially with each additional affected pregnancy. The estimated hazard ratio declined with time after a pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus but remained elevated for > 35 years. Women recalling a history of gestational diabetes mellitus should be screened regularly for type 2 diabetes, even late in life.

### Potential protective effect of lactation against incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116KStmB]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

At present about 415 million adults suffer from diabetes, of which about 90% are type 2 diabetes mellitus. 1 Diabetes is associated with life‐threatening morbidity, making the disease not only personal but also socioeconomic problem. In 2015, about 5 million people died because of diabetes. 1

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as "diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes". 2 The GDM occurs in nearly 14% of live births. 1 Although hyperglycemia usually normalizes immediately after delivery, the risk of lifetime type 2 diabetes mellitus in women who had GDM is more than 7‐fold higher compared with in women with normoglycaemic pregnancies. 3 Furthermore, up to 50% of women who had GDM developed type 2 diabetes mellitus within 5 years postpartum. 4 Therefore, women with GDM are recognized to be at high risk of developing diabetes at younger ages and are therefore the target of preventive measures.

Intensive lifestyle modification is effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous GDM. 5 However, postpartum women may face difficulties in adopting a healthy lifestyle mainly because of a lack of time. 6, 7

Meanwhile, lactation is increasingly being recognized for its potential benefits on maternal glycemic metabolism. Childbearing itself is suggested to put women at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared with nulliparous women, 8, 9 and breastfeeding may "reset" the burden 10 and lower the risk of diabetes in dose‐response manner. 11, 12 Although etiological evidence is yet to be established, several hypotheses for this beneficial effect have been proposed such as extra energy expenditure for milk production, 13 visceral fat mobilization, 10 and pancreatic beta‐cell rescue by prolactin 14 and/or oxytocin. 15

It is of great interest whether women with previous GDM, the high risk population for type 2 diabetes mellitus, benefit as well from breastfeeding practice. To date, several observational studies investigating the association between lactation and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence after GDM pregnancy have been conducted with mixed results. Although there are several reviews written on this topic, 16, 17 none was conducted systematically. Only few GDM guidelines recommend breastfeeding for maternal health with minimal evidence. 18, 19, 20 To cover all the available evidence and to synthesize the data if available, we aimed to systematically review current findings on lactation for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention in women with previous GDM.

### Socioeconomic status, maternal risk factors, and gestational diabetes mellitus across reproductive years: a Finnish register-based study [^116AAXQh]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become a challenge in maternity care. According to the International Diabetes Federation, an estimated 16.7% (21.1 million) of live births in 2021 were affected by some form of hyperglycemia, 80.3% of which were due to GDM. Studies indicated a consistent relationship between the socioeconomic status of women and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in high-income countries, whether measured by educational level, income, or occupation. However, the mechanisms through which poor socioeconomic status and maternal risk factors contribute to the higher incidence of GDM have not been adequately investigated. There is evidence that GDM incidence increases along with the increase in living standards. At the same time, studies show that GDM incidence is inversely associated with socioeconomic status within the population; women with high socioeconomic status have a lower risk of GDM than women with low socioeconomic status. In other studies, GDM did not differ across socioeconomic groups once confounding factors were fully taken into account.

The apparent discrepancy between the standard of living and the incidence of GDM at the ecosystem level and within the population can be explained by several mechanisms. Epidemiological transitions and changes in screening policies for GDM could be relevant. Furthermore, the relationship between maternal risk factors and GDM potentially may differ by socioeconomic status within the population. For instance, Geronimus and colleagues raised the possibility that advanced maternal age could be more harmful among women of lower socioeconomic status for adverse pregnancy outcomes. A similar mechanism could explain socioeconomic differences in GDM.

Understanding the socioeconomic paradox of GDM has public health importance. Therefore, we assessed the extent to which socioeconomic differences in GDM are accounted for by differences in maternal risk factors, to determine whether age-related risks of GDM differ across socioeconomic groups, and to identify priority populations for future public health interventions.

### Impact of parity on gestational diabetes mellitus in Chinese women: a retrospective cohort study [^116NGJWw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

We have identified a discrepancy between the crude prevalence of GDM reported in Table 1 and the adjusted results presented in Table 2. This observed difference may be attributed to several confounding factors, most notably the differential distribution of maternal age across parity groups, as advanced maternal age is strongly correlated with higher parity. Our analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between parity and maternal age (P interaction < 0.05), with multiparity demonstrating the most substantial protective effect against GDM among women under 30 years of age. While existing research has predominantly focused on women over 35 years as a high-risk population for GDM, our data demonstrated that multiparae below 30 years exhibit a significantly reduced incidence of GDM, consistent with the findings of Hui et al. In contrast, this protective association was not statistically significant in women aged 30 years and above, possibly due to age-related metabolic alterations, including diminished insulin sensitivity and accumulated metabolic comorbidities, which may attenuate the beneficial effects of multiparity. Additionally, physiological changes associated with reproductive aging, such as declining ovarian function and reduced placental efficiency, may compound GDM risk in older women. These factors collectively underscore the complex interplay between parity and age in determining GDM risk, where the potential benefits of multiparity may be counterbalanced by the progressive metabolic and reproductive changes accompanying advancing maternal age.

A key strength of this study lies in its large sample size, which enhances the robustness and generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, we explored the interaction between parity and other risk factors for GDM, providing novel insights into how maternal age modifies this association. Our results underscore the importance of age-specific considerations in clinical and public health strategies for GDM prevention. However, several limitations should be noted. Firstly, GDM diagnosis was based solely on clinical records, which may introduce misclassification bias. Secondly, as a single-center study, the generalizability of our findings may be limited. Finally, as an observational register-based cohort study, we lacked detailed data on potential confounders such as family history of diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diet, physical activity, and sleep patterns. If these factors differentially affect primiparae and multiparae or vary by maternal age, they could influence the observed associations.

### Pregnancy outcome at extremely advanced maternal age [^112wmoZS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate pregnancy outcome in women at extremely advanced maternal age (≥ 45 years).

Study Design

We compared the condition of women aged ≥ 45 years (n = 177) in a 10:1 ratio (20–29, 30–39, and 40–44 years.). Subgroup analysis compared the condition of women aged 45–49 years with those women aged ≥ 50 years.

Results

The rates of gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertensive complications were higher for the study group, compared with the whole group (17.0% vs 5.6% and 19.7% vs 4.5%, respectively; P < .001), as was the rate of preterm delivery at < 37 and < 34 weeks of gestation (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–3.6 and OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4–9.0, respectively). The rates of cesarean delivery (OR, 31.8; 95% CI, 18.0–56.1), placenta previa, postpartum hemorrhage, and adverse neonatal outcome were significantly higher among the study group. The risk for gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia toxemia, preterm delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admission was increased for women aged ≥ 50 years.

Conclusion

Pregnancy at extreme advanced maternal age is associated with increased maternal and fetal risk.

### A clinical update on gestational diabetes mellitus [^112VsPoi]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent HAPO-FUS data confirming the long-term impact of maternal hyperglycemia on maternal and offspring metabolic health highlight an important paradigm shift. The approach to GDM should reflect an evidence base that evaluates diagnostic glucose thresholds and measurement within a framework that includes timing of detection and treatment trials with long-term clinical and health economic outcomes. For example, if the ongoing Treatment of Booking Gestational Diabetes Mellitus trial demonstrates a benefit for early GDM detection and treatment, there are implications for the prevailing diagnostic GDM glucose thresholds in later pregnancy. This is because these thresholds were derived from the risk of perinatal complications in a heterogeneous GDM cohort, which included women who would fulfill early GDM criteria.

Other important areas for research include the evaluation of dietary interventions establishing the optimal carbohydrate threshold in GDM, further clarity on the potential long-term impact of intrauterine metformin on the offspring, as well as the efficacy of preconception and early pregnancy preventive strategies targeting risk factors other than glycemia, such as maternal obesity and GWG. Improved obstetric assessment of placental function, especially in late pregnancy, to inform timing of delivery and identify women at highest risk of stillbirth in GDM is also needed.

The complications of GDM may indeed be greater based on the severity of maternal glycemia and associated vascular risk factors. Nevertheless, the traditional focus on diagnostic criteria and short-term antenatal maternal glucose management fails to address the importance of identifying "milder" (IADPSG-defined) GDM as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring diabetes and CVD risk. It should also be apparent that the increasing prevalence of GDM largely reflects the worsening metabolic health burden including prediabetes and obesity in women of childbearing age. The clinical focus for GDM must therefore urgently shift to early postnatal prevention strategies to decrease the progression from GDM to type 2 diabetes and address longer term maternal and offspring cardiometabolic risk post-GDM via a life course management approach.

### Ohio primary health care providers' practices and attitudes regarding screening women with prior gestational diabetes for type 2 diabetes mellitus-2010… [^114MJsGj]. CDC (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with a 7-fold increased lifetime risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is crucial for preventing complications. Despite recommendations for type 2 diabetes screening every 1 to 3 years for women with previous diagnoses of GDM and all women aged 45 years or older, screening prevalence is unknown. We sought to assess Ohio primary health care providers' practices and attitudes regarding assessing GDM history and risk for progression to type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Because knowing a patient's GDM history is the critical first step in the prevention of progression to type 2 diabetes for women who had GDM, suboptimal screening for both GDM history and subsequent glucose abnormalities demonstrates missed opportunities for identifying and counseling women with increased risk for type 2 diabetes.

Women with diagnosed GDM are at as much as an 84% increased risk for GDM during subsequent pregnancies, and the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus during their lifetime is approximately 7-fold greater than that for women with normoglycemic pregnancies. Prior analyses suggest that cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes ranges from 20% to 60% within 10 years of GDM diagnosis, plateauing thereafter. P = 0. 85). Sixty-two percent of all respondents reported screening every 1 to 3 years for glucose intolerance among nonpregnant women aged 45 years or younger with a history of GDM.

Sixty-four percent of respondents strongly agreed that "GDM has long-term implications for a woman's health"; 65% strongly agreed that "It is part of my job to help women with a history of GDM to improve their diet and exercise regularly"; 70% strongly agreed that "It is important for me to increase patient knowledge of future risk for type 2 diabetes among patients with a history of GDM"; and 71% strongly agreed that "There is a need for periodic screening for type 2 diabetes among women with a history of GDM". This study assessed the care provided to women with prior GDM. Lifestyle modifications aimed at weight loss and physical activity are effective for decreasing progression to type 2 diabetes, and both the ADA and ACOG recommend diet, exercise, and weight management counseling for women with high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

### Which dietary pattern should be adopt by age-appropriate pregnant women to avoid gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus [^1125Tqv6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, advanced maternal age presents additional challenges, as it is associated with elevated risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth. Our study revealed a particularly pronounced association between HEI/AHEI dietary patterns and GWG among older pregnant women. These findings highlight the importance of dietary interventions for this high-risk population. Specifically, we recommend strict adherence to the HEI-2015 and AHEI-2010 dietary guidelines as an effective strategy to mitigate GWG risks, with particular emphasis on women of advanced maternal age.

Although there was no association between DII and GWG in this study, other study has been found higher inflammatory level associated with higher GWG rate in the pregnant women. In addition, diets with higher HEI/AHEI scores, characterized by abundant fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, improve insulin sensitivity by reducing postprandial glucose spikes and systemic inflammation. These diets are rich in fiber and antioxidants, which enhance pancreatic β-cell function and mitigate oxidative stress. Thus, pregnant women are not advised to ignore the diet-related inflammation. All pregnant women should be encouraged to consume a healthier diet throughout their pregnancy to prevent adverse maternal and fetal outcomes due to the development of GWG.

Anti-inflammatory diet and DASH were recommended to adhere to prevent GDM during pregnancy based on our study. A Finnish study revealed that a high inflammatory potential of the diet was associated with an increased risk of GDM, which was consistent with our founding. Dietary fats were regarded as one reason factor between inflammation and GDM, they could increase the presence of chronic, systemic inflammation due to total fat, SFAs, and trans fatty acids have a high inflammatory potential. DASH eating plan, which was rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, is a low-GI low-energy-dense diet, used to lower blood pressure, initially. However, it has also been reported playing an important role in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis concluded that diets resembling DASH diet in early pregnancy were associated with lower risks or odds of GDM. Moreover, other high-quality diets were also recommended for pregnant women to adhere. It was reported that a high AHEI 2010 score was associated with a reduced risk of GDM by 19% or 46%.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with young-onset type 2 diabetes: the impact of age of diabetes diagnosis and duration of diabetes [^112JQTAL]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Outside of pregnancy, young‐onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (YT2DM) is more aggressive compared with older‐onset T2DM, with different age cut‐offs proposed to define 'young‐onset'.
Our data suggest that an earlier age of YT2DM diagnosis and a longer duration of YT2DM, but not maternal age, are associated with excess gestational weight gain and higher mean pregnancy HbA1c.
We observed increased rates of pre‐eclampsia and significant proteinuria with an earlier age of YT2DM diagnosis, however this was potentially mediated by factors including glycaemia.
The age of YT2DM diagnosis/duration of YT2DM, and not just maternal age, needs to be considered when assessing pregnancy risk.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus [^113mgASj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although it has been accepted for decades that women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk for future development of type 2 diabetes, vigorous debate regarding the value of detecting and treating GDM has persisted into the twenty-first century. Although results from 2 randomized trials provide strong evidence that treating GDM reduces adverse perinatal outcomes, it remains to be determined whether treatment impacts long-term offspring outcomes. Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic treatment and is added when glycemic goals are not met with nutritional modifications. Oral agent use is controversial, as data on long-term offspring outcomes are lacking.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^1156S59X]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Risk of pregnancy-related morbidity by maternal age — Risks increase progressively with advancing age, particularly older than 40 years. A retrospective cohort analysis using a large US population database of nearly 34 million deliveries characterized pregnancy-related morbidity risk by age, and overall women aged 35 years or older were at increased risk compared with those aged 25 to 29 years. When evaluated in age-based increments (35–39, 40–44, and 45–54 years), the risk increased with increasing age with relative risk [RR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–1.39; RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.77–1.89; and RR, 3.33; 95% CI, 3.03–3.66, respectively. Chronic medical disorders such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are more prevalent in pregnant individuals aged 35 years or older.

### Identifying women with gestational diabetes based on maternal characteristics: an analysis of four Norwegian prospective studies [^115EKP2a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy which is clearly not overt diabetes. GDM is associated with higher maternal and neonatal morbidities in the short- and long-term and predisposes both women and their offspring to later development of type 2 diabetes. Screening followed by treatment of GDM reduces the risk of several pregnancy complications. However, there is no worldwide agreement on the best diagnostic thresholds to define GDM, and a wide variety of clinical guidelines have been employed.

In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended glycaemic thresholds for the diagnosis of GDM based on findings from the multinational Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study demonstrating a linear dose-response between maternal glycaemia and adverse neonatal outcomes. These criteria were determined to identify women with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 for adverse events in their offspring relative to the mean. Glucose values set to identify women with a higher risk, corresponding to an adjusted OR of 2.0, were also considered but this proposal was rejected. Nonetheless, several countries, among them Canada and Norway, adopted the latter noting the substantial rise in GDM prevalence by 2013 WHO criteria, without clear evidence of clinically important benefits. The prior WHO criteria, established in 1999 and used in Norway until 2017, were identical to those for diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a non-pregnant population.

Controversy surrounds not only the thresholds values of glycemia, but also the optimal approach for identifying women with GDM. A high-risk approach has traditionally been recommended based on easily available maternal characteristics such as advanced age and BMI, known to be associated with an increased risk of GDM. However, although this approach reduces unnecessary testing in those least likely to test positive, a key issue is their performance as indicators for diagnostic testing and the usefulness of risk factors in a clinical setting today. The alternative option, universal screening, has a high detection rate but poses a large immediate burden to healthcare services as well as pregnant women.

In this study that merged data from four existing Norwegian pregnancy and birth cohorts, we aimed to address some of the clinical controversies related to GDM diagnosis and screening. The objectives were: 1) To establish the prevalence of GDM with three diagnostic criteria (1999 WHO, 2013 WHO, and the 2017 Norwegian criteria), 2) identify cut-off levels for age and BMI that identify at least 80% of women with GDM and 3) assess the predictive accuracy of commonly used risk factors.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112tS5K7]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes risk assessment — risk-increasing and lower-risk factors include age, body mass index (BMI), family history, and race/ethnicity: Several factors increase a person's risk for developing gestational diabetes, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of diabetes (particularly a history of diabetes in a first-degree relative) or a racial/ethnic group that is at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Islander descent); factors associated with a lower risk include younger than 25 to 30 years, White race, a BMI of 25 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), no history (in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to gestational diabetes; in Asian American persons, the prevalence of gestational diabetes at a BMI of 22 to less than 25 is similar to the prevalence in Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic White persons, and Black persons with a higher (> 28) BMI.

### Meta-analysis of risk factors for recurrent gestational diabetes mellitus [^112taNaq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Age of pregnancy

In this study, univariate and multivariate analysis results showed that older pregnancy (age ≥ 35 years) increased the risk of recurrence of GDM, which was statistically significant. This was consistent with the results of most relevant studies. Age is one of the risk factors for GDM and is also a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. As early as 2014, the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus clearly stated that advanced age is a risk factor for GDM in Chinese pregnant women. The structure and function of the vascular system change with age, and dysfunctional endothelial cells can increase the risk of insulin resistance in patients, which in turn increases the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic syndromes. Lao's study showed that women over the age of 40 were 8.2 times more likely to have recurrent GDM when they became pregnant again than women aged 20–30. Al-Goblan's study also believed that with aging, the body's ability to adjust blood glucose, pancreatic insulin secretion capacity, and the affinity between insulin receptor and insulin decreased, leading to abnormal glucose metabolism. Hence, GDM recurrence risk increases in older pregnant women.

### Progression to type 2 diabetes in women with a known history of gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116skPBz]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, which is clearly not either pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A previous diagnosis of GDM is an established risk factor for developing T2DM in later life, a fact that highlights the importance of postpartum screening to identify those at higher risk of progression and introduce strategies for disease prevention. Despite the magnitude of the risk, attendance for postpartum screening is suboptimal, as reported by studies from European countries, the United States, and Canada. An overall lack of awareness of the need for screening and the increased risk for future T2DM in this patient group is apparent. Healthcare providers lack familiarity with, and adherence to, guidelines, and are uncertain as to whether the responsibility for screening these women lies with primary or secondary care. Meanwhile, the prevalence of T2DM is rising globally, with individuals diagnosed with the disease being at higher risk of all cause mortality.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115iNZ62]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiology and risks of gestational diabetes — Prevalence of gestational diabetes in the US has been estimated at 5.8% to 9.2% based on traditional diagnostic criteria (may be higher with more inclusive criteria), and pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications including preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia (which can cause shoulder dystocia and birth injury), and neonatal hypoglycemia, with associations also noted with several long-term health outcomes in pregnant persons and intermediate outcomes in their offspring.

### The IDEAL study: investigation of dietary advice and lifestyle for women with borderline gestational diabetes: a randomised controlled trial-study protocol [^116QwLki]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus: the burden of disease

The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is rising worldwide, with recent Australian estimates indicating that between 5.2% and 8.8% of pregnant women develop GDM. Risk factors for GDM include the mother's own birthweight, maternal obesity, advanced maternal age, ethnicity, family history of diabetes and a previous history of GDM, large babies or unexplained stillbirth.

In Australia each year, between 6.3% and 7.7%, or between 15,900 and 19,450 pregnant women have a positive oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) on screening for GDM followed by a normal diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test result (OGTT). These women have borderline gestational diabetes with values of glucose tolerance intermediate between normal and those diagnostic of GDM.

There are well-documented risks for the infant of a mother with GDM including fetal macrosomia, birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia, bone fractures and nerve palsies, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and hyperbilirubinaemia. A later complication associated with macrosomia and large-for-gestational age, for female offspring, is premenopausal breast cancer. Long-term adverse health outcomes reported for the infants include obesity, impaired intellectual achievement, impairment of glucose tolerance and increased risk for subsequent diabetes.

For women with GDM there is an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia and an increased need for induction of labour. Impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy is highly predictive for the later development of diabetes, with over 50% of women with GDM developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years of the index pregnancy. Although the perinatal risks of GDM are well documented, the impact of borderline gestational diabetes on maternal and infant health outcomes is less clear.

### Through the looking glass: gestational diabetes as a predictor of maternal and offspring long-term health [^115fumvZ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is gaining in importance as a predictor of future health risks for women and their offspring. In women, it is associated with increased long-term risks of diabetes, metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular disorders. For offspring of mothers with GDM, risks of GDM include abnormal glucose tolerance, obesity and metabolic syndrome. This review presents the evidence for GDM as a predictor of long-term health risks for mothers and their offspring. We highlight GDM as an opportune time to screen for and possibly intervene to prevent adverse health outcomes for both women and their offspring.

### Evaluation of neonatal and maternal morbidity in mothers with gestational diabetes: a population-based study [^116us79C]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have shown that the risk of developing GDM increases with women's age and prepregnancy BMI. We demonstrated that GDM results in serious negative outcomes at birth for mothers and their offspring, with possible long-term effects on their health. As the risk of GDM increases with mothers' BMI, age, and low-income status, those factors should be taken into account when preventive intervention strategies are developed and the target risk group is established. The high incidence of GDM reported in this paper is clear evidence of the need for general screening for GDM.

### Modifiable risk factors for developing diabetes among women… [^111dt6YA]. stacks.cdc.gov (2006). Low credibility.

Details: Journal Article: Preventing Chronic Disease Personal Author: Description: Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus affects approximately 2% to 4% of all pregnant women in the United States each year. Women who have had GDM are at high risk for developing nongestational diabetes. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of modifiable risk factors for developing diabetes among women with previous GDM only. Methods Cross-sectional data for nonpregnant women from the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to estimate and compare the prevalence of modifiable risk factors among three groups: nonpregnant women with previous GDM only, nonpregnant women with current diabetes, and nonpregnant women without diabetes. Results. In 2003, 7. 6% of nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older in the United States had current self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, and

1. 5% had previous GDM only.

Compared with women without diabetes, women with previous GDM only had higher prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity, overweight, and obesity. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, women with previous GDM only were more likely to have no leisure-time physical activity and more likely to be overweight or obese, compared with women with no diabetes. Conclusion Women with previous GDM are more likely to have modifiable risk factors for developing diabetes than women without diabetes. More attention to this issue is needed from health care providers and public health officials to encourage the promotion of healthy lifestyles during and after pregnancy.

### A clinical update on gestational diabetes mellitus [^111LB1mc]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Essential Points

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is 1 of the most common medical complications of pregnancy and is increasing in prevalence globally.
GDM is associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily due to increased birthweight and is a major risk factor for future type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease in mother and child.
Detecting GDM is important because perinatal complications and stillbirth risk are greatly reduced by treatment.
A precision medicine approach to GDM which recognizes severity and onset of maternal hyperglycemia as well as genetic and physiologic subtypes of GDM may address the current diagnostic controversy via accurate risk stratification and individualized treatment strategies, leading to improved clinical care models and outcomes.
The traditional focus on normalization of obstetric and neonatal outcomes achieved via short-term antenatal maternal glucose management should now shift to early postnatal prevention strategies to decrease the progression from GDM to type 2 diabetes and address longer term maternal and offspring metabolic risk given the global epidemic of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

### Evidence in support of the international association of diabetes in pregnancy study groups' criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus worldwide in 2019 [^1175zHgJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus, the most frequent medical complication of pregnancy, affects 5–6% of women in the United States with the use of the currently predominant Carpenter-Coustan criteria, which still represent the preferred approach of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Alternative criteria proposed by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups would likely increase gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence to 15–20%, because of both a 1-step testing policy and the requirement for only 1 elevated glucose value for diagnosis. Increasing gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence relates to older maternal age and the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity. This increased gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence is consistent with 29.3% prevalence of prediabetes and 4.5% prevalence of known diabetes outside pregnancy in US adults from 20–44 years of age. Gestational diabetes mellitus according to the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria is associated with almost twice the risk of large-for-gestational-age babies, increased fetal adiposity, neonatal hyperinsulinemia and preeclampsia, and a 50% higher risk of preterm delivery and shoulder dystocia. The recent publication of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study provides further evidence regarding the influence of gestational diabetes mellitus on long-term maternal and infant health. This study clearly demonstrates that hyperglycemia in pregnancy, untreated and identified post hoc by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria, carries a 41.5% risk of maternal prediabetes (odds ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 3.09–4.47) and 10.7% risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 7.63; 95% confidence interval, 5.33–10.95) after 11.4 years of follow up. Gestational diabetes mellitus was also associated with higher rates of childhood overweight and obesity (prevalence 39.3% with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus; odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.56–2.44). This article places these findings in the context of other recent studies that have demonstrated that interventions that include lifestyle measures and/or metformin offer a > 50% reduction in the risk of women with gestational diabetes mellitus experiencing the development of overt diabetes mellitus after their index gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancy. Although prevention of obesity and prediabetes in offspring by pregnancy treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus has not been demonstrated to date, we argue that the immediate pregnancy benefits and opportunities for long-term improvements in maternal health justify a reevaluation of the current ambivalent approach taken by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis, which currently allow for a choice of alternative criteria. The Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group criteria, listed as preferred criteria by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, markedly limit the frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus in comparison with the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria and limit the opportunity for immediate and long-term follow up and treatment. We consider that new information from the Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study and other recent publications on long-term maternal and offspring risk provides compelling arguments for a more comprehensive approach to the promotion of maternal and infant health through all the life cycle.

### The effect of advanced maternal age on perinatal outcomes in nulliparous singleton pregnancies [^117X8FWL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy at advanced maternal age has become more common in both developed and developing countries over the last decades. The association between adverse perinatal outcomes and advanced maternal age has been a matter of controversy in several studies. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of advanced maternal age on perinatal and neonatal outcomes of nulliparous singleton pregnancies.

Methods

Records of patients admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Cukurova School of Medicine, between January 2011 and July 2015 for routine mid-trimester fetal ultrasonography were retrospectively reviewed. The control (age: 18–34 years), advanced maternal age (35–39 years), and very advanced maternal age (> 40 years) groups included 471, 399, and 87 women, respectively.

Results

Gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and cesarean delivery rates were more common in the very advanced maternal age group, with compared with the advanced maternal age and the younger age group. There were no significant differences in regarding rates of spontaneous preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation, prolonged rupture of membranes, large for gestational age infants, and operative vaginal delivery rates between the groups. Also, there were no significant differences regarding in APGAR scores, the rate of low birth weight infants, and neonatal morbidity rates between the groups. However, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit requirement was more common in the two advanced maternal age groups compared with the control group.

Conclusion

Advanced maternal age is a risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, small for gestational age infants, spontaneous late preterm delivery, and cesarean section, with significant potential clinical implications.

### Association between very advanced maternal age and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a cross sectional Japanese study [^114YHH2o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy at advanced maternal age (over 35 years) has increased in many high income countries over the past several decades, with recent rates reported to be as high as 9.1% in the US, and 28.1% in Japan. In Japan, one of the Asian countries which has experienced a considerable increase in average age at pregnancy, the number of births from women of very advanced age, such as 40–45 and ≥ 45 years of age, has also surged, with recent numbers in 2015 to be 52,557 (5.2%) and 1038 (0.1%), respectively. Such increase in average maternal age has also been observed in many parts of Asia, such as Korea, China, and Taiwan, which may be attributable to the increase in women's participation in society in these countries.

A number of studies have demonstrated that pregnancy among women of advanced age is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placenta previa, cesarean section, preterm birth, low birthweight, maternal mortality, and perinatal mortality. However, most studies have focused on adverse outcomes among women aged ≥ 35, or ≥ 40, and the few which have studied birth outcomes of pregnancies of older women (i.e. over 45 years of age) suffer from limitations. For example, most studies were conducted nearly 20 years ago, when such women were likely to be multiparous and have conceived naturally without artificial reproductive technologies (ART), unlike the women who conceive at similar ages today. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the effect of older age on the risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as cesarean delivery and preeclampsia, may significantly differ by method of conception and parity because women who conceive by ART have a higher risk for a number of adverse perinatal outcomes, and parity also has a significant effect on the risk of cesarean section and preeclampsia. However, only one recent study conducted in 217 women in Australia considered this potential effect modification on a limited number of birth outcomes.

In order to address the yet unanswered questions related to this association, we used the Japanese national multicenter-based delivery registry, which includes a relatively large group of women of advanced age, and evaluated the association between adverse birth outcomes and very advanced maternal age, and whether this association differed by maternal characteristics, namely parity and method of conception. Such information would be useful to clinicians when providing antenatal counseling to women of very advanced age.

### Dysglycemia in pregnancy and maternal / fetal outcomes [^113JNR4c]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Maternal dysglycemia — including diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and impaired fasting glucose — affects one in six pregnancies worldwide and represents a significant health risk to the mother and the fetus. Maternal dysglycemia is an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality, major congenital anomalies, and miscarriages. Furthermore, it increases the longer-term risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular morbidity, malignancies, and ophthalmic, psychiatric, and renal diseases in the mother. The most commonly encountered form of maternal dysglycemia is gestational diabetes. Currently, international consensus does not exist for diagnostic criteria defining gestational diabetes at 24–28 weeks gestation, and potential diagnostic glucose thresholds earlier in gestation require further investigation. Likewise, recommendations regarding the timing and modality (e.g. lifestyle or pharmacological) of treatment vary greatly. Because a precise diagnosis determines the appropriate treatment and outcome of the pregnancy, it is imperative that a better definition of maternal dysglycemia and its treatment be achieved. This article will address some of the controversies related to diagnosing and managing maternal dysglycemia. In addition, the article will discuss the impact of maternal dysglycemia on complications experienced by the mother and infant, both at birth and in later life.

### What we have learned about treating mild gestational diabetes mellitus [^115r6Bnw]. Seminars in Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, with risks not only associated with more severe forms of GDM, but milder forms of GDM as well. Treatment of mild GDM with dietary intervention and insulin when necessary has proven to be effective in reducing the risks of several, but not all, adverse perinatal outcomes. Less is known about the long-term benefits of mild GDM treatment. This article will review the benefits of mild GDM treatment, and related risk factors, on short-term and long-term maternal and neonatal/child outcomes, with an emphasis on research conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network.

### Association of gestational diabetes with subsequent long-term risk of mortality [^114e65RR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Gestational diabetes has been associated with numerous chronic diseases. However, few studies have examined the association of gestational diabetes with long-term mortality risk.

Objective

To investigate the associations between gestational diabetes and long-term risks of total and cause-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed participants of the Nurses' Health Study II who were followed for 30 years (1989–2019). Participants included US female nurses aged 25 to 42 years who reported at least 1 pregnancy (≥ 6 months) at 18 years or older across their reproductive life span. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2022, to May 25, 2023.

Exposure

Gestational diabetes across the reproductive life span.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hazard ratios (HRs with 95% CIs) for total and cause-specific mortality were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

A total of 91 426 parous participants were included, with a mean (SD) age of 34.9 (4.7) years and a body mass index of 24.1 (4.7) at baseline. During a follow-up period of 2 609 753 person-years, 3937 deaths were documented, including 255 deaths from cardiovascular disease and 1397 from cancer. Participants with a history of gestational diabetes had a higher crude mortality rate than those without a history of gestational diabetes (1.74 vs 1.49 per 1000 person-years; absolute difference = 0.25 per 1000 person-years). The corresponding HR for total mortality was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.13–1.44), which did not materially change after additional adjustment for potential confounders and lifestyle factors during the reproductive life span (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11–1.41). The association persisted regardless of the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and was more robust among participants who adopted less healthy lifestyles; experienced gestational diabetes in 2 or more pregnancies (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.99–2.19); had gestational diabetes both in the initial and subsequent pregnancies (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11–2.63); and concurrently reported hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.21–2.67), preterm birth (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.66–3.64), or low birth weight (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.21–3.68). Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed that gestational diabetes was directly associated with the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03–2.47). Additionally, gestational diabetes was inversely associated with cancer mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98); however, it was only evident among participants who later developed type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this cohort study suggest that participants who reported a history of gestational diabetes exhibited a small but elevated risk of subsequent mortality over 30 years. The findings emphasize the importance of considering gestational diabetes as a critical factor in later-life mortality risk.

### Treatments for women with gestational diabetes mellitus: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^114LLkAf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Successful treatments for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have the potential to improve health outcomes for women with GDM and their babies.

Objectives

To provide a comprehensive synthesis of evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews of the benefits and harms associated with interventions for treating GDM on women and their babies.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (5 January 2018) for reviews of treatment/management for women with GDM. Reviews of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes were excluded. Two overview authors independently assessed reviews for inclusion, quality (AMSTAR; ROBIS), quality of evidence (GRADE), and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 14 reviews. Of these, 10 provided relevant high-quality and low-risk of bias data (AMSTAR and ROBIS) from 128 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 27 comparisons, 17,984 women, 16,305 babies, and 1441 children. Evidence ranged from high- to very low-quality (GRADE). Only one effective intervention was found for treating women with GDM. EffectiveLifestyle versus usual careLifestyle intervention versus usual care probably reduces large-for-gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71; 6 RCTs, N = 2994; GRADE moderate-quality). PromisingNo evidence for any outcome for any comparison could be classified to this category. Ineffective or possibly harmful Lifestyle versus usual careLifestyle intervention versus usual care probably increases the risk of induction of labour (IOL) suggesting possible harm (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.46; 4 RCTs, N = 2699; GRADE moderate-quality). Exercise versus controlExercise intervention versus control for return to pre-pregnancy weight suggested ineffectiveness (body mass index, BMI) MD 0.11 kg/m², 95% CI -1.04 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, N = 254; GRADE moderate-quality). Insulin versus oral therapyInsulin intervention versus oral therapy probably increases the risk of IOL suggesting possible harm (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 3 RCTs, N = 348; GRADE moderate-quality). Probably ineffective or harmful interventionsInsulin versus oral therapyFor insulin compared to oral therapy there is probably an increased risk of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.12; 4 RCTs, N = 1214; GRADE moderate-quality). InconclusiveLifestyle versus usual careThe evidence for childhood adiposity kg/m² (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 RCTs, N = 767; GRADE moderate-quality) and hypoglycaemia was inconclusive (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.52; 6 RCTs, N = 3000; GRADE moderate-quality). Exercise versus controlThe evidence for caesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 5 RCTs, N = 316; GRADE moderate quality) and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite was inconclusive (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.61; 2 RCTs, N = 169; GRADE moderate-quality). Insulin versus oral therapyThe evidence for the following outcomes was inconclusive: pre-eclampsia (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; 10 RCTs, N = 2060), caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 17 RCTs, N = 1988), large-for-gestational age (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; 13 RCTs, N = 2352), and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; 2 RCTs, N = 760). GRADE assessment was moderate-quality for these outcomes. Insulin versus dietThe evidence for perinatal mortality was inconclusive (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.33; 4 RCTs, N = 1137; GRADE moderate-quality). Insulin versus insulinThe evidence for insulin aspart versus lispro for risk of caesarean section was inconclusive (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; 3 RCTs, N = 410; GRADE moderate quality). No conclusions possibleNo conclusions were possible for: lifestyle versus usual care (perineal trauma, postnatal depression, neonatal adiposity, number of antenatal visits/admissions); diet versus control (pre-eclampsia, caesarean section); myo-inositol versus placebo (hypoglycaemia); metformin versus glibenclamide (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, death or serious morbidity composite, insulin versus oral therapy (development of type 2 diabetes); intensive management versus routine care (IOL, large-for-gestational age); post- versus pre-prandial glucose monitoring (large-for-gestational age). The evidence ranged from moderate-, low- and very low-quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently there is insufficient high-quality evidence about the effects on health outcomes of relevance for women with GDM and their babies for many of the comparisons in this overview comparing treatment interventions for women with GDM. Lifestyle changes (including as a minimum healthy eating, physical activity and self-monitoring of blood sugar levels) was the only intervention that showed possible health improvements for women and their babies. Lifestyle interventions may result in fewer babies being large. Conversely, in terms of harms, lifestyle interventions may also increase the number of inductions. Taking insulin was also associated with an increase in hypertensive disorders, when compared to oral therapy. There was very limited information on long-term health and health services costs. Further high-quality research is needed.

### Progression to type 2 diabetes in women with a known history of gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116CSeJc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Previous systematic reviews have highlighted the increased risk of developing T2DM after GDM. Kim et al, in 2002, identified a cumulative incidence of T2DM of between 2.6% to over 70% in studies with a total follow-up ranging from six weeks to 28 years; this incidence was highest in the first five postpartum years. In 2009, Bellamy et al showed a sevenfold higher risk of T2DM in patients with GDM in comparison with healthy controls (relative risk 7.43, 95% confidence interval 4.79 to 11.51). A further systematic review evaluated the rate of compliance with screening, and the prevalence of T2DM in Asian women, reporting incidences of between 2.8% and 58% in women with previous GDM.

Over recent decades, the demography of pregnant women has changed, with an increase in the rate of women giving birth at a more advanced age, and obesity rates also rising. Both these factors have led to a rise in the prevalence of GDM, establishing the disease as an imminent concern globally. From a public health perspective, this increased prevalence of GDM could contribute to the rising global health burden of obesity and T2DM. To deal with this problem, research has focused on improving the quality and effectiveness of screening and diagnosis of GDM. In addition to changes in the guidelines for GDM, changes have also occurred in the diagnostic criteria for T2DM, in an effort to identify populations at a higher risk. Thus there is a need to evaluate more recent evidence on the risk of progression to T2DM in women with previous GDM compared with those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy, investigating outcomes in ethnically diverse populations, and over a longer follow-up period. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate progression rates, and factors that could determine progression to T2DM, in women diagnosed with GDM compared with those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy, using recent evidence and including an assessment of both length of follow-up and ethnicity.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113S4HDN]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes treatment — maternal and infant outcomes after 24 weeks are summarized as follows: Harms associated with the treatment were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235), and treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after was not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants. Treatment of gestational diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of macrosomia (> 4000 g) (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68]) but no difference in the risk of total number of cesarean deliveries (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08]), and there was no observed difference of small for gestational age infants based on race/ethnicity or glycemic status.

### Dysglycemia in pregnancy and maternal / fetal outcomes [^114wxqiT]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Maternal dysglycemia-including diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and impaired fasting glucose-affects one in six pregnancies worldwide and represents a significant health risk to the mother and the fetus. Maternal dysglycemia is an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality, major congenital anomalies, and miscarriages. Furthermore, it increases the longer-term risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular morbidity, malignancies, and ophthalmic, psychiatric, and renal diseases in the mother. The most commonly encountered form of maternal dysglycemia is gestational diabetes. Currently, international consensus does not exist for diagnostic criteria defining gestational diabetes at 24–28 weeks gestation, and potential diagnostic glucose thresholds earlier in gestation require further investigation. Likewise, recommendations regarding the timing and modality (e.g., lifestyle or pharmacological) of treatment vary greatly. Because a precise diagnosis determines the appropriate treatment and outcome of the pregnancy, it is imperative that a better definition of maternal dysglycemia and its treatment be achieved. This article will address some of the controversies related to diagnosing and managing maternal dysglycemia. In addition, the article will discuss the impact of maternal dysglycemia on complications experienced by the mother and infant, both at birth and in later life.

### Gestational diabetes-screening, prevalence and postpartum diabetes: population-based cohort study [^1173sasA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition of glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy, which can be diagnosed at any stage of gestation, with early GDM (before 20 weeks) often associated with worse pregnancy outcomes compared with late‐onset GDM (diagnosed at 24–28 weeks). During pregnancy, rising insulin resistance peaks in late gestation, while β ‐cell compensation varies. In some women, inadequate β ‐cell response leads to hyperglycemia, with early‐onset GDM linked to greater metabolic dysfunction. The prevalence of GDM varies widely across regions and populations, ranging from approximately 7% in North America and Europe to over 27% in the Middle East and North Africa. This variability is influenced by differences in diagnostic criteria, screening strategies, and population characteristics. Additionally, global trends, including increasing rates of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), have contributed to a rising prevalence of GDM over time. Risk factors for GDM include ethnicity, maternal factors such as advanced age, high parity, and overweight, as well as a family history of DM, excessive weight gain during pregnancy, short stature, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), history of previous GDM, and multifoetal pregnancies.

Effective management of GDM is essential to normalise maternal blood glucose levels and prevent complications for both the mother and the foetus. Short‐term consequences for women with GDM include obstetric complications such as gestational hypertension, pre‐eclampsia, and cesarean section. Neonatal complications include large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome and birth trauma such as shoulder dystocia. Women with a history of GDM have a significantly increased risk of recurrent GDM in subsequent pregnancies, with recurrence rates reaching up to 84%. Additionally, they face a 20%–50% risk of developing T2D within 5–10 years postpartum. Offspring of mothers with GDM are also at heightened risk of early‐life obesity, insulin resistance, and long‐term cardiometabolic disorders.

Accurate data on GDM screening, prevalence, and complication rates are crucial for national healthcare planning. However, only a few countries, such as the United States, Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and Sweden collect GDM‐related data through national medical birth registries, quality registries or surveillance systems that include antenatal care and pregnancy outcomes rather than dedicated GDM registries. Australia is the only country that collects GDM data through a dedicated registry; however, its coverage is limited to regional levels.

### A meta-analysis of adverse offspring health outcomes in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus [^116ApnRD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the risk of chronic diseases, including obesity, glycolipid metabolic disorders, neurodevelopmental conditions and cardiovascular diseases, in offspring through a systematic meta-analysis. By searching PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane systematic review databases, relevant observational studies published from January 2010 to February 2024 were comprehensively retrieved, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the country status, offspring age, screening method and diagnostic criteria of GDM. A meta-regression model was used to assess the potential impact of study characteristics on the combined effect odds ratio (OR). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of individual studies on the overall results. Additionally, Egger's test and funnel plot analysis were utilized to assess potential publication bias. This meta-analysis included 32 studies, encompassing a total of 3310217 participants (90304 women with GDM and 3219913 controls). Offspring exposed to GDM exhibited significantly elevated risks of obesity and overweight (OR = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.35, 1.82]), diabetes (OR = 4.50, 95% CI [2.87, 7.70]), autism spectrum disorder (OR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.20, 1.59]) and intellectual disabilities (OR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.52, 1.90]). Furthermore, offspring of mothers with GDM demonstrated higher systolic blood pressure (mean difference [MD] = 2.33, 95% CI [0.92, 3.75]), diastolic blood pressure (MD = 0.53, 95% CI [0.09, 0.96]), body mass index (BMI) (MD = 0.62, 95% CI [0.45, 0.80]), z-BMI score (MD = 0.27, 95% CI [0.15, 0.39]), triglyceride levels (MD = 0.04, 95% CI [0.04, 0.04]) and LDL cholesterol levels (MD = 0.02, 95% CI [0.02, 0.02]) compared to controls. In conclusion, maternal GDM is significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in offspring. Subgroup and regression analyses revealed that this association was largely unaffected by factors such as country status, offspring age, GDM screening methods or diagnostic criteria. Sensitivity analysis and bias assessment indicated that the findings were robust, with no significant publication bias detected among the included studies. GDM is a significant risk factor for offspring developing glycolipid metabolic disorders, neurodevelopmental conditions and cardiovascular diseases. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the long-term health implications for offspring exposed to GDM, highlighting the elevated risk of chronic diseases in this population. These findings underscore the importance of implementing early preventive measures post-birth to mitigate the burden of associated chronic diseases.

### Effect of dietary and lifestyle factors on the risk of gestational diabetes: review of epidemiologic evidence [^116kyHrK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition in pregnancy, is a common pregnancy complication and a growing health concern. GDM has been related to significant short-term and long-term adverse health outcomes for both mothers and offspring. Importantly, this number is increasing with the increasing burden of obesity among women of reproductive age. Collectively, these data highlight the significance of understanding risk factors, in particular modifiable factors, for GDM and of preventing GDM among high-risk populations. Research in the past decade has identified a few diet and lifestyle factors that are associated with GDM risk. This review provides an overview of emerging diet and lifestyle factors that may contribute to the prevention of GDM. It also discusses major methodologic concerns about the available epidemiologic studies of GDM risk factors.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: risks and management during and after pregnancy [^1156M3jR]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carries a small but potentially important risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and a long-term risk of obesity and glucose intolerance in offspring. Mothers with GDM have an excess of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and a high risk of developing diabetes mellitus thereafter. Diagnosing and treating GDM can reduce perinatal complications, but only a small fraction of pregnancies benefit. Nutritional management is the cornerstone of treatment; insulin, glyburide and metformin can be used to intensify treatment. Fetal measurements complement maternal glucose monitoring in the identification of pregnancies that require such intensification. Glucose testing shortly after delivery can stratify the short-term diabetes risk in mothers. Thereafter, annual glucose and HbA(1c) testing can detect deteriorating glycaemic control, a harbinger of future diabetes mellitus, usually type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interventions that mitigate obesity or its metabolic effects are most potent in preventing or delaying diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle modification is the primary approach; use of medications for diabetes prevention after GDM remains controversial. Family planning enables optimization of health in subsequent pregnancies. Breastfeeding may reduce obesity in children and is recommended. Families should be encouraged to help children adopt lifestyles that reduce the risk of obesity.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^114FoqpF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Antepartum care — We suggest that pregnancy with anticipated delivery at the age of 35 years or older be recognized as a risk factor for adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes when counseling patients and determining management plans, and nuanced counselling will be dependent on the pregnant individual's specific age and comorbidities (GRADE 2C). Overall, when compared with those of younger ages, women aged 35 years or older are at higher risk for complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, labor dystocia, and cesarean delivery, and older women are also at risk of delivering a neonate who is born preterm (spontaneous or iatrogenic), requires neonatal intensive care unit admission, and has low birthweight.

### Development and validation of an early pregnancy risk score for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in Chinese pregnant women [^112qPuay]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is prevalent, affecting about 16.4% of women globally and 25.0% in the Southeast Asia region.GDM is associated with both short-term and long-term adverse health consequences for both the mother and her offspring. Women with GDM are at increased risk of perinatal morbidity. These women are also at particular high risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in their later life. Offspring born to women with GDM are at increased risk of obesity in childhoodand cardiovascular disease traits in adulthood.

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that lifestyle intervention among patients with GDM could improve pregnancy outcomes and reduce insulin resistance in the female offspring around 5 years of age. However, there were no studies reporting that intervention of GDM during pregnancy was able to reduce long-term risk of diabetes in this high risk group of women or reduce risk of childhood obesity in offspring of GDM mothers. So it is critical to prevent the occurrence of GDM. In this regard, several published RCT studies, such as UPBEAT, RADIEL, St CARLOS, have demonstrated that the interventions on modifiable risk factors or lifestyle during pregnancy could decrease the incidence of GDM among pregnant women. Early interventions, for example with the Mediterranean diet, have shown benefits in women even at low risk of GDMor diagnosed as GDM. Furthermore, our meta-analysisfound that lifestyle modification before the 15th gestational week (GW) could reduce the risk of GDM, but such intervention turned out ineffective once the pregnancy advanced beyond the 15th GW. Besides, we also showed that benefits of lifestyle intervention was not limited to overweight or obese women but also extended to women with normal body weight prior to pregnancy. Therefore, the key issue is to identify the group at high risk of GDM before the 15th GW or in early pregnancy so that lifestyle intervention can be done in a more cost-effective manner.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^114Vqhrt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — age-stratified morbidity risk and obstetric complications increase with advancing maternal age. A retrospective U.S. cohort of nearly 34 million deliveries found that risk rose across age increments 35–39, 40–44, and 45–54 years, with relative risk [RR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.33–1.39; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.77–1.89; and RR 3.33, 95% CI 3.03–3.66, respectively, and advancing maternal age was an independent risk factor for preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and gestational diabetes, with the 45–54-year group at the highest risk.

### The prevalence and risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KSmUT]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication, with a significant risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.

Aims

We aimed to explore the incidence and risk factors associated with the recurrence of GDM among women with a history of GDM.

Methods

We searched several databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, CINAHL, ProQuest, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and China Biology Medicine Database) from January 1961 to June 2024. We included only population-based studies that reported on GDM recurrence or risk factors among women, and differentiated between those with and without a history of GDM recurrence.

Results

We included 31 studies, of which 27 had a low risk of bias and 4 had a medium risk of bias. The incidence of GDM recurrence was 51% (95%CI: 0.48–0.55). Identified risk factors for GDM recurrence included maternal age (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.12–1.54), ethnicity (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.11–1.73), parity (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.04–3.23), family history of diabetes (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.44–2.97), history of macrosomia (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.28–2.83), insulin treatment during the index pregnancy (OR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.63–2.68), overweight or obesity before the index pregnancy (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.39–2.56), 1-h postprandial glucose levels on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during the index pregnancy (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.04–2.16), 2-h postprandial glucose levels on OGTT during the index pregnancy (OR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.11–3.81), two or more abnormal OGTT value at the index pregnancy (OR = 2.38; 95% CI: 1.88–3.02), weight gain between pregnancies (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.38–3.04), overweight or obesity before the subsequent pregnancy (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.20–1.69), weight gain before OGTT during the subsequent pregnancy (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.27–1.89), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels in the subsequent early pregnancy (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06–1.40).

Conclusions

The study found a high recurrence rate of GDM. Identifying risk factors highlights the need for early screening, and lifestyle interventions to reduce recurrence risk.

### Prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus using early-pregnancy data: a secondary analysis from a prospective cohort study in iran [^115Sz13d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition characterized by glucose intolerance during pregnancy, leading to hyperglycemia. It is associated with various complications for both mothers and their offspring. Maternal complications include an elevated risk of cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension, and polyhydramnios, with approximately 50% of affected individuals progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus within five years postpartum. For the fetus, GDM is associated with increased risks of stillbirth, preterm delivery, macrosomia, birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

The global prevalence of GDM is estimated at 14.0%, with its incidence projected to increase in the coming years. The growing burden of GDM has become a significant concern for healthcare providers worldwide. In this regard, early detection of individuals at higher risk for GDM could enable timely intervention, allowing for closer monitoring, early diagnosis, and the implementation of therapeutic strategies to mitigate its adverse effects on both mothers and babies.

Currently, the most widely accepted screening method for GDM is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), conducted between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, as recommended by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), and remains the standard GDM screening test in the Iranian medical community. Although proper management of GDM after diagnosis — through glycemic monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and insulin therapy if necessary — can reduce short-term complications, children born to mothers with GDM are still at higher risk for long-term health issues, including obesity and diabetes mellitus. A possible reason for these risks is fetal exposure to maternal hyperglycemia before GDM diagnosis, underscoring the importance of early detection.

Identifying predictors of GDM in early pregnancy may provide valuable insights into identifying women at high risk and enable earlier intervention. Previous studies have identified certain risk factors, including advanced maternal age, higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), multiparity, and a history of GDM or a family history of diabetes mellitus. However, the precise predictive ability of these factors, alongside early-pregnancy laboratory findings, remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the predictive value of maternal demographic, clinical, and early-pregnancy laboratory data for GDM. By focusing on easily measurable early-pregnancy markers, this study seeks to identify predictors that can facilitate earlier detection and risk stratification, ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.

4.2 Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this review include the extensive and thorough literature search to retrieve relevant eligible studies. The intention to investigate prognostic factors is critically different to prediction models which are used to predict the risk of current disease presence and outcome occurrence in individuals, thereby informing clinical diagnosis. Prognostic research may have an important impact on the translation of interventions from research to clinical practice, to inform health policy and improve patient outcomes. Limitations of the literature reviewed include the overall general moderate or high risk of bias of included studies, mainly because of the lack of adjustment for confounding factors or poor methods of reporting of statistical analyses. The criteria used for diagnosing GDM varied across the included studies, and several studies did not specify how the diagnosis was made. Meta‐analyses also have inherent weaknesses in terms of combining heterogeneous data sets. There was high heterogeneity (I² > 50%) for the pooled adjusted analyses for BMI as a continuous or categorical variable, and also for glucose. However, removing studies with a high risk of bias did not alter the effect estimates or heterogeneity, suggesting study quality does not appear to contribute to an overestimation of the magnitude of the effect that these risk factors have on risk for GDM. Comparatively, removing studies with a different direction of effect or with a larger than usual effect size, reduced heterogeneity indicating publication biases apparent. We could not evaluate clinical heterogeneity from the included studies. It is acknowledged that maternal age, BMI and ethnicity are risk factors for GDM. Yet although the studies in our review enroled younger and older pregnant women or women across the BMI spectrum, the studies did not specifically recruit women who were either younger or older, or with low or high BMI, thus sub‐groups could not be created. While many studies also included women across different ethnic groups, studies did not always report on the proportion of different ethnicities included, and where they did, they were not sufficiently homogenous across studies to make comparisons. Thus, the effect of age, BMI, or ethnicity, on the strength of the association with GDM could not be determined. Nevertheless, we did find that even after adjusting for age and BMI, the effect of the different MetS risk factors on GDM was similar to unadjusted analyses.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113siMDX]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) long-term risk and prevention — individuals with prior GDM have an increased lifetime maternal diabetes risk estimated at 50–60% and a 10-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes versus those without GDM; absolute risk after GDM rises across the lifespan, being ~20% at 10 years, 30% at 20 years, 40% at 30 years, 50% at 40 years, and 60% at 50 years; in a large retrospective cohort, hazard ratios ranged from 4.35 to 15.8-fold with multiple GDM pregnancies; interpregnancy weight gain is linked to higher risk, while in people with a BMI > 25 kg/m², weight loss is associated with lower subsequent GDM risk, and development of type 2 diabetes is 18% higher per unit of BMI increase from prepregnancy BMI; in individuals with prediabetes and a history of GDM, both metformin and intensive lifestyle intervention prevent or delay diabetes, with only five to six needing treatment to prevent one case over 3 years, and lifestyle intervention and metformin reduced progression by 35% and 40%, respectively, over 10 years; intensive lifestyle intervention and/or metformin should be implemented.

### Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on different risk profiles and settings for improving maternal and infant health [^117WTezy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mothers and their infants in the short and long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not screening all pregnant women for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate setting for screening. This review updates a Cochrane Review, first published in 2010, and subsequently updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (14 June 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings, compared with the absence of screening, or compared with other protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening. We planned to include trials published as abstracts only and cluster-randomised trials, but we did not identify any. Cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion or through consulting a third reviewer.

Main Results

We included two trials that randomised 4523 women and their infants. Both trials were conducted in Ireland. One trial (which quasi-randomised 3742 women, and analysed 3152 women) compared universal screening versus risk factor-based screening, and one trial (which randomised 781 women, and analysed 690 women) compared primary care screening versus secondary care screening. We were not able to perform meta-analyses due to the different interventions and comparisons assessed. Overall, there was moderate to high risk of bias due to one trial being quasi-randomised, inadequate blinding, and incomplete outcome data in both trials. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the quality of the evidence for selected outcomes for the mother and her child. Evidence was downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision of effect estimates. Universal screening versus risk-factor screening (one trial) MotherMore women were diagnosed with GDM in the universal screening group than in the risk-factor screening group (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 3.04; participants = 3152; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported under this comparison for other maternal outcomes including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean birth, perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, and type 2 diabetes. ChildNeonatal outcomes: large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite, hypoglycaemia; and childhood/adulthood outcomes: adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and neurosensory disability, were not reported under this comparison. Primary care screening versus secondary care screening (one trial) MotherThere was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for GDM (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.66; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), hypertension (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.59; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), pre-eclampsia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.78; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), or caesarean section birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; participants = 690; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported for perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, or type 2 diabetes. ChildThere was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for large-for-gestational age (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.96; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), neonatal complications: composite outcome, including: hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, need for phototherapy, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, five minute Apgar less than seven at one or five minutes, prematurity (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.71; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), or neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.38; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There was one perinatal death in the primary care screening group and two in the secondary care screening group (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.10 to 12.12; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There were no data for neurosensory disability, or childhood/adulthood adiposity or type 2 diabetes.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient randomised controlled trial data evaluating the effects of screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests universal screening compared with risk factor-based screening leads to more women being diagnosed with GDM. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests no clear differences between primary care and secondary care screening, for outcomes: GDM, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, caesarean birth, large-for-gestational age, neonatal complications composite, and hypoglycaemia. Further, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the value of screening for GDM, which may compare different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening (based on different risk profiles and settings), with the absence of screening, or with other protocols, guidelines or programmes. There is a need for future trials to be sufficiently powered to detect important differences in short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, such as those important outcomes pre-specified in this review. As only a proportion of women will be diagnosed with GDM in these trials, large sample sizes may be required.

### Pregnancy as an opportunity to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus: FIGO best practice advice [^114ECxpQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes (GDM) impacts approximately 17 million pregnancies worldwide. Women with a history of GDM have an 8-10-fold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a 2-fold higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with women without prior GDM. Although it is possible to prevent and/or delay progression of GDM to type 2 diabetes, this is not widely undertaken. Considering the increasing global rates of type 2 diabetes and CVD in women, it is essential to utilize pregnancy as an opportunity to identify women at risk and initiate preventive intervention. This article reviews existing clinical guidelines for postpartum identification and management of women with previous GDM and identifies key recommendations for the prevention and/or delayed progression to type 2 diabetes for global clinical practice.

### Precision stratification of prognostic risk factors associated with outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^117S1zm9]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this systematic review is to identify prognostic factors among women and their offspring affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), focusing on endpoints of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) for women, and cardiometabolic profile for offspring.

Methods

This review included studies published in English language from January 1st, 1990, through September 30th, 2021, that focused on the above outcomes of interest with respect to sociodemographic factors, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics, traditional clinical traits, and 'omics biomarkers in the mothers and offspring during the perinatal/postpartum periods and across the lifecourse. Studies that did not report associations of prognostic factors with outcomes of interest among GDM-exposed women or children were excluded.

Results

Here, we identified 109 publications comprising 98 observational studies and 11 randomized-controlled trials. Findings indicate that GDM severity, maternal obesity, race/ethnicity, and unhealthy diet and physical activity levels predict T2D and CVD in women, and greater cardiometabolic risk in offspring. However, using the Diabetes Canada 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for studies, the level of evidence was low due to potential for confounding, reverse causation, and selection biases.

Conclusions

GDM pregnancies with greater severity, as well as those accompanied by maternal obesity, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity, as well as cases that occur among women who identify as racial/ethnic minorities are associated with worse cardiometabolic prognosis in mothers and offspring. However, given the low quality of evidence, prospective studies with detailed covariate data collection and high fidelity of follow-up are warranted.

### Associations of gestational diabetes mellitus with the risk of cardiometabolic diseases: results from NHANES and mendelian randomization analyses [^111NPxjT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy according to The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG). The development of GDM was associated with mechanisms including the exacerbation of insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. With the prevalence of obesity and the growing number of older pregnant women, the incidence of GDM has increased dramatically, ranging from 7% to 10% in Europe and the United States. Increasing evidence suggests that GDM was associated not only with poor obstetric outcomes including caesarean section and macrosomia, but also with an increased risk of long-term health issues. Previous studies have shown that women with a history of GDM had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

However, there is some room for improvement of previous studies. Firstly, although cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are often intertwined, few studies have investigated the potential mediating role of chronic metabolic diseases in the association between a history of GDM and CVD risk, and the available evidence is inconsistent. Two studies have reported that GDM was associated with an increased risk of CVD independent of T2DM, but another two studies have yielded the opposite conclusion. In addition, it is worth noting that the effects of β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance may persist although GDM resolves postpartum. A retrospective cohort study reported a higher incidence of T2DM and hypertension in younger women with GDM. This suggests that earlier GDM onset may extend exposure to detrimental metabolic states, potentially accelerating cardiometabolic decline and elevating disease risk. However, it remains unclear whether younger age at GDM diagnosis independently predicts higher cardiometabolic morbidity. Thirdly, the current literature is limited to observational studies, which are susceptible to confounding factors and reverse causality, and it is difficult to predict the causal relationship between GDM history and cardiometabolic diseases. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies employ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess causality between exposure and outcome, which is a feasible alternative to randomized controlled trials. Liang et al. used a single-sample MR analysis to assess the causal association between GDM and CVD, however, only 4 cardiometabolic diseases were considered in that study.

### Age at menarche and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a population-based study in xiamen, China [^114pspGd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications, affecting 9.3–19.7% of all pregnancies in China. With the increasing prevalence of GDM and given the strong link between GDM and type 2 diabetes, the identification of women who are at high risk of GDM has important public health and clinical significance. Menarche is an indicator of pubertal onset and the beginning of reproductive life in women. Studies have demonstrated an association between an earlier age at menarche and elevated fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, and the risk for type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, all cause or cardiovascular disease mortality, and breast cancer. The precise mechanism by which early age at menarche may increase the risk of GDM is not clear. Some studies indicated that the early age at menarche was a risk factor of GDM. Additionally, Early age at menarche has been associated with risk factors for GDM such as excessive pre-pregnancy obesity, insulin resistance, and hormonal changes. However, the potential relationship of age at menarche and the risk of GDM have been inconclusive. Some studies founded a potential association, whereas others show no association. In this study, we examined whether there was an independent association between age at menarche and GDM risk, or with raised pregnancy glucose concentrations, in Chinese women.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus [^114fXNH9]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Hyperglycaemia that develops during pregnancy and resolves after birth has been recognized for over 50 years, but uniform worldwide consensus is lacking about threshold hyperglycaemic levels that merit a diagnosis of 'gestational diabetes mellitus' (GDM) and thus treatment during pregnancy. GDM is currently the most common medical complication of pregnancy, and prevalence of undiagnosed hyperglycaemia and even overt diabetes in young women is increasing. Maternal overweight and obesity, later age at childbearing, previous history of GDM, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and ethnicity are major GDM risk factors. Diagnosis is usually performed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), although a non-fasting, glucose challenge test (GCT) is used in some parts of the world to screen women for those requiring a full OGTT. Dietary modification and increased physical activity are the primary treatments for GDM, but pharmacotherapy, usually insulin, is used when normoglycaemia is not achieved. Oral hypoglycaemic agents, principally metformin and glibenclamide (glyburide), are also used in some countries. Treatment improves immediate pregnancy outcomes, reducing excess fetal growth and adiposity and pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders. GDM increases the risk of long-term complications, including obesity, impaired glucose metabolism and cardiovascular disease, in both the mother and infant. Optimal management of mother and infant during long-term follow-up remains challenging, with very limited implementation of preventive strategies in most parts of the world.

### Association of lactation with maternal risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^113ivGru]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the association between lactation and maternal risk of type 2 diabetes, including a potential graded association according to lactation duration.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that investigated the reported association between lactation (irrespective of duration, intensity or mode) and maternal risk of type 2 diabetes was conducted.

Results

A total of 22 studies (17 cohort studies and five cross-sectional studies) were included in this systematic review, and 16 contributed to the meta-analysis. Studies that investigated the association of lactation with risk of type 2 diabetes in the first months after birth in women with gestational diabetes reported conflicting results. Studies with a longer follow-up showed a graded protective association for lactation and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a potentially larger risk reduction in women with gestational diabetes than in those without gestational diabetes. Overall, ever versus never lactation was associated with a 27% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.73, 95% CI [0.65, 0.83]). Each additional month of lactation was associated with a 1% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.99, 95% CI [0.98, 0.99]). However, the overall quality of the studies was modest.

Conclusions

Lactation is associated with a significantly reduced risk of maternal type 2 diabetes over the life course, particularly in women with gestational diabetes. The protective effect seems to increase with longer duration of lactation. Further research is warranted to understand whether this association is modified by exposure to other risk factors.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^116Ne44g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Preeclampsia risk by maternal age — observational and meta-analytic findings: Pregnant women aged 35 years or older have been found to be at increased risk for preeclampsia in several observational cohort studies, and the risk seems linear, with increasing age at the time of pregnancy leading to increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; one large meta-analysis found that the risk for preeclampsia progressively increased with increasing age, with the difference statistically significant only in women aged 40 years and older, and the increased risk remained even when controlling for preexisting conditions independently associated with preeclampsia such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Even when using the older referent group, there was an increase in preeclampsia with advancing age older than 40 years in the pregnant women, with the RR for preeclampsia increased by 30% for women aged 40 to 44 years (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.25–1.4) and more than doubled for pregnant women aged 45 to 59 years (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.89–2.58).

### Differing risk factors for new onset and recurrent gestational diabetes mellitus in multipara women: a cohort study [^113fivQt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we found that the risk of GDM in subsequent pregnancy in women with a history GDM was three times as high as that in women without history of GDM. Furthermore, there was significant difference in the risk factors for newly diagnosed GDM and recurrent GDM.

Our study confirmed previous observations that women with a history of GDM are at increased risk for recurrent GDM in a subsequent pregnancy. A meta-analysis by Schwartz et al. found a pooled GDM recurrence rate of 48%, which is similar to our finding. It has been observed that the recurrence rate of GDM is highly variable across different ethnic groups. Previously reported GDM recurrence rates have varied widely from 30 to 84%, depending on the ethnicity of the study subjects. Studies on GDM recurrence in Asian populations are limited. A recent study in Korea women found that GDM recurred in approximately half of women with prior GDM. Few studies are available regarding GDM recurrence in Chinese women, largely due to the long-term one-child policy in China. A study by Wang et al. reported that the frequency of recurrent GDM was 55%, which was approximately the sum of the prevalence of recurrent GDM and PGDM in our study. Since the abolition of the one-child policy in 2016, there has been a significant increase in children born to mothers at an advanced age, drawing the attention to elevated incidence of gestational complications.

In our cohort, the risk factors associated with newly diagnosed GDM were significantly different from those associated with recurrent GDM. In multipara women without prior GDM, various risk factors were identified to be associated with GDM in the subsequent pregnancy, including advanced maternal age, higher PPBMI, increased interval between the two pregnancies, family history of T2DM, maternal low birth weight and higher early pregnancy metabolic factors such as blood glucose level and blood lipid levels. These identified risk factors for GDM are similar to those shown in previous studies of new onset GDM. In contrast, recurrent GDM was associated with relatively few risk factors.

It is notable that several seemingly important risk factors were identified only in the new onset GDM group, but not in the recurrent GDM group, including advanced maternal age, family history of T2DM, excessive gestational weight gain in early pregnancy and increased lipid profile. One plausible cause for this observed difference is that a GDM history pe se in women with recurrent GDM may represent an integrative outcome of a dysregulated lipid metabolism and other risk factors, which may have already encompassed these risk factors.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116jEbsQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes in pregnancy — The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy has been increasing in the U.S. in parallel with the worldwide epidemic of obesity, with increases in type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and reported rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in individuals of reproductive age. Diabetes confers significantly greater maternal and fetal risk that is largely related to the degree of hyperglycemia and to chronic complications and comorbidities of diabetes, with specific risks including spontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies, preeclampsia, fetal demise, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Exposure to hyperglycemia in utero increases the risks of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in offspring later in life.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus and predicted risk of maternal cardiovascular disease 10–14 years after delivery: a prospective cohort [^117YMtbq]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are two of the most frequent adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). The incidence of both HDP and GDM are increasing and each affects nearly 1 in 8 pregnant individuals in the United States, with a global incidence approaching 1 in 6 in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Both HDP and GDM are associated with over a twofold increased risk of cardiometabolic risk factors after delivery, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, as well as incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) across the lifespan, including coronary artery disease and stroke. The rate of cardiometabolic risk factors is increasing among female individuals of reproductive age. ASCVD remains the primary cause of death for women in the United States and globally. Sex disparities in ASCVD prevention, care and outcomes are well‐documented.

Over 80% of ASCVD can be prevented. The risk of developing ASCVD can be assessed in clinical practice using validated risk algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score. Such risk algorithms include well‐understood cardiometabolic risk factors that increase the risk of ASCVD after HDP and GDM, including age, obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, tobacco use and measures of dyslipidemia. While newer ASCVD risk prediction models continue to be developed, the Framingham Risk Score has been validated among female individuals across regional settings in the United States, Europe and Asia, as well as racial and ethnic subgroups. In recognition of the impact of HDP and GDM on cardiovascular health (CVH), professional society recommendations emphasize HDP and GDM as risk‐enhancing factors for ASCVD and consequently the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors after both APOs.

Quantifying differences in ASCVD risk in the postpartum period associated with pregnancy‐specific predictors such as HDP and GDM has not been adequately explored. Retrospective studies, for example, have examined the relationship between APOs and ASCVD events. Data from well‐characterized international prospective cohorts evaluating the relationship between HDP and GDM using consistent diagnostic criteria and estimated ASCVD risk could assist with patient‐centred clinical decision‐making and prioritize women's heart heath and prevention decades before ASCVD events occur.

The objective of the current analysis was to determine whether HDP and GDM are associated with a higher 10‐ and 30‐year predicted risk of ASCVD as quantified by the Framingham Risk Score 10–14 years after delivery. We hypothesized that having either HDP or GDM would be associated with a higher predicted ASCVD risk 10–14 years after delivery.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Significance of diabetes in pregnancy and long‐term risks

Globally, it is estimated that around 537 million people are currently living with diabetes, with projections expected to increase to more than 643 million people by 2030. Pregnancy is associated with multiple structural and functional changes and can be viewed as a biological "stress test" for various maternal organ systems. Growing evidence suggests that pregnancy complications are markers and accelerators of maladaptive maternal physiology, especially for the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, characterized by hyperglycemia first recognized during pregnancy that usually resolves immediately postpartum, but still carries long‐term risks.GDM impacts approximately 13.4% (around 17.0 million) of pregnancies worldwide, with both mother and infant at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other health complications later in life (Table 1).,

TABLE 1
Long‐term complications of gestational diabetes

Women with a history of GDM have an 8–10‐fold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with women without a history of GDM, which is highest 3–6 years after a GDM pregnancy. In addition to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, a small percentage (0%–9.45%) of women with a history of GDM develop type 1 diabetes postpartum. Furthermore, women who miss their postnatal follow‐up are also at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). A recent meta‐analysis involving over 5 million women showed that women with a history of GDM have a 2‐fold higher risk of developing CVD compared with women without GDM. This highlights the urgent need for early and ongoing proactive surveillance and effective preventive strategies for type 2 diabetes and CVD.

### Progression to type 2 diabetes in women with a known history of gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t3V4q]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To estimate and compare progression rates to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and healthy controls.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline and Embase between January 2000 and December 2019, studies published in English and conducted on humans.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Observational studies investigating progression to T2DM. Inclusion criteria were postpartum follow-up for at least 12 months, incident physician based diagnosis of diabetes, T2DM reported as a separate outcome rather than combined with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and studies with both a group of patients with GDM and a control group.

Results

This meta-analysis of 20 studies assessed a total of 1 332 373 individuals (67 956 women with GDM and 1 264 417 controls). Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models, and heterogeneity was assessed by use of the I² statistic. The pooled relative risk for the incidence of T2DM between participants with GDM and controls was estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity between studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and, overall, studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias (P = 0.58 and P = 0.90). The overall relative risk for T2DM was almost 10 times higher in women with previous GDM than in healthy controls (9.51, 95% confidence interval 7.14 to 12.67, P < 0.001). In populations of women with previous GDM, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 16.46% (95% confidence interval 16.16% to 16.77%) in women of mixed ethnicity, 15.58% (13.30% to 17.86%) in a predominantly non-white population, and 9.91% (9.39% to 10.42%) in a white population. These differences were not statistically significant between subgroups (white v mixed populations, P = 0.26; white v non-white populations, P = 0.54). Meta-regression analyses showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with mean study age, body mass index, publication year, and length of follow-up.

Conclusions

Women with a history of GDM appear to have a nearly 10-fold higher risk of developing T2DM than those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of intervening to prevent the onset of T2DM, particularly in the early years after pregnancy.

### Identifying women with gestational diabetes based on maternal characteristics: an analysis of four Norwegian prospective studies [^113Cs268]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple studies have evaluated selective risk factor-based strategies aiming to identify the best diagnostic approach for GDM. We demonstrate that the most sensitive and specific cut-offs for maternal age and BMI in European women were age ≥ 25 years and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² when parity was added. However, used as a screening strategy this would mean inviting the majority of women for an OGTT as at least one of these risk factors applies to most women today. This confirms recent findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis by Farrar et al. concluding that sensitivity increases with the number of women needing a test. This strategy does not vary much from universal screening, and supports the contention that identification of GDM requires testing of almost all pregnant women especially considering the rise in maternal age and overweight/obesity among childbearing over recent years.

Selective screening has the potential to spare many pregnant women of diagnostic testing thereby reducing time and resource use. However, consistent with others we found that screening on the basis of risk factors would result in a larger number of missed diagnoses and hence limit the opportunity for immediate and long-term follow up and treatment. This is of concern, as a substantial proportion of women with GDM have no defined risk factors. The importance of GDM management is now widely accepted, and evidence supports that treatment of even milder degrees of hyperglycaemia could improve pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, universal screening has the unique potential to identify this subset of women who would not otherwise be identified as having GDM, and, therefore, provide clinicians, as well as the women themselves, an opportunity to plan postpartum lifestyle interventions that could prevent or delay the onset of future type 2 diabetes.

Our study has several strengths. We merged data from four contemporary birth cohorts, allowing more powerful and flexible analyses. Additionally, although the level of missing was generally low, missing data were adequately handled by multiple imputation to prevent biased results. By including different geographical populations in Norway, we believe that the results may be broadly generalizable in Norway as well as to different antenatal populations in other high-income countries. Moreover, our study included women from various ethnic groups, making our findings relevant to other European countries with similar immigrant populations. It is of note, however, that almost all non-European women came from one study and more than half were of Asian (mainly South Asian) origin. Nevertheless, the proportion included and the composition of this group, is representative for the pregnant population with non-European ethnicity living in Norway.

### Prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in the born in guangzhou cohort study, China [^111ih4ib]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess potential risk factors in identifying women at risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Methods

The present study included data collected as part of a prospective cohort study, and included women with singleton pregnancies who underwent initial prenatal examination at a tertiary women and children's hospital in Guangzhou, China between February 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. Maternal characteristics and medical history were investigated to evaluate associations with GDM. A risk factor scoring system for the prediction of GDM was generated using logistic regression.

Results

Overall, 1129 (13.5%) of 8381 women were diagnosed with GDM. Women older than 35 years had a 3.95-fold increased risk of GDM (95% confidence interval 2.80–5.58) compared with women aged 16–25 years; obese women had a 6.54-fold higher risk (95% confidence interval 3.50–12.23) compared with underweight women. A risk scoring system was established based on age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, weight gain, and history of GDM. Screening for women with a score of 12 or more would have reduced the number undergoing oral glucose tolerance testing by 2131 (25.4%) patients with a sensitivity of 87% for GDM detection.

Conclusion

The assessment of risk factors for GDM could provide a foundation for improving risk-based screening strategies in this and similar populations.

### Gestational diabetes as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer: a prospective cohort study [^115RJJUf]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer of the pancreas is the fourth highest cause of death from cancer among women in the US. It is generally diagnosed at an advanced stage. Only a small proportion of tumors can be surgically resected, and many are resistant to chemotherapy or radiation. Thus, the lethality of pancreatic cancer is high, with the mortality rate (9.2/100000) approximating the incidence rate (9.5/100000) among women. Diabetes is well known to be associated with pancreatic cancer. There has been a long-standing debate, however, as to whether this is a consequence or an antecedent of the pancreatic tumor; evidence exists supporting both views. On the one hand, patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer frequently have type 2 diabetes mellitus of recent onset; removal of the tumor often ameliorates its manifestations. On the other hand, individuals with long-standing diabetes have also been shown to be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

During pregnancy, women become progressively more insulin resistant as a result of weight gain and release of placental hormones. While most women are able to compensate with increased secretion of insulin and experience only minor changes in plasma glucose levels, those with gestational diabetes mellitus are unable to compensate for the increased resistance and become hyperglycemic. Risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus include older age, family history of diabetes and high body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity. In the US, the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is approximately 7%, though it varies by ethnic group. It is more common among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans than among non-Hispanic Whites. Short-term consequences include fetal macrosomia and other neonatal morbidities; long term sequelae place the mother and offspring at increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A few investigators have studied gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational glucose intolerance as risk factors for breast cancer and other cancers but none, to our knowledge, have investigated gestational diabetes mellitus in relation to pancreatic cancer.

### Pre-pregnancy health of women with pre-existing diabetes or previous gestational diabetes: analysis of pregnancy risk factors and behavioural data from a digital tool [^116vYWKE]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In line with the rising global prevalence of diabetes, the number of pregnancies complicated by pre‐existing type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and by gestational diabetes mellitus is increasing in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

Women with diabetes in pregnancy are at greater risk of maternal and neonatal complications compared to those without diabetes. A recent population‐based cohort study of 17,375 pregnancies between 2014 and 2018 among women with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes in England and Wales reported high rates of preterm birth, and of infants born large for gestational age. Higher than average perinatal deaths, particularly in women with type 2 diabetes, who now account for more than 50% of pregnancies complicated by pre‐existing diabetes, were also reported. The obstetric and neonatal complications associated with gestational diabetesinclude large for gestational age infants, complications in labour and delivery and neonatal hypoglycaemia, as well as long‐term implications for both mother and child.

The importance of pre‐pregnancy care is underpinned by the potential to improve already established suboptimal health behaviours and risk factors for pregnancy complications before a woman conceives. We previously reported that UK women in general are not adequately prepared for pregnancy, with suboptimal health behaviours including smoking, lack of folic acid supplementation, alcohol consumption, low levels of physical activity and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake.

Planning for pregnancy through tailored pre‐pregnancy care, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, is particularly important for women who have pre‐existing diabetes, to minimise risk before conception. Optimising glycaemic management and appropriate medication use, for example, stopping potentially teratogenic medication and commencing higher dose (e.g. 5 mg) folic acid, among other preparatory actions, is known to improve pregnancy outcomes in this high‐risk group. In contrast, for women who have experienced a previous pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes, there are no preconception‐specific guidelines, only postpartum recommendations for diagnostic testing for diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk reduction. This is despite the well‐recognised risk of gestational diabetes recurring in a subsequent pregnancy.

Data on health behaviours in women with pre‐existing diabetes are limited and to the best of our knowledge, there are no such data in women with previous gestational diabetes. The aim of this study was to examine pre‐pregnancy health behaviours and pregnancy risk factors in women with pre‐existing diabetes or previous gestational diabetes, who completed a questionnaire incorporated into a digital pregnancy planning advisory tool. An additional aim was to document the reach of such a digital tool among high‐risk women.

### A clinical update on gestational diabetes mellitus [^112vdUrT]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Long-term Risk in the Offspring

Recent epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of later adverse cardiometabolic sequelae in the offspring of women with GDM. A large Danish population-based cohort study (n = 2 432 000) demonstrated an association between maternal diabetes and an increased rate of early onset cardiovascular disease (CVD; ≤ 40 years of age) among offspring. GDM specifically was associated with a 19% increased risk of early onset CVD (95% CI 1.07–1.32). A longitudinal UK study provides potential mechanistic insight, finding that GDM was associated with alterations in fetal cardiac function and structure, with reduced systolic and diastolic ventricular function persisting in infancy. This is consistent with the association between in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia and fetal programming first reported in the Native American Pima population, characterized by a high prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and GDM.

The recent HAPO Follow Up Study (HAPO-FUS), which was not confounded by treatment of maternal glycemia, included 4832 children 10 to 14 years of age whose mothers were participants of HAPO. The HAPO-FUS demonstrated a durable impact of maternal glycemia with long-term offspring glucose metabolism, including at glucose levels lower than those diagnostic for GDM. A generally linear relationship between maternal antenatal glucose and offspring glucose levels and related outcomes was observed. Increasing maternal glucose categories were associated with a higher risk of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance and higher timed glucose measures and HbA1c levels and were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity and disposition index by 14 years of age, independent of maternal and childhood BMI and family history of diabetes. A positive association was observed between GDM defined by any criteria and glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance in the offspring at ages 10 to 14 years and an inverse association with offspring insulin sensitivity. Higher frequencies of childhood obesity and measures of adiposity across increasing categories of maternal OGTT glucose levels were also noted. Recent evidence for increased glucose-linked hypothalamic activation in offspring aged 7 to 11 years previously exposed to maternal obesity and GDM in utero, which predicted higher subsequent BMI, represents 1 possible mechanism for this increased childhood obesity risk.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 190: gestational diabetes mellitus [^114VtUYX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatment benefits — randomized trials and reviews show improved maternal and neonatal outcomes with treatment. In the 2005 Australian randomized trial of 1,000 women, treatment reduced preeclampsia (from 18% to 12%), large for gestational age (from 22% to 13%), and birth weight greater than 4,000 g (from 21% to 10%). A U.S. multicenter trial of 958 women with mild GDM found no difference in a primary composite outcome but observed lower frequency of large for gestational age, lower frequency of birth weight exceeding 4,000 g, and reduced neonatal fat mass, with significant reductions in cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, and hypertensive disorders in treated women; a U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review highlighted reduced risks of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and macrosomia. Treatment in these studies consisted of dietary counseling with specific nutritional approaches and exercise; based on this evidence, women in whom GDM is diagnosed should receive nutrition and exercise counseling, and when this fails to adequately control glucose levels, medications should be used for maternal and fetal benefit, and in both trials insulin, not oral agents, was used when medical nutrition treatment did not control glucose values.

### Interventions to prevent women from developing gestational diabetes mellitus: an overview of cochrane reviews [^112nebqJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, with approximately 15% of pregnant women affected worldwide, varying by country, ethnicity and diagnostic thresholds. There are associated short- and long-term health risks for women and their babies.

Objectives

We aimed to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of interventions for preventing GDM.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (6 August 2019) with key words 'gestational diabetes' OR 'GDM' to identify reviews pre-specifying GDM as an outcome. We included reviews of interventions in women who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy, irrespective of their GDM risk status. Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using ROBIS and GRADE tools. We assigned interventions to categories with graphic icons to classify the effectiveness of interventions as: clear evidence of benefit or harm (GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a confidence interval (CI) that did not cross the line of no effect); clear evidence of no effect or equivalence (GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a narrow CI crossing the line of no effect); possible benefit or harm (low-quality evidence with a CI that did not cross the line of no effect or GRADE moderate- or high-quality evidence with a wide CI); or unknown benefit or harm (GRADE low-quality evidence with a wide CI or very low-quality evidence).

Main Results

We included 11 Cochrane Reviews (71 trials, 23,154 women) with data on GDM. Nine additional reviews pre-specified GDM as an outcome, but did not identify GDM data in included trials. Ten of the 11 reviews were judged to be at low risk of bias and one review at unclear risk of bias. Interventions assessed included diet, exercise, a combination of diet and exercise, dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, and management of other health problems in pregnancy. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Diet Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of dietary advice versus standard care, on the risk of GDM: risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04; 5 trials; 1279 women; very low-quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of a low glycaemic index diet versus a moderate-high glycaemic index diet on the risk of GDM: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.31; 4 trials; 912 women; low-quality evidence. Exercise Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm for exercise interventions versus standard antenatal care on the risk of GDM: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.84; 3 trials; 826 women; low-quality evidence. Diet and exercise combined Possible benefit: combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy versus standard care possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 19 trials; 6633 women; moderate-quality evidence. Dietary supplements Clear evidence of no effect: omega-3 fatty acid supplementation versus none in pregnancy had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.26; 12 trials; 5235 women; high-quality evidence. Possible benefit: myo-inositol supplementation during pregnancy versus control possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64; 3 trials; 502 women; low-quality evidence. Possible benefit: vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or control in pregnancy possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 4 trials; 446 women; low-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of probiotic with dietary intervention versus placebo with dietary intervention (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 1 trial; 114 women; very low-quality evidence), or probiotic with dietary intervention versus control (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92; 1 trial; 111 women; very low-quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. There was unknown benefit or harm of vitamin D + calcium supplementation versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; 1 trial; 54 women; very low-quality evidence) or vitamin D + calcium + other minerals versus calcium + other minerals (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.73; 1 trial; 1298 women; very low-quality evidence) on the risk of GDM. Pharmaceutical Possible benefit: metformin versus placebo given to obese pregnant women possibly reduced the risk of GDM: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.19; 3 trials; 892 women; moderate-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm:eight small trials with low- to very low-quality evidence showed unknown benefit or harm for heparin, aspirin, leukocyte immunisation or IgG given to women with a previous stillbirth on the risk of GDM. Management of other health issues Clear evidence of no effect: universal versus risk based screening of pregnant women for thyroid dysfunction had no effect on the risk of GDM: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25; 1 trial; 4516 women; moderate-quality evidence. Unknown benefit or harm: there was unknown benefit or harm of using fractional exhaled nitrogen oxide versus a clinical algorithm to adjust asthma therapy on the risk of GDM: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.77; 1 trial; 210 women; low-quality evidence. There was unknown benefit or harm of pharmacist led multidisciplinary approach to management of maternal asthma versus standard care on the risk of GDM: RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.82; 1 trial; 58 women; low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

No interventions to prevent GDM in 11 systematic reviews were of clear benefit or harm. A combination of exercise and diet, supplementation with myo-inositol, supplementation with vitamin D and metformin were of possible benefit in reducing the risk of GDM, but further high-quality evidence is needed. Omega-3-fatty acid supplementation and universal screening for thyroid dysfunction did not alter the risk of GDM. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to establish the effect on the risk of GDM of diet or exercise alone, probiotics, vitamin D with calcium or other vitamins and minerals, interventions in pregnancy after a previous stillbirth, and different asthma management strategies in pregnancy. There is a lack of trials investigating the effect of interventions prior to or between pregnancies on risk of GDM.

### Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus in the subsequent pregnancy: is it worthwhile? [^11645ABu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine, among women without evidence of gestational diabetes mellitus during their first pregnancy, the likelihood of, and associated risk factors for, the development of gestational diabetes mellitus in the subsequent pregnancy.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study, with a time frame of 1991 to 1999.

Results

Of 3710 women without gestational diabetes mellitus in the first pregnancy, 1% (37 women) were subsequently diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus in the second pregnancy. These 37 women, when compared (by means) to women without gestational diabetes mellitus in their second pregnancy, were more likely to be older (age 21 years vs 19 years) and obese (first visit body mass index, 28 kg/m² vs 25 kg/m²) and to have an interpregnancy weight gain of > 5 kg (93% vs 49%) and a longer mean interpregnancy interval (33 months vs 24 months). Regression analysis revealed that, during the first pregnancy, a first visit body mass index of > 29 kg/m² (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.5) and a serum glucose screen of > 101 mg/dL (odds ratio, 8.3; 95% CI, 2.5–27.9) were associated significantly with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus in the second pregnancy, as was an interpregnancy weight gain of > 5 kg (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 2.5–46.3). All women who subsequently had gestational diabetes mellitus had at least one of these risk factors.

Conclusion

Among women without gestational diabetes mellitus in the first pregnancy, the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in a second pregnancy is low. Therefore, screening all such women in the second pregnancy may not be justified.

### Animal models for clinical and gestational diabetes: maternal and fetal outcomes [^111zKMk7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease characterized by disarrangements in carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism caused by the complete or relative insufficiency of insulin secretion and/or insulin action. Diabetes in pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and remains a significant medical challenge. Diabetes during pregnancy may be divided into clinical diabetes (women previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes) and gestational diabetes, defined as any glucose intolerance detected during pregnancy that has evolved from a diagnosis associated with the metabolic risk of type 2 diabetes to a clinical condition associated with higher risks for maternal and perinatal morbidity. Fortunately, the prognosis has changed dramatically due to an increased clinical awareness of the potential risks for the mother and the infant.

Experimental models are developed with the purpose of enhancing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases that affect humans. With regard to diabetes in pregnancy, experimental findings from models will lead to the development of treatment strategies to maintain the closest to normal metabolic intrauterine milieu, improving perinatal development by preventing fetal growth restriction or macrosomia. The rat (and the rabbit) is often used in reproductive toxicity studies. In general, the uncontrolled human type 1 DM clinical status during pregnancy is reproduced by streptozotocin (STZ) administration (40 mg/kg) to rats during adult life using the venous route. In this experimental model, rats present with severe diabetes, with glycemia above 300 mg/dl, and the fetuses of dams are classified as small fetuses for gestational age, characterizing intrauterine growth restriction. Human type 2 DM and gestational DM conditions are reproduced in animals by administration of different doses of STZ in the neonatal period, before mating or during pregnancy. Adult animals present with glycemia between 120 and 300 mg/dl, characterizing moderate or mild diabetes. Merzouk and colleagues and Soulimane-Mokhtari and colleagues verified that mildly hyperglycemic dams have fetuses that are large for gestational age, classified as macrosomic.

### Pregnancy complications and risk of uterine rupture among women with singleton pregnancies in China [^114dkrV5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary analysis

Restricting to a group of women

To investigate the association between pregnancy complications and UR without potential maternal confounding factors (advanced maternal age and multiple gravidities), we performed sensitivity analyses excluding women with advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years) and/or multiple gravidities (≥ 4). Given the possible impacts of abnormal foetal presentation and macrosomia on the occurrence of UR, we restricted the association analysis to women with offspring having a cephalic lie and a birth weight of less than or equal to 4000 g.

Co-occurrence of pregnancy complications and UR risk

Pregnancy complications may co-occur in a given pregnancy. We therefore repeated model 1 and 2 testing for the associations between having at least two or more pregnancy complications and the risk of UR. Because the numbers were too small to assess unique combinations of pregnancy complications, we modelled the variables "no pregnancy complications", "any one pregnancy complication", and "any two or more pregnancy complications" in a single model.

Risk of UR in different gestational age groups

To explore the risk of UR with pregnancy complications in different gestational age groups, we compared the UR rates in women for each pregnancy complication and gestational age against those in women without pregnancy complications at 28–33 weeks of gestational age, using model 1 and 2.

Role of large for gestational age

Because LGA is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, we repeated model 1 and 2 testing to analyse a possible effect of LGA foetuses on the risk of UR among women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

Trends over time in UR rates

To examine trends over time in UR rates among women with pregnancy complications, we repeated model 1 and 2 by including the year of study period as a continuous variable.

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (version 16.0, Stata Corp LP. College Station, United States of America). P < 0.05 (2-sided) was considered statistically significant.

Patient involvement

Informed consent from the patients was waived by the Ethics Committee, as the data used in our study were obtained from a national routine surveillance system established by the government. Data use was authorized by the National Health Commission, and data provided to us were deidentified.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) — evidence-graded recommendations include the following. Based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A), "Women in whom GDM is diagnosed should receive nutrition and exercise counseling, and when this fails to adequately control glucose levels, medication should be used for maternal and fetal benefit", and "When pharmacologic treatment of GDM is indicated, insulin is considered the preferred treatment for diabetes in pregnancy". Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), "All pregnant women should be screened for GDM with a laboratory-based screening test(s) using blood glucose levels", "In women who decline insulin therapy or who the obstetricians or other obstetric care providers believe will be unable to safely administer insulin, or for women who cannot afford insulin, metformin is a reasonable alternative choice", "Glyburide treatment should not be recommended as a first-choice pharmacologic treatment because, in most studies, it does not yield equivalent outcomes to insulin", "Health care providers should counsel women of the limitations in safety data when prescribing oral agents to women with GDM", and "Women with GDM should be counseled regarding the risks and benefits of a scheduled cesarean delivery when the estimated fetal weight is 4,500 g or more".

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^114qfqmH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Obstetric Care Consensus — gestational diabetes interpregnancy care describes risk, screening, management, and goals. Women with gestational diabetes have a sevenfold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Interpregnancy testing is 2-hour OGTT at 4–12 weeks postpartum; screening every 1–3 years. Women with impaired fasting glucose, IGT, or diabetes should be referred for preventive or medical therapy. Goals are early detection of overt diabetes; diabetes prevention.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: update on screening, diagnosis, and… [^114FHnkM]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

3 GDM increases the risk of numerous obstetric complications, including operative delivery, hypertensive disorders, shoulder dystocia, fetal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age infants, neonatal hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress. Adequate glucose control reduces many of these risks. 3 Patients requiring only lifestyle changes to achieve euglycemia are designated as having A1GDM, whereas those requiring medications are designated as having A2GDM.
4. 2 reduces the risk of developing GDM. 5 Although prepregnancy weight loss appears to be effective, weight loss during pregnancy is not recommended due to the risk of small-for-gestational-age infants. 6 A Cochrane review of interventions during pregnancy concluded that receiving lifestyle advice and exercising can reduce the risk of GDM, but either intervention alone is not effective.

2 Retrospective studies show that patients with preexisting diabetes and early-onset GDM have higher rates of LGA infants, hypertensive disorders, cesarean delivery, and congenital malformations. 2, 16, 17 A recent prospective study of more than 40, 000 patients found that early screening and treatment of GDM in patients who are obese decrease the risk of LGA infants and cesarean delivery. 18 ACOG and the American Diabetes Association recommend considering screening high-risk patients early in pregnancy. 1, 4. Age 35 years or older BMI of 25 kg per m² or greater; consider performing early glucose screening for patients with this risk factor and one or more additional risk factor.

Fetal Surveillance The risk of stillbirth after 36 weeks of gestation is increased in patients with GDM to 17 per 10, 000 births, compared with 13 per 10, 000 births in patients without GDM. Postpartum Following delivery, maternal glucose levels typically return to prepregnancy values. However, the risk of developing overt diabetes within 25 years is 10 times higher in patients who have a history of GDM compared with those who do not.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus and development of intergenerational overall and subtypes of cardiovascular diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HdjR7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It is primarily diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy in women who do not have a pre-existing diabetic condition. It is a prevalent metabolic disorder, affecting approximately 1% to over 30% of pregnancies. In the year 2021, the American Heart Association (AHA) issued a statement underscoring the importance of considering adverse outcomes during pregnancy, such as hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, small-for-gestational-age delivery, pregnancy loss, and placental abruption, when evaluating the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in individuals with a history of pregnancy. Notably, the risk remains elevated up to 25 years after pregnancy, particularly in the window of 8 to 15 years after delivery.

Emerging evidence suggests that offspring born to pregnancies complicated by GDM are at elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disorders later in life. Exposure to GDM in utero has been linked to cardiovascular risks, including elevated levels of total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in offspring from mid-childhood to adolescence. However, data on the intergenerational impact of GDM on CVDs remains scarce, let alone a notable absence of a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining these impacts on overall and various subtypes of CVDs among mother-offspring pairs affected by GDM-complicated pregnancies.

Our review sought to explore the connections between GDM and the subsequent occurrence of overall CVDs as well as distinct types of CVDs in both mothers and offspring following childbirth. Specifically, considering that the existing body of literature primarily originates from Western populations, our objective is to evaluate the potential differences in outcomes for the Asian demographic. We put forth the hypothesis that women with a history of GDM and their offspring might be confronted with an elevated risk of CVD development. Due to the intimate interplay between maternal and offspring health throughout the pregnancy period, our findings could offer valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiology linking GDM and the emergence of intergenerational CVDs, and subsequently raise public awareness regarding postnatal care, particularly emphasizing early intervention, to enhance cardiovascular well-being for both mothers and offspring.

### Progression to type 2 diabetes in women with a known history of gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112tWqjN]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that women with a history of GDM are almost 10 times more likely to develop T2DM than those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy. The magnitude of this risk is consistent with evidence that the two conditions share common pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors, suggesting that GDM could potentially serve as a predictor for future development of T2DM.

Strengths and limitations

Among the strengths of this study are the substantial number of recently published studies, assessing a large total number of individuals, and with long term follow-up, ranging from one to 25 years. Guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up care for women with GDM have changed in a number of countries over the past decade, while the overall prevalence of T2DM has increased. This review provides up-to-date results in contemporary populations.

Nevertheless, this study had several limitations. Owing to limited resources, we had to exclude studies not published in English. Furthermore, owing to a lack of information on family history of diabetes or parity, we were not able to examine the potential effect of these factors on the incidence of T2DM. Additionally, while several primary studies adequately reported the ethnicity of study participants, others provided little or no information and had to be grouped using broad ethnic categories. Thus, we could not investigate progression in ethnic subgroups, which could have been a cause of heterogeneity between studies. The subsequent risk of T2DM in both women with previous GDM and healthy controls was estimated using relative risks, as person years of follow-up were not reported for every study. Thus we were not able to calculate incidence rate ratios consistently across studies. A further limitation was that although we assessed the cumulative incidence by study length of follow-up, it was difficult to reach conclusions about the timing of T2DM onset using study level data, as the cumulative incidence was known only at the end of the study and not when the events occurred. A more accurate assessment of cumulative incidence would require individual patient data, in a cohort where regular screening took place. In addition, the prespecified meta-regression analyses carried out to assess heterogeneity between studies lack power to identify associations between variables, as they are limited to the use of study level data. Overall, we were unable to identify the main sources of heterogeneity in our effect estimates, and a more in-depth analysis could have been performed if individual patient level data had been available.

### Potential protective effect of lactation against incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HBUFP]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the women with previous GDM lactating for more than 4 to 12 weeks postpartum have lower risk (moderate quality of evidence) of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with women with shorter lactation period. Also, women with GDM exclusively lactating for more than 6 to 9 weeks postpartum have lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with women with formula feeding. The etiology behind this potential long‐term beneficial effect of lactation remains poorly understood. The optimal support for women with GDM to breastfeed is not well studied. To investigate these unresolved issues between lactation and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, further studies are warranted in the future.

### Preconception care for diabetic women for improving maternal and infant health [^116k4wtn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Infants born to mothers with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of congenital anomalies, perinatal mortality and significant morbidity in the short and long term. Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes are at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and diabetic complications. The relationship between glycaemic control and health outcomes for both mothers and infants indicates the potential for preconception care for these women to be of benefit. This is an update of the original review, which was first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of preconception care in women with diabetes on health outcomes for mothers and their infants.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017) and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of preconception care for diabetic women. Cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We checked data for accuracy and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 254 adolescent girls with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with an overall unclear to high risk of bias. The three trials were conducted at diabetes clinics in the USA, and assessed the READY-Girls (Reproductive-health Education and Awareness of Diabetes in Youth for Girls) programme versus standard care. Considering primary outcomes, one trial reported no pregnancies in the trial period (12 months) (very low-quality evidence, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecision); in the other two trials, pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, or was not clearly reported on. None of the trials reported on the other primary maternal outcomes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and caesarean section; or primary infant outcomes, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, death or morbidity composite, or congenital malformations. Similarly, none of the trials reported on the secondary outcomes, for which we had planned to assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (maternal: induction of labour; perineal trauma; gestational weight gain; long-term cardiovascular health; infant: adiposity; type 1 or 2 diabetes; neurosensory disability). The majority of secondary maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services were not reported by the three included trials. Regarding behaviour changes associated with the intervention, in one trial, participants in the preconception care group had a slightly higher score for the actual initiation of discussion regarding preconception care with healthcare providers at follow-up (nine months), compared with those in the standard care group (mean difference 0.40, 95% confidence interval -0.02 to 0.82 (on a scale of 0 to 4 points); participants = 87) (a summation of four dichotomous items; possible range 0 to 4, with 0 being no discussion).

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient RCT data available to assess the effects of preconception care for diabetic women on health outcomes for mothers and their infants. More high-quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of different protocols of preconception care for diabetic women. Future trials should be powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services. We have identified three ongoing studies that we will consider in the next review update.

### Potential protective effect of lactation against incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F6Bbw]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

Lactation may protect women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the results of existing studies are inconsistent, ranging from null to beneficial. We aimed to conduct a systematic review to gather available evidence. Databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, and EMBASE were searched on December 15, 2015, without restriction of language or publication year. A manual search was also conducted. We included observational studies (cross‐sectional, case‐control, and cohort study) with information on lactation and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence among women with previous GDM. We excluded case studies without control data. Data synthesis was conducted by random‐effect meta‐analysis. Fourteen reports of 9 studies were included. Overall risk of bias using RoBANS ranged from low to unclear. Longer lactation for more than 4 to 12 weeks postpartum had risk reduction of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with shorter lactation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.01‐55.86; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35‐0.89; OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13‐0.36; type 2 diabetes mellitus evaluation time < 2 y, 2‐5 y, and > 5 y, respectively). Exclusive lactation for more than 6 to 9 weeks postpartum also had lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with exclusive formula (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22‐0.81). The findings support the evidence that longer and exclusive lactation may be beneficial for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention in women with previous GDM. However, the evidence relies only on observational studies. Therefore, further studies are required to address the true causal effect.
