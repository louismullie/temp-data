## Question

Management of pe with eliquis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing pulmonary embolism with apixaban (Eliquis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and immediate risk stratification. Then, I should verify indications and contraindications for apixaban. Next, I will determine the correct dosing strategy and whether parenteral bridging is needed. After that, I need to decide on the treatment setting and duration, including extended therapy. I will then review special populations and drug–drug interactions, outline monitoring and follow-up, and finally summarize a practical algorithm with key safety checks and shared decision-making points [^116wmKo1] [^111vohkk].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk-stratify, because management hinges on hemodynamic status and short-term risk. I should double-check that the patient is hemodynamically stable, using blood pressure and signs of shock as primary markers, and then apply validated tools such as PESI or sPESI to identify low-risk candidates for outpatient care; biomarkers like NT-proBNP or troponin and echocardiography help detect right ventricular strain in intermediate-risk patients, which would argue against early discharge despite low clinical scores [^113ad1do] [^114brC1S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anticoagulation choice before verifying indications and contraindications for apixaban. Apixaban is FDA-approved for treatment of PE and for reduction of recurrence risk, and major guidelines prefer DOACs over VKAs when eligible, but I need to check for absolute or relative contraindications such as active major bleeding, severe renal impairment, hepatic disease, thrombocytopenia, prosthetic heart valves, or triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome, where DOACs are not recommended; pregnancy and lactation also preclude DOAC use, so I should confirm these before proceeding [^114XMMtM] [^111vohkk] [^111cyaJx].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing strategy because apixaban has a unique front-loaded regimen. For acute treatment of PE, the labeled regimen is 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily, and importantly, no parenteral bridging is required with apixaban, which simplifies outpatient initiation; I should confirm that the patient understands the 7-day transition to avoid under- or overdosing after the first week [^111cJHZg] [^114kr3Ug] [^116Q9aRH].

> I need to ensure the treatment setting matches risk and supports safe adherence. For low-risk patients with adequate home support, outpatient management is appropriate and guideline-endorsed; for intermediate-risk patients, I should consider admission for observation and reassess for early discharge once stabilized; for high-risk PE with hypotension or shock, I should initiate UFH immediately and escalate to thrombolysis or embolectomy as indicated, rather than starting apixaban, because DOACs are not appropriate in the unstable setting [^114brC1S] [^113ad1do] [^116e6zPv] [^115uSEkd].

> Next, I should review duration of therapy and extended prevention, and I need to be careful not to conflate initial treatment with secondary prevention. The minimum duration for a first provoked PE is 3 months, and if the provoking factor resolves, stopping at 3 months is reasonable; for unprovoked PE or persistent risk factors, extending beyond 3 months is advised, and after at least 6 months of treatment, apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily reduces recurrence with low major bleeding risk in AMPLIFY-EXT; I should confirm that the patient understands the rationale for extended therapy and revisit bleeding risk annually [^116Mxmw6] [^112svMyJ] [^115PmE9L] [^116zNBYV].

> But wait, what if the patient has cancer-associated thrombosis or is on immunotherapy. I should double-check evolving guidance: while LMWH has long been standard, recent data and guidelines increasingly support DOACs, including apixaban, for cancer-associated VTE in selected patients without high bleeding risk or relevant drug interactions; in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, DOACs are acceptable for VTE management, with LMWH or VKA as alternatives based on bleeding and interaction risk, so I need to reconcile malignancy type, drug interactions, and bleeding risk before choosing apixaban [^113DzFX3] [^113AAESX] [^116fuqfx].

> I will now examine renal and hepatic impairment, because dose adjustments differ by indication. For PE treatment, no dose adjustment is recommended for renal impairment, including ESRD on dialysis, though evidence is limited and clinical vigilance is warranted; for hepatic impairment, apixaban is contraindicated in Child-Pugh C, and caution is advised in Child-Pugh B, so I should confirm liver function before prescribing and monitor closely if hepatic disease is present [^113BhS4e].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions and practical administration issues. Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers can materially alter apixaban exposure, so I need to review concomitant medications and either avoid interacting combinations or adjust the anticoagulant strategy; if a dose is missed, I should instruct the patient to take it as soon as possible the same day and resume the regular schedule without doubling, and I should counsel on adherence and bleeding precautions, including fall risk mitigation and alcohol moderation [^114kr3Ug] [^115ZzpfD].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up, even though routine coagulation monitoring is not required. I will plan a follow-up within the first week to confirm the 7-day dose transition, assess adherence and bleeding, and review labs if there are concerns about renal or hepatic function; at 3 months, I should reassess recurrence risk, bleeding risk, and whether to stop or extend therapy; if extended therapy is chosen, I should revisit the decision annually and consider dose reduction to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily in patients at higher bleeding risk while maintaining efficacy for recurrence prevention [^112fE6h5] [^116zNBYV] [^115ZzpfD].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that modify management. In triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome, DOACs are not recommended due to increased thrombotic events, so VKA therapy is preferred; in subsegmental PE without proximal DVT and low recurrence risk, surveillance may be reasonable, whereas anticoagulation is favored if recurrence risk is high; in pregnancy, DOACs are contraindicated and LMWH is the standard; and if neuraxial anesthesia or procedures are planned, I must adhere to strict timing rules around catheter manipulation and apixaban dosing to mitigate epidural hematoma risk [^111cyaJx] [^116woPLH] [^1167v5xu] [^117NM9aJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with evidence. For confirmed PE in a hemodynamically stable patient without contraindications, I will start apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily, and treat for at least 3 months; if the event was unprovoked or risk factors persist, I will discuss extended therapy and, after 6 months, offer apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for secondary prevention; throughout, I will screen for bleeding risk, review interactions, and use shared decision-making to individualize duration and dose, documenting the rationale at each step [^111cJHZg] [^112svMyJ] [^111vohkk] [^116zNBYV].

Eliquis (apixaban) is a first-line oral anticoagulant for pulmonary embolism (PE) [^111vohkk], offering **noninferior efficacy** [^111BKFsH] and **lower major bleeding** than warfarin [^111Vn74d]. Use **10 mg twice daily for 7 days**, then 5 mg twice daily for at least 3 months [^111cJHZg] [^116Mxmw6]; for unprovoked PE or persistent risk, extend to 6–12 months or indefinitely, and consider 2.5 mg twice daily after 6 months if bleeding risk is high [^112svMyJ] [^115ZzpfD]. No routine lab monitoring is needed [^115X5uii], but check renal function and drug interactions at baseline and periodically [^notfound]. Avoid in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min), active bleeding, or triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome [^111cyaJx]; use caution with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors or inducers [^notfound]. For bleeding, stop Eliquis and use andexanet alfa if available [^notfound]; for surgery, stop 1–2 days before (3–5 days if CrCl < 50 mL/min) and resume when hemostasis is secure [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting Eliquis use in PE

The AMPLIFY trial showed **noninferior efficacy** to enoxaparin/warfarin (recurrent VTE/VTE-related death 2.3% vs 2.7%) and **significantly lower major bleeding** (0.6% vs 1.8%) [^111Vn74d]. The AMPLIFY-EXT trial found that both 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily reduced recurrence versus placebo with low major bleeding [^111Vn74d].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Eliquis is appropriate for hemodynamically stable patients without contraindications; **outpatient management** is suitable for low-risk patients with adequate home support and follow-up [^117GajTd] [^114brC1S]. Contraindications include **active bleeding**, severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min), severe hepatic impairment, or triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome [^111cyaJx] [^111BKFsH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Routine coagulation monitoring is **not required** [^116iv3hn]; assess renal function and drug interactions at baseline and periodically [^115ZzpfD]. Follow-up should occur at 3 months to review bleeding, adherence, and recurrence risk and to decide on continued therapy [^112fE6h5].

---

## Management of bleeding complications

- **General measures**: Stop Eliquis, apply local pressure, and support hemodynamically [^notfound].
- **Specific antidote**: Andexanet alfa reverses factor Xa inhibition [^notfound].
- **Dialysis**: Not effective due to minimal protein binding [^notfound].

---

## Perioperative management

Stop Eliquis **1–2 days before surgery** (3–5 days if CrCl < 50 mL/min or high bleeding risk) and resume when hemostasis is secure [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Renal impairment**: Use caution; no dose adjustment for CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min; avoid if CrCl < 15 mL/min [^notfound].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Avoid in severe hepatic disease [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: No specific dose adjustment, but monitor closely for bleeding [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Not recommended; use LMWH instead [^117KVXC9].

---

## Drug interactions

Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) **increase apixaban levels** and bleeding risk; strong inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine) reduce efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Emphasize **adherence** to prevent recurrence and complications, and teach patients to recognize bleeding signs and when to seek care. Provide clear instructions on dosing, missed doses, and perioperative management [^114kr3Ug].

---

Eliquis is a **preferred option for PE** due to its efficacy, safety, and convenience, with straightforward dosing and no routine monitoring; careful patient selection, periodic renal/hepatic checks, and clear bleeding and perioperative plans optimize outcomes [^111vohkk] [^116wmKo1].

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^117UuKyb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Index VTE was classified as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), device-related thrombosis (neonatal population only), and other VTE (i.e. cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombus). Prior to randomization, patients could be treated with SOC anticoagulation for up to 14 days; overall mean (SD) duration of treatment with SOC anticoagulation prior to randomization was 4.9 (2.6) days, and for 92.9% of patients the duration was between 0 and 7 days. Patients were randomized according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either an age-appropriate formulation and body weight-adjusted doses of ELIQUIS or SOC. For patients 2 to less than 18 years, SOC was comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparins (UFH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA). For patients 28 days to less than 2 years of age, SOC was limited to heparins (UFH or LMWH). The main treatment phase lasted 6 to 12 weeks for patients aged birth to less than 2 years, and 12 weeks for patients aged greater than 2 years. Patients aged 28 days to less than 18 years who were randomized to receive apixaban had the option to continue apixaban treatment for 6 to 12 additional weeks in the extension phase.

A diagnostic imaging test was obtained at baseline, at week 6, and end of treatment for patients ≥ 2 years of age and at baseline and end of treatment for < 2 years of age.

Treatment

How long should I anticoagulate for? And with what dose?

Acute VTE/PE events should be treated for a minimum of 3 months. Physicians may consider stopping treatment at 3 months if the risk factor associated with the blood clot is no longer present. However, if the associated risk factor persists beyond 3 months, or if the blood clot occurred with no identifiable risk factors, physicians should consider treatment beyond 3 months, with the possibility of long-term anticoagulation.

Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in anticoagulation management with the majority of patients with acute PE being treated with a DOAC. A step-down dose in certain DOACs (apixaban and rivaroxaban) may be considered from 3 to 6 months after starting anticoagulation. Although patients were treated for a minimum of 6 months in randomised controlled trials of DOACs, in clinical practice, treatment can be reviewed between 3 and 6 months post-VTE.

Specific exceptions to the use of DOACs in acute PE include some patients with cancer such as gastrointestinal tract, renal system or brain malignancies or those receiving systemic cancer therapies with potential drug interactions. It is also recommended against initiating DOACs for the treatment or secondary prophylaxis in patients with venous thrombosis and known APS.

The European Respiratory Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to prefer a DOAC if oral anticoagulation is initiated in patients with PE being eligible for a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban).

### Managing pulmonary embolism from presentation to extended treatment [^114GhX1R]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major healthcare problem. PE presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms, and confirmation of diagnosis involves the use of clinical risk scores, scanning techniques and laboratory tests. Treatment choice is informed by the risk of sudden death, with high-risk patients recommended to receive thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. Patients with less severe presentations are given anticoagulant therapy, traditionally with parenteral heparins in the acute phase of treatment, transitioning to oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The limitations of these agents and the introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants challenge this paradigm. To date, clinical studies of four non-VKA oral anticoagulants to treat acute thrombosis have been published, and rivaroxaban is now approved for treatment and prevention of PE (and deep vein thrombosis). Rivaroxaban and apixaban alone, and dabigatran and edoxaban after parenteral anticoagulant induction, were non-inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism; the risk of major bleeding was similar with dabigatran and edoxaban and significantly reduced with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Patients with an initial PE are recommended to receive continued anticoagulation for 3 months or longer, depending on individual risk factors, and studies of non-VKA oral anticoagulants have shown a continued benefit for up to 2 years, without a significantly increased risk of major bleeding. Given that the non-VKA oral anticoagulants are given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, their adoption is likely to ease the burden on both PE patients and healthcare practitioners when longer-term or extended anticoagulation is warranted.

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^113GmmXp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with suspected PE, where a diagnosis has yet to be confirmed

Recommendation

Patients with suspected PE should, where reasonably practical, undergo investigation on the same day of presentation to exclude a diagnosis of PE. An alternative strategy of anticoagulation followed by outpatient imaging within 24 hours may be considered in patients with suspected PE, who have been deemed low risk and eligible for outpatient care as per confirmed PE. Robust systems should be in place to facilitate next day investigation and review. Grade D

Treatment of suspected/confirmed PE in the outpatient setting

(See tables 7 and 8).

Table 7
Key randomised trials of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)

Table 8
Relative risk of major and non-major bleeding using direct oral anticoagulants compared with Vitamin K antagonist

Recommendations

Patients with confirmed PE being treated in the outpatient setting should be offered treatment with either LMWH and dabigatran, LMWH and edoxaban or a single-drug regimen (apixaban or rivaroxaban). Grade A
Patients with suspected PE being treated in the outpatient setting may be treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban pending diagnosis as an alternative to LMWH. Grade D

Good practice point

Using a single DOAC in a pathway is preferred to minimise potential confusion over dosing and administration.

Assessing patients transitioning from inpatient care to early discharge/outpatient care?

Recommendation

Patients who have been admitted with an intermediate risk PE (PESI Class III) can be considered for early discharge when they meet the criteria for low risk (PESI class I/II or sPESI score 0). Grade C

Good practice points

Those with PESI-48 class III or sPESI-48 score of > 0 are considered to be at higher risk of adverse outcome and senior review is necessary prior to discharge; PESI and sPESI may remain elevated due to non-reversible factors (eg, cancer, age) which should be taken into consideration when using clinical judgement.
Consideration should be given to repeating assessment of right ventricular function with echocardiography or biomarkers in those admitted with right ventricular dysfunction or biomarker elevation at baseline.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^114XjNFQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease. In the US, an estimated 40–53 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with PE annually and approximately 60,000 die from the disease. Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are non-specific; however, a quick and accurate diagnosis is critical because, with appropriate therapy, the risk of recurrent (and potentially fatal) PE can be greatly reduced. Recent publication of prediction rules and improved non-invasive diagnostic tools have simplified diagnostic algorithms for PE. The efficacy of the standard treatment for PE, initial administration of continuous i.v. unfractionated heparin overlapped with long-term oral anticoagulation, is well established. However, newer treatment options such as low-molecular-weight heparins and the pentasaccharides may offer similar efficacy with improved convenience.

### Apixaban reduces hospitalizations in patients with venous thromboembolism: an analysis of the apixaban for the initial management of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis as first-line therapy (AMPLIFY) trial [^111Vn74d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death. 1, 2, 3 Of those patients who experience a first VTE, ≈20% present with sudden death secondary to pulmonary embolism (PE), ≈30% have died within 30 days, and ≈30% develop recurrent VTE within 10 years. 4 Additionally, ≈2% of patients with VTE treated with vitamin K antagonists experience major bleeding events within 3 months, of which up to 18% are fatal. 5

The standard regimen of anticoagulation treatment for VTE is complex and inconvenient, particularly in outpatient settings, as it involves overlapping a vitamin K antagonist with parenteral anticoagulants that require daily subcutaneous injections for ≥ 5 days. 6, 7, 8 Additionally, long‐term use of vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE is limited by concerns of bleeding, the narrow therapeutic window, and patient inconvenience due to the need for frequent international normalized ratio monitoring and numerous drug–drug and food interactions. 9

Apixaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses without the need for laboratory monitoring. 10, 11 The Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep‐Vein Thrombosis as First‐line Therapy (AMPLIFY; NCT00643201) trial showed that apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (enoxaparin/warfarin) for the primary efficacy outcome, recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE‐related death (2.3% versus 2.7%, respectively), and was associated with fewer major bleeding events (0.6% versus 1.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). 12 The Apixaban after the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep‐Vein Thrombosis with First‐Line Therapy–Extended Treatment (AMPLIFY‐EXT; NCT00633893) trial showed that compared with placebo, both the 2.5‐mg and the 5‐mg doses of apixaban reduced the risk of recurrent fatal or nonfatal VTE over 12 months, and that the rates of major bleeding were both low and comparable to those in the placebo group. 13 Our previous analysis of the AMPLIFY‐EXT trial showed that extended anticoagulation with apixaban reduced the risk of all‐cause hospitalizations compared with placebo in patients with VTE who had already received anticoagulant therapy for 6 to 12 months for their index event. 14

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^117KVXC9]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

In which patients should I consider early discharge?

Clinical severity scoring systems have more clearly identified patients at low risk of complications from acute PE who may not require hospitalisation. PESI is the most widely validated scoring system and has been utilised in prospective randomised management studies to demonstrate the safety of such an approach, which may be appropriate in up to 40% of patients. Outpatient management of PE generally requires LMWH administration during oral anticoagulant initiation, although the introduction of oral factor Xa inhibitors provides the possibility of a more convenient ambulatory treatment for patients. Safe early discharge of patients is dependent on a robust multidisciplinary approach involving rapid imaging, accurate assessment and adequate support and follow-up mechanisms for the discharged patient. Admission of patients at very low or low risk may still be advisable due to patient concern or ongoing pain. Repeat PESI scoring after 48 h in patients initially assessed as unsuitable for discharge may reclassify them as appropriate for outpatient anticoagulation.

Suggested approach: Patients with a very low or low PESI score may be offered early discharge and outpatient anticoagulation but a robust system of support and follow-up is mandatory.

What is the role of the newer oral agents in the management of acute PE?

At the time of writing, rivaroxaban, a direct Xa inhibitor, is the only new oral anticoagulant (NOAC) licensed and approved for the treatment and secondary prevention of DVT and PE in the UK. Other NOACs (dabigatran: a direct thrombin inhibitor; and apixaban and edoxaban: direct Xa inhibitors), however, have also been shown to be non-inferior to conventional anticoagulant therapy with favourable safety profiles in the treatment of patients with PE. In the dabigatran (RE-COVER)and edoxaban (HOKUSAI)studies, all patients initially received heparin for 10 and 7 days. The rivaroxaban (EINSTEIN-PE) and apixaban (AMPLIFY) studies excluded patients who had had more than 48 h of heparin, thus these therapies introduce the option of managing patients without parenteral anticoagulation. Patients with active malignancy were excluded from these studies (LMWH remains the standard of care for these patients), and NOACs should not be used in pregnant or lactating women, or in patients with significant renal impairment. Importantly, no regular monitoring is required.

Suggested approach: Other NOACs may also become licensed in the future but currently rivaroxaban can be considered an option for the acute management of haemodynamically stable patients with PE within its product license.

### Optimal follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society [^115ZzpfD]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of bleeding risk

From the start of anticoagulant treatment, patients with acute PE are at increased bleeding risk. Therefore, management of bleeding risk is relevant throughout the course of treatment, beginning with ruling out absolute contraindications to anticoagulant treatment at diagnosis, identifying the optimal anticoagulant strategy, and avoiding unnecessary interventions. Alternative treatment strategies in PE patients who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation include (repeated) platelet transfusions to deal with 'critical' thrombocytopenia aiming to keep the platelet count above 30–50 × 10⁹/L, or the use of a retrievable vena cava filter in selected cases. Appropriate action should be taken to ensure drug adherence and optimal dosing, while avoiding relevant drug-drug interactions. Risk factors for bleeding need to be screened for and — when modifiable — reversed before patients are discharged. The most relevant potentially modifiable risk factors are: renal insufficiency, liver disease, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, hypertension, and use of antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After the first 3–6 months, estimation of the risk of bleeding over the long term becomes relevant for patients at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), for whom indefinite treatment is considered. This bleeding risk can be estimated by either implicit judgement, weighing individual risk factors, or by risk prediction schemes. The currently available evidence supports the application of the American College of Chest Physicians bleeding risk tool or VTE-BLEED to identify patients at lowest risk of bleeding complications, in whom long-term anticoagulant treatment is likely safe. There is however no evidence supporting the avoidance of long-term anticoagulation in patients with a high estimated bleeding risk based on either of these risk stratification tools. Instead, such knowledge should be discussed with the patient and incorporated into a shared decision-making process regarding continuation or discontinuation of anticoagulation. Moreover, we propose a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for patients at higher risk of bleeding, in whom it is decided to continue treatment. Of note, according to the ESC PE guideline, a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended anticoagulation after the first 6 months should generally be considered.

Venous thromboembolism epidemiology and diagnostic approach in emergency medicine notes that undiagnosed, untreated patients are at risk for progressive disease and sudden death, and U.S. estimates range from 600,000 to 900,000 individuals per year (1 to 2 per 1,000), with upwards of 294,000 fatal pulmonary embolism cases annually accounting for up to 10% of all hospital deaths. In selected populations, VTE mortality has been reported as low as 2% and as high as 30%, primarily attributed to pulmonary embolism. Structured clinical prediction rules such as Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria, Wells criteria, revised Geneva score, and prognostic tools including Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and Hestia criteria provide adjuncts to gestalt clinical assessment, and studies have supported using a predefined posttest probability threshold of less than 2.0% to exclude the diagnosis of VTE. The anticoagulation landscape includes non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants with simple oral dosing and no need for routine laboratory monitoring, with approved examples including apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto).

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^112aVqbB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

Recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism

Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients with acute PE to reduce the risk of early death and recurrent symptomatic or fatal VTE. Patients with high‐risk PE should receive prompt intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to reperfusion 10. Guideline‐recommended options for anticoagulation in patients with confirmed non‐high‐risk PE include 10, 11:
A DOAC approved as a single‐drug therapy (apixaban or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation followed by a DOAC (e.g. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban)
Acute‐phase parenteral anticoagulation overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)
Parenteral anticoagulation alone

From a patient and health care provider prospective, some of the DOACs offer several practical advantages over VKAs, including the lack of requirements for bridging anticoagulant injections, coagulation monitoring, limited dietary restrictions, and fewer drug–drug interactions 30. By simplifying VTE treatment, DOACs make outpatient PE therapy more tolerable and feasible. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban, both approved as single‐drug therapies, facilitate initial outpatient PE treatment because they eliminate the need for parenteral anticoagulants (i.e. bridging therapy) 32, 33.

14.3 Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

Efficacy and safety of ELIQUIS for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment was derived from the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies. Both studies were randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trials in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE. All key safety and efficacy endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded manner by an independent committee.

AMPLIFY

The primary objective of AMPLIFY was to determine whether ELIQUIS was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin for the incidence of recurrent VTE (venous thromboembolism) or VTE-related death. Patients with an objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 10 mg twice daily orally for 7 days followed by ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR ≥ 2) followed by warfarin (target INR range 2.0–3.0) orally for 6 months. Patients who required thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent, and patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, significant liver disease, an existing heart valve or atrial fibrillation, or active bleeding were excluded from the AMPLIFY study. Patients were allowed to enter the study with or without prior parenteral anticoagulation (up to 48 hours).

### Risk-adapted management of pulmonary embolism [^1123RKfH]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

The presence and severity of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a key determinant of prognosis in the acute phase of pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk-adapted treatment strategies continue to evolve, tailoring initial management to the clinical presentation and the functional status of the RV. Beyond pharmacological and, if necessary, mechanical circulatory support, systemic thrombolysis remains the mainstay of treatment for hemodynamically unstable patients; in contrast, it is not routinely recommended for intermediate-risk PE. Catheter-directed pharmacomechanical reperfusion treatment represents a promising option for minimizing bleeding risk; for reduced-dose intravenous thrombolysis, the data are still preliminary. Non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants, directly inhibiting factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) or thrombin (dabigatran), have simplified initial and long-term anticoagulation for PE while reducing major bleeding risk. Use of vena cava filters should be restricted to selected patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, or PE recurrence despite adequately dosed anticoagulants.

A total of 5244 patients were evaluable for efficacy and were followed for a mean of 154 days in the ELIQUIS group and 152 days in the enoxaparin/warfarin group. The mean age was 57 years. The AMPLIFY study population was 59% male, 83% Caucasian, 8% Asian, and 4% Black. For patients randomized to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0–3.0) was 60.9%.

Approximately 90% of patients enrolled in AMPLIFY had an unprovoked DVT or PE at baseline. The remaining 10% of patients with a provoked DVT or PE were required to have an additional ongoing risk factor in order to be randomized, which included previous episode of DVT or PE, immobilization, history of cancer, active cancer, and known prothrombotic genotype.

ELIQUIS was shown to be noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the AMPLIFY study for the primary endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related death over 6 months of therapy (Table 17).

In the AMPLIFY study, patients were stratified according to their index event of PE (with or without DVT) or DVT (without PE). Efficacy in the initial treatment of VTE was consistent between the two subgroups.

2.3 ∣ Strategies to improve adoption of outpatient management

Several important barriers limit broad adoption of outpatient management for low-risk PE. However, these barriers can be directly addressed with specific strategies (Figure 1). For instance, despite the availability of these various risk scores/tools, clinicians frequently rely on their pre-existing heuristics, often developed during their medical training, when determining if hospital admission or outpatient management is appropriate. To remind clinicians to consider outpatient management when medically appropriate, clinical decision tools can be integrated into the electronic health record system. In 2 separate studies, this had significant impact on emergency medicine provider behavior, increasing the use of outpatient management for patients with low-risk PE in both cases.

In addition to reminding clinicians about eligibility for outpatient management of low-risk PE, a few other considerations are important before a patient can be safely discharged from the emergency department. These include appropriate selection of anticoagulant medications, reliable access to anticoagulant therapy, and rapid follow-up with a clinician. Almost all patients with acute PE can be safely treated using an oral-only strategy with either apixaban or rivaroxaban. However, there are rare patients with severe renal or liver impairment as well as those with triple-positive anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) may be better managed with an alternative anticoagulant (eg, vitamin K antagonist). Routine laboratory testing can easily identify those with renal or liver dysfunction, but testing for APS is not typically feasible in the emergency department and is generally discouraged in the acute setting due to a high false-positive rate. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be aware that the likelihood of APS is exceedingly low in patients with a first thrombotic episode and that the overwhelming majority of low-risk PE patients can be safely treated with DOAC therapy. If clinicians have a very high index of suspicion for APS (eg, patients presenting at a young age with an unprovoked VTE or arterial thrombosis, a history of recurrent pregnancy losses, and/or known systemic lupus erythematosus), they may elect to treat with the combination of heparin (or low-molecular-weight heparin) and a vitamin K antagonist.

TREATMENT

Patients with PE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as possible, barring contraindications. Options for initial anticoagulation include unfractionated heparin (UH) (e.g. 80 U/kg as an initial bolus followed by 18 U/kg/hour continuous infusion), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ BID) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. apixaban 10 mg PO BID or rivaroxaban 15 mg PO BID). There is growing evidence that UH is associated with delayed therapeutic anticoagulation.LMWH and DOACs are more likely than UH to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 h, with simpler dosing. Despite these benefits, UH is still used regularly.

The benefit of anticoagulation, and the choice of anticoagulant, must be considered alongside the risk of bleeding. As a class, DOACs are associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage than heparin and warfarin. While scores like HAS‐BLEDare useful in assessing bleeding risk associated with long‐term anticoagulation, there are no validated scores that assess short‐term bleeding risk and guide initial therapy. In general, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not remove the need for anticoagulation, but for patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, IVC filter placement may be considered. IVC filters are thrombogenic over time and should be removed as soon as clinically possible.

Advanced therapy is often indicated for haemodynamically unstable patients with PE, and some with RV dysfunction. Critically ill patients with PE are increasingly being evaluated by multidisciplinary PE response teams (PERTs)that facilitate rapid evaluation and treatment. Systemic thrombolysis is typically reserved for patients with haemodynamic instability that prevents alternative therapies. Catheter‐directed therapy (CDT), including thrombolysis or embolectomy, can be considered for high‐risk patients in lieu of systemic thrombolysis, or for patients for whom systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated. If available, patients with haemodynamic instability may be temporized with veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) prior to definitive treatment. However, evidence supporting CDT (Class 2a, Level C) and ECMO (Class 2b, Level C) is limited.

### Pulmonary embolism: risk assessment and management [^116FgqiE]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant burden on health and survival. Its severity ranges from asymptomatic, incidentally discovered subsegmental thrombi to massive, pressor-dependent PE complicated by cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. Rapid and accurate risk stratification is therefore of paramount importance to ensure the highest quality of care. This article critically reviews currently available and emerging tools for risk-stratifying acute PE, and particularly for distinguishing between elevated (intermediate) and low risk among normotensive patients. We focus on the potential value of risk assessment strategies for optimizing severity-adjusted management. Apart from reviewing the current evidence on advanced early therapy of acute PE (thrombolysis, surgery, catheter interventions, vena cava filters), we discuss recent advances in oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, and with new direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to profound changes in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism in the near future.

Acute pulmonary embolism stability and outpatient management — most patients are stable at presentation and low-risk cohorts have low adverse event rates with traditional anticoagulation. "More than 95% of patients who ultimately receive a diagnosis of acute PE are 'hemodynamically stable' at presentation with an associated mortality of 1% to 15%". "More recently, NOACs (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) have been approved for the treatment of both DVT and PE after studies demonstrated that this regimen was noninferior to traditional treatment with heparin and a VKA". "Two randomized controlled trials were identified that assessed outcomes of low-risk patients admitted to the hospital and treated with traditional anticoagulation for 90 days". "In these 2 studies, the incidence of recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality was approximately 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively". Accordingly, "an outpatient treatment strategy for newly diagnosed PE can be deemed safe and effective if the subsequent incidence of important adverse outcomes does not exceed those experienced by patients receiving traditional hospitalization followed by outpatient care".

2.3 Randomization and trial interventions

In a patient with ECOPD who requires hospital admission, randomization should occur in the first 24 hours after admission. The trial uses a computer‐generated randomization scheme. Randomization is stratified by center and, within the centers, performed in blocks of 4 and 6 to ensure balanced distribution of the management groups. Randomization is performed centrally through the Internet, and management allocation is concealed from all investigators.

2.3.1 Intervention group

Patients in the intervention group have blood samples collected from an antecubital vein, and undergo D‐dimer testing within 12 hours after randomization. Cutoff levels for defining elevated D‐dimer are defined by the Department of Clinical Chemistry at each participating site. For patients with a negative D‐dimer, a diagnosis of PE is ruled out. For patients with a positive D‐dimer, a contrast‐enhanced, PE‐protocol, multidetector computerized tomography (CTPA) is performed. CTPA results are categorized as positive for PE if an intraluminal filling defect is seen in (sub)segmental or more proximal branches, and are considered negative if no filling defect is observed. Scans are considered technically inadequate only if main or lobar pulmonary vessels are not visualized. Although not mandatory, the protocol suggests the use of complete lower limb compression ultrasonography (CCUS) to detect concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for patients with isolated subsegmental PE.

If the diagnosis of PE is confirmed, patients receive anticoagulant treatment according to guideline recommendations: parenteral anticoagulation (ie, unfractionated heparin, low‐molecular‐weight heparin, or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by vitamin K antagonists; or parenteral anticoagulation followed by dabigatran or edoxaban; or monotherapy with apixaban or rivaroxaban. 18

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Since no biomarkers and surrogate measures to refine cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with PE have been established, we propose to perform systematic cardiovascular risk assessment in all PE patients, using validated scores and risk calculators, and according to current guidelines. Patients with PE and a high cardiovascular risk score, especially in case of unprovoked PE and/or obesity, may require urgent attention to controlling risk factors. We propose that a holistic assessment of risk factors is performed at the routine 3-month follow-up visit, while individual risk factors such as smoking and hypertension should be targeted at the earliest convenience.

In PE patients with established cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular drugs may be discontinued or modified during the acute phase of treatment. This is particularly relevant for beta-blockers and antihypertensive drugs, the administration of which should be carefully re-evaluated in acute PE presenting with hypotension and/or severe RV dysfunction. Careful assessment of the expected benefits vs. risks of such drugs should guide management decisions in the individual patient. Similar anticoagulant strategies based on assessment of the risk of bleeding and ischaemic complications as in patients with atrial fibrillation can be followed. Triple therapy for longer than 1 week should be considered when risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk, with the total duration (< 1 month) decided according to assessment of these risks. Triple therapy may be considered for up to 6 months in selected patients with high ischaemic risk. The treatment plan should be clearly specified at hospital discharge, and this strategy should be re-evaluated at regular intervals during follow-up. i.e. with a short period of overlapping antiplatelet therapy after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting, to mitigate the risk of bleeding. For PE patients with established ischaemic cardiovascular disease, the full dose of anticoagulation should be continued for as long as indicated; a dose reduction in accordance with the label of rivaroxaban and apixaban after a treatment period of 6 months is not applicable in these patients.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^11588WDx]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is the third most common fatal cardiovascular condition in the United States. Clinical prediction rules such as the Wells' Criteria for DVT, Wells' Criteria for PE, and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria should be used to determine the pretest probability of DVT or PE. The D-dimer assay is used in low-risk patients to rule out DVT and in moderate-risk patients to rule out PE. Compression ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose DVT. PE typically is diagnosed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or with ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy if the patient has contraindications to computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. Preferred outpatient therapy for VTE is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant rather than a vitamin K antagonist or low-molecular-weight heparin. Most patients with acute uncomplicated DVT can be treated as outpatients. The Simplified PE Severity Index can guide treatment decisions for patients with PE. Apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used for initial management without the need to bridge with parenteral therapy. Treatment is recommended for 3 to 6 months after initial VTE. Patients with chronic risk factors, a recurrent VTE after primary treatment, or a first unprovoked VTE should be considered for secondary prevention with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant or warfarin after a bleeding-risk assessment.

Results

The clinical efficacy and safety results of the AMPLIFY trial have been published previously. 12 Briefly, a total of 5614 patients were enrolled at 358 centers in 28 countries; 5 patients (apixaban, n = 2; enoxaparin, n = 3) were excluded due to an absence of source documentation. The intention‐to‐treat population included 2691 patients assigned to apixaban and 2704 assigned to enoxaparin/warfarin. The safety population included 2676 patients assigned to apixaban and 2689 assigned to enoxaparin/warfarin. For the primary efficacy outcome, recurrent VTE, apixaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin (2.3% versus 2.7%; relative risk 0.84, 95% CI = 0.60–1.18, P < 0.001). 12 The rate of major bleeding, the primary safety outcome, was significantly reduced with apixaban compared with enoxaparin/warfarin (0.6% versus 1.8%; relative risk 0.31, 95% CI = 0.17–0.55, P < 0.001). 12

5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture

When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.

The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

No data are available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheters in pediatric patients while on ELIQUIS. In such cases, discontinue ELIQUIS and consider a short acting parenteral anticoagulant.

The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of ELIQUIS is not recommended in these patients.

5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy

Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including ELIQUIS, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

2.1 Recommended Dose in Adult Patients

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.
In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dose in Pediatric Patients

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE in Pediatric Patients

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is based on the patient's weight, see Table 1. Adjust the dose according to weight-tier as treatment progresses. Initiate ELIQUIS treatment for pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age following at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation therapy. Individualize duration of overall therapy after careful assessment of the treatment benefit and the risk for bleeding.

Table 1: Dose Recommendation in Pediatric Patients from Birth to less than 18 Years of Age for the Treatment of VTE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE

ELIQUIS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2.6 kg because ELIQUIS was not studied in these patients.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose of ELIQUIS is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^116wmKo1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

Methods

Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Current evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

Results

Management dilemmas discussed include: sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge and novel oral anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

AMPLIFY-EXT

Patients who had been treated for DVT and/or PE for 6 to 12 months with anticoagulant therapy without having a recurrent event were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 2.5 mg orally twice daily, ELIQUIS 5 mg orally twice daily, or placebo for 12 months. Approximately one-third of patients participated in the AMPLIFY study prior to enrollment in the AMPLIFY-EXT study.

A total of 2482 patients were randomized to study treatment and were followed for a mean of approximately 330 days in the ELIQUIS group and 312 days in the placebo group. The mean age in the AMPLIFY-EXT study was 57 years. The study population was 57% male, 85% Caucasian, 5% Asian, and 3% Black.

The AMPLIFY-EXT study enrolled patients with either an unprovoked DVT or PE at baseline (approximately 92%) or patients with a provoked baseline event and one additional risk factor for recurrence (approximately 8%). However, patients who had experienced multiple episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE were excluded from the AMPLIFY-EXT study. In the AMPLIFY-EXT study, both doses of ELIQUIS were superior to placebo in the primary endpoint of symptomatic, recurrent VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE), or all-cause death (Table 18).

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**

- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it's converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
- The indication for use includes four options: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), or Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis.

- **Computation**

- For **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**

- The dosage is tailored based on three criteria:

- Age of 80 years or older.
- Weight of 60 kg or less.
- Creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less.
- If a patient meets two or more of these criteria, the dosage is reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily. A note explains the reason for dosage reduction.
- If fewer than two criteria are met, the standard dosage is 5 mg twice daily.

- For **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** and **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**

- An initial higher dose of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days is recommended, followed by 5 mg twice daily. This regimen is aimed at acute treatment. A note provides context on the dosing strategy.

- For **Postoperative Thromboprophylaxis**

- The suggested dose is 2.5 mg twice daily, with a note indicating its purpose in preventing thrombosis after surgery.

- **Output**

- The calculator returns the determined apixaban dosage accompanied by relevant notes if applicable. These notes provide critical context for clinical decision-making, clarifying the reasoning behind dosage adjustments based on patient characteristics and treatment indications.

The structured assessment assures the apixaban dosage is well-suited to the patient's needs, adhering to clinical guidelines and ensuring safety and efficacy aligning with their health condition.

### Anticoagulation in pulmonary embolism: update in the age of direct oral anticoagulants [^1176xd7e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The emergence of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represents a major advancement and paradigm shift in the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Currently, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixiban, and edoxoban are approved and used routinely for the prevention and treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism. Because each of the DOACs has different doses and dosing regimens, clinicians need to become familiar with their use. This article focuses on the practical considerations of how and when to use the DOACs. It also aims to explore follow-up monitoring, use in special populations, reversal agents, periprocedural management, and how to handle bleeding complications with the DOACs.

### Editor's choice-efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III trials [^116TNLL4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim was to perform a review of the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. On March 26, 2014, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane trial register were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the NOAs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in VTE treatment and secondary prevention. Two investigators assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs. The main study outcomes (efficacy, safety and net clinical benefit) were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

Ten RCTs, mostly with low risk of bias, with nearly 38,000 patients, were identified. In six trials of treatment, NOAs were equally effective as VKAs in preventing recurrent symptomatic VTE (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75–1.05), but major bleeding occurred less often (1.08% vs. 1.73% for VKAs, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77), leading net clinical benefit to favor NOAs (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70–0.90). Fatal bleeding occurred less often with NOAs (0.09% vs. 0.18% for VKAs), a difference that approached statistical significance (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–1.01). In three secondary prevention trials, NOAs reduced VTE recurrence rates to 1.32% (vs. 7.24% with placebo, RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.24) and fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) (including unexplained deaths) to 0.1% (vs. 0.29% for placebo, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.10–1.38) at the expense of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (4.3% vs. 1.8% for placebo, RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.65–3.35), but not major bleeding. All-cause mortality rate was reduced to 0.41% with NOAs (vs. 0.86% with placebo, RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18–0.79). Net clinical benefit favored NOAs (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15–0.29), and NNT was 18.

Conclusions

Compared to VKAs, NOAs are not only effective in treating VTE but also safer in terms of bleeding, thereby conferring clinical benefit. Their safety and efficacy was confirmed further in secondary prevention trials.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^116zNBYV]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113xn5sB]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of ELIQUIS at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### JTH in clinic: management of low-risk pulmonary embolism [^115vwHrh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

1 ∣ INTRODUCTION

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cardiovascular disease after coronary artery disease and stroke. With an incidence between 300 000 and 600 000 in the United States and 39 to 115 per 100 000 individuals in Europe, PE is a global disease accounting for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. While strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, PE is not always life-threatening. In fact, the majority of PE patients who are hemodynamically stable at presentation have low risk for adverse outcomes. Risk prediction models, such as PE Severity Index (PESI), simplified PESI (sPESI), and Hestia criteria help clinicians stratify patients into appropriate risk groups. One important application of these risk scores is to identify patients in whom outpatient management may be safe. This approach is supported by robust clinical evidence and guideline recommendations from multiple professional organizations and clinical societies.

Indeed, there is a preponderance of evidence from multiple clinical trials to support safe outpatient management of acute PE. A recent Cochrane review of 2 trials found no differences between outpatient management and traditional hospitalization with regard to all-cause mortality at 7 to 10 days or 30 to 90 days as well as no difference in major or minor bleeding. Another systematic review included 12 studies (4 randomized and 8 nonrandomized trials) and showed low rates of all 90-day major adverse outcomes in low-risk PE patients managed at home, including < 1% all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and major bleeding.

Despite these robust safety data, widespread acceptance of risk assessment tools, and the weight of multiple guideline recommendations, adoption of outpatient management has been modest. A number of recent studies indicate that the vast majority of PE patients are still being hospitalized, even when they meet low-risk criteria, and prior efforts to promote outpatient management have produced less change than anticipated. The resulting hospitalizations are estimated to contribute more than $500 million to annual healthcare costs in the United States alone, while exposing patients to risks of hospital adverse events and conflicting with their preference to be treated at home. This is contrast to many other countries where outpatient management of acute PE is quite common.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^111gbGHN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing the number of patients with PE treated as outpatients could potentially reduce PE‐related hospital burdens. Avoidance of hospitalization, or early hospital discharge, reduces hospital length of stay (with associated cost savings) 30 and offers additional benefits, facilitating improved outcomes (e.g. eliminating/reducing the risk of hospital‐acquired infections) 31, potentially limiting the functional decline associated with hospitalization (typically observed in the elderly) 32, improving patient quality of life, and resulting in an earlier return to physical and professional activity 33. This non‐systematic narrative review aims to provide an overview of information that may be of help to physicians in selecting appropriate hemodynamically stable PE patient candidates for outpatient treatment. Current guideline recommendations will be discussed, along with a review of available evidence supporting outpatient treatment of PE with traditional anticoagulants and with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of acute pulmonary embolism [^114vtVGi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a subclass of venous thromboembolism, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification algorithms classify PE into high-risk (massive), intermediate-risk (submassive), and low-risk groups, with management guidelines determined based on clinical risk. For high-risk PE, first-line treatment options may include anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies, and surgical embolectomy. For intermediate-risk PE, management may involve anticoagulation and catheter-directed therapies, whereas for low-risk PE, management typically involves anticoagulation alone. Special case scenarios, such as a clinical contraindication to thrombolysis or right atrial thrombus-in-transit, may require a modified treatment approach. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

The intensity and timing of subsequent follow‐up appointments are influenced, at least partly, by treatment strategy. Patients treated with parenteral anticoagulants overlapping with and followed by a VKA will require daily/alternate‐day international normalized ratio (INR) testing until a therapeutic INR (2.0–3.0) is obtained (and parenteral anticoagulation can be stopped) and frequent INR testing thereafter. For patients initially treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for whom dabigatran or edoxaban is intended, we suggest scheduling a follow‐up appointment at the time of DOAC initiation (i.e. after ≥ 5 days treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant) 70, 71. Likewise, for patients discharged on a DOAC approved as a single‐drug therapy (i.e. apixaban and rivaroxaban), we advise that a follow‐up appointment at the time of dose change may be considered to avoid potential for dosing errors – the recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of VTE is 10 mg twice daily (bid) for the first seven days, followed by 5 mg bid thereafter; the recommended dose of rivaroxaban is 15 mg bid for three weeks followed by 20 mg once daily thereafter 72, 73. Patients with PE should be treated with anticoagulants for at least three months – a follow‐up appointment at three months provides an opportunity for review and assessment whether extended anticoagulation is indicated 10, 11.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114brC1S]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) outpatient management — selection criteria and recommendation: Patients suitable for treatment of acute PE out of the hospital should meet all of the following — clinically stable with good cardiopulmonary reserve; no contraindications such as recent bleeding, severe renal or liver disease, or severe thrombocytopenia (ie, < 70,000/mm3); expected to be compliant with treatment; and the patient feels well enough to be treated at home. Clinical decision rules such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), either the original form with score < 85 or the simplified form with score 0, can help identify low-risk candidates; however, prediction rules are aids and a predefined score is not required, and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction or increased cardiac biomarker levels should discourage treatment out of the hospital. The updated recommendation has been modified to state that appropriately selected patients may be treated entirely at home, rather than just be discharged early, and specifically states: "we suggest treatment at home or early discharge over standard discharge (eg, after the first 5 days of treatment) (Grade 2B)" in patients with low-risk PE whose home circumstances are adequate.

### Treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and / or pulmonary embolism: efficacy and safety of non-VKA oral anticoagulants in selected populations [^1175ec62]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), presents a large clinical burden. Prompt, effective and sustained anticoagulation is vital because of the risk of recurrent events, including life-threatening PE, and complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Dual-drug standard therapy is effective; however, parenteral low molecular weight heparin, coupled with routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), presents challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants provide a simplified option for VTE treatment. Phase III studies have investigated rivaroxaban and apixaban as single-drug approaches, and edoxaban and dabigatran in conjunction with initial heparin therapy. These agents demonstrated non-inferiority to standard therapy, and most showed significant reductions in major bleeding. However, clinical information is limited in patient subgroups, e.g. fragile patients or patients with renal impairment or cancer, who may be at higher risk of bleeding and/or VTE. A prespecified pooled analysis of the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies (8281 patients), undertaken to evaluate clinical outcomes with rivaroxaban versus standard therapy, confirmed the non-inferiority of rivaroxaban, with significant reductions in major bleeding and fewer intracranial and retroperitoneal bleeding events. Consistent efficacy and safety were observed with rivaroxaban, irrespective of fragility, cancer or clot severity. The introduction of the non-VKA oral anticoagulants and approval of rivaroxaban in the EU, US and Canada for the treatment and secondary prevention of DVT and PE offer the potential for improvements in effective care across a broad spectrum of patients with VTE.

### D-dimer and reduced-dose apixaban for extended treatment after unprovoked venous thromboembolism: the apidulcis study [^1136FRZk]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), tends to recur, especially in patients whose index event was unprovoked or associated with permanent prothrombotic conditions. Anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months is recommended in all patients with VTE, whereas indefinite anticoagulation is recommended in patients with unprovoked VTE without a high bleeding risksince recurrence after anticoagulation discontinuation does not depend on the duration of initial treatment. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies involving 7515 patients showed that the cumulative incidence of 10-year recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first unprovoked VTE was 36% (with a 95% confidence interval [CI] ranging from 28% to 45%). In a previous management study, we tried to stratify patients with unprovoked index events using a serial D-dimer assay. Patients with positive assay were found to be at an increased risk of recurrence and required resumption of anticoagulant treatment, whereas those with persistently negative assay were at low risk and could safely withhold anticoagulation. Of note, patients resuming vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the only oral anticoagulant drugs available at that time, experienced a high rate of bleeding events (2.4% patient-years). In recent years, 4 direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were licensed for VTE treatment. Furthermore, specifically designed studies have suggested that 2 of the DOACs (apixaban and rivaroxaban) are as effective and safe when administered at half their usual dose for extended treatment in patients with VTE who had already received a first-line therapy for 6 to 12 months.

The Apidulcis was a multicenter, prospective, management cohort study whose aim was to assess the value of an algorithm incorporating serial D-dimer with low-dose apixaban for the long-term management of patients with a first episode of proximal DVT and/or PE that was either unprovoked or associated with weak risk factors after completing an uneventful 12-month period of conventional anticoagulation.

### Inpatient versus outpatient acute venous thromboembolism management: trends and postacute healthcare utilization from 2011 to 2018 [^113w8nRe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which consists of both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), affects ≈1.1 million Americans annually. The landscape of VTE diagnosis and management has changed dramatically in the past 2 decades. In regard to acute out‐of‐hospital management, the 2016 American College of Chest Physicians Guideline and Expert Panel Report states that "In patients with low‐risk PE and whose home circumstances are adequate, we suggest at home or early discharge over standard discharge (eg, after the first 5 days of treatment)". This is a Grade 2B recommendation, signifying that it is a "weak" (Grade 2) recommendation based on "moderate" (Grade B) quality evidence. Given that patients with DVT events but no documented PE are at lower risk of adverse outcomes, outpatient management in this context has been widespread for some time.

Outpatient VTE treatment has the potential to reduce medical costs, be less burdensome to patients, and in low‐risk situations, yield similar outcomes. However, there are important barriers to outpatient management; most prominently, fear of experiencing early complications and whether a local healthcare system can provide adequate initial care in the outpatient setting. Little is known about how widely outpatient management is presently being utilized or its real‐world effectiveness.

Outpatient treatment rates may have increased in recent years because of both (1) primary treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offering an all‐oral VTE treatment option, and (2) improved identification of patients with low‐risk PE. The availability of several DOACs (ie, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), in addition to warfarin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin, have expanded the potential for outpatient VTE management. The DOACs have a more stable anticoagulant effect and require less monitoring. Additionally, some (ie, rivaroxaban and apixaban) do not require initial parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Emergency department discharge of pulmonary embolus patients [^113Afox5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Reflective of the changing anticoagulant landscape, the majority of patients enrolled in MERCURY‐PE received treatment with a DOAC, most commonly rivaroxaban (51%) or apixaban (25%). While both of these agents have a rapid onset, 75% of all patients still were initially treated with unfractionated or low‐molecular‐weight heparin. The use of a heparinoid agent, despite no bridging therapy requirement with DOACs, may reflect historical patterns of early treatment in suspected PE or may represent concern for selecting a reversible agent (heparin can be reversed, factor Xa inhibitors do not currently have an available antidote) in the initial management period.

Finally, we noted a higher frequency of TE‐AEs with rivaroxaban. This seem to be a composite of several subjective complaints, which in the final analysis did not result in study drug termination or an association with AEs. While the precise causality of these TE‐AEs cannot be determined and are not reflected in very large investigations of rivaroxaban, it is possible that our finding represents a nociceptive bias (where subjects report a higher frequency of events in randomized controlled trials compared to observational registries, as they are specifically asked about these events randomized controlled trials).

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^113AAESX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy — grade-specific management is as follows: For G2 venous thrombosis (eg, uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis), continue ICPi with management according to CHEST, ACC, and/or AHA guidelines, considering cardiology consult; use LMWH, VKA, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban for initial anticoagulation, and for long-term anticoagulation LMWH, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for at least 6 months are preferred over VKAs; IV heparin is an acceptable initial alternative and oral anticoagulants are acceptable long term. For G3 venous thrombosis (eg, uncomplicated pulmonary embolism [PE]), hold ICPi and may reintroduce after risk and benefit are considered, and follow G2 anticoagulation recommendations. For G4 ("Life-threatening consequences; hemodynamic or neurologic instability; organ damage; loss of extremity(ies)"), hold ICPi and may reintroduce after risk and benefit are considered; admit for management according to CHEST, ACC, and/or AHA guidelines with guidance from cardiology, provide respiratory and hemodynamic support, and follow G2 anticoagulation recommendations with symptom-based clinical management. Additional considerations state that VTE prophylaxis in high-risk outpatients with cancer (Khorana score of 2 or higher before a new systemic regimen) may be offered thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH if there are no significant bleeding risk factors or drug interactions; clinicians are to use clinical judgment when deciding whether to discontinue ICPi, removal of potential inciting agents is reasonable given the life‑threatening potential of grade 4 complications, and anticoagulation should continue during immunotherapy with consideration for an additional 6 months after completion.

### Treatment of pulmonary embolism with rivaroxaban: outcomes by simplified pulmonary embolism severity index score from a post hoc analysis of the EINSTEIN PE study [^113SYPH1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Acute PE is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires urgent intervention. In the United States, most patients with PE are admitted to the hospital, whereas patients with acute DVT are often managed as outpatients with coordinated care through a primary provider. Current standard therapy for most patients with acute PE or DVT is the same: anticoagulation therapy with a parenteral agent (e.g. subcutaneous administration of low-molecular-weight heparin) overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).

The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI are extensively validated prognostic tools for predicting death and adverse outcome events in patients with PE.–The simplified PESI score has proven useful to physicians and allows risk stratification of patients with PE. Patients found to be at low risk using this measure may be able to be discharged safely from the emergency department (ED). The standard dual-drug anticoagulation therapy is effective but complex. Non-VKA direct oral anticoagulants, given as fixed-dose regimens, have been shown to have similar efficacy and safety profiles to standard therapy in phase III studies. The advantage of these agents is their potential to improve patients' quality of life by simplifying patient management and offering the therapeutic flexibility of oral administration without the need for routine coagulation monitoring (a limitation of the VKAs). Results from the phase III EINSTEIN PE study showed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the efficacy endpoint of recurrent VTE and the safety outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Given the similar safety profile of rivaroxaban to enoxaparin/VKA therapy, the identification of a cohort of PE patients (e.g. those with low simplified PESI scores) with very few short-term (within 7 to 14 days) adverse events could support the consideration of direct discharge from the ED. Therefore, the results of this analysis provide a framework for an informed discussion with the patient regarding his or her prognosis and management pathway.

This post hoc analysis assessed adverse outcomes in relation to the simplified PESI score in patients with symptomatic PE who were treated with rivaroxaban or standard therapy in the phase III EINSTEIN PE study and evaluated the use of the simplified PESI score to identify low-risk patients with acute PE who could be considered for treatment with rivaroxaban or standard therapy out of the hospital setting.

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^114MfsbN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Finally, the advent of the DOACs facilitates early discharge from hospital since patients no longer need to be kept in hospital until they have reached a therapeutic INR. This raises the question of how to identify moderate-risk patients appropriate for early discharge.

In conclusion, there is a need for a standardised approach to identify low-risk patients for outpatient management and also to aid clinicians in deciding when moderate-risk patients can be discharged early. The aim of this guideline is to standardise the approach to the initial outpatient management of PE (up to 3 weeks post diagnosis) and to reduce the risk to patients and hospital trusts, while ensuring best value to the National Health Service.

Target audience for the guideline

This guideline is aimed at clinicians, in particular physicians, clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners, at all levels of seniority delivering emergency, acute, ambulatory and inpatient care who are involved in the management of acute PE. The main specialties referring to the guidance are likely to be acute, emergency, general (internal) and respiratory medicine. It is also designed to inform general practitioners involved in the delivery of ambulatory care or thrombosis pathways. This document may also be used by healthcare commissioners and hospital management to ensure appropriate staffing and resourcing of ambulatory care facilities to integrate PE management into ambulatory care pathways.

Scope of the guideline

The guideline covers
adults (≥ 16 years) with suspected and confirmed acute PE;
haemodynamically stable PE;
use of DOACs in relation to suspected PE and outpatient management;
risk stratification for identifying patients suitable for outpatient management or early discharge;
special subgroups of patients (pregnant patients, those with cancer and intravenous drug abusers).

The guideline does not cover
the diagnostic algorithm for PE;
evidence for cancer screening;
detailed comparisons of anticoagulant drugs;
who should be treated and not treated, specifically how to manage subsegmental PE;
duration of anticoagulation and thrombophilia investigations.

Methodology

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg or pulmonary embolism (PE) without cancer — anticoagulant selection: For long-term (first 3 months) therapy, we suggest dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (all Grade 2B), and for patients not treated with these agents, we suggest VKA therapy over LMWH (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy, and in patients with VTE and cancer ("cancer-associated thrombosis"), we still suggest LMWH over VKA.

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^113xQKTC]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guideline for the initial outpatient management of PE provides guidance on how to risk-stratify patients with suspected and confirmed PE and subsequently manage them in an outpatient or ambulatory care setting.

Over the last 10 years there has been an increasing drive to manage many conditions traditionally treated during an inpatient admission as outpatients. This has become widespread practice in managing deep vein thrombosis, and data are increasing to support this strategy in PE. With the licensing of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of acute PE which do not require a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) run-in or International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring, outpatient management of suspected PE has become more straightforward. This is clearly an opportunity to improve patient experience and reduce hospital length of stay, but it also presents a risk if the wrong patients are identified for outpatient management.

Many acute hospital trusts have begun outpatient management of both suspected and confirmed PE, as evidenced by the large number of abstracts presented at conference proceedings, in addition to peer-reviewed publications. However, it is readily apparent from these reports that practice varies, and it is of concern that in some units no validated risk assessment is being undertaken. Given that PE can be fatal, this raises concerns over the safety of some local protocols. This safety concern is further highlighted by the fact that a study of outpatient management of PE was terminated early by the Drug and Safety Monitoring Board after two deaths in the outpatient arm (one right ventricular thrombus and one fatal bleed).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of thromboembolic diseases published in 2012 and updated in 2015 provided no recommendations on how to risk-stratify for outpatient management. While both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Chest Physicians have also published guidance on the management of acute PE which both support outpatient management, neither provides detailed practical recommendations on risk stratification.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113cAQFs]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We update recommendations on 12 topics that were in the 9th edition of these guidelines, and address 3 new topics.

Methods

We generate strong (Grade 1) and weak (Grade 2) recommendations based on high- (Grade A), moderate- (Grade B), and low- (Grade C) quality evidence.

Results

For VTE and no cancer, as long-term anticoagulant therapy, we suggest dabigatran (Grade 2B), rivaroxaban (Grade 2B), apixaban (Grade 2B), or edoxaban (Grade 2B) over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and suggest VKA therapy over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Grade 2C). For VTE and cancer, we suggest LMWH over VKA (Grade 2B), dabigatran (Grade 2C), rivaroxaban (Grade 2C), apixaban (Grade 2C), or edoxaban (Grade 2C). We have not changed recommendations for who should stop anticoagulation at 3 months or receive extended therapy. For VTE treated with anticoagulants, we recommend against an inferior vena cava filter (Grade 1B). For DVT, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For subsegmental pulmonary embolism and no proximal DVT, we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation with a low risk of recurrent VTE (Grade 2C), and anticoagulation over clinical surveillance with a high risk (Grade 2C). We suggest thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism with hypotension (Grade 2B), and systemic therapy over catheter-directed thrombolysis (Grade 2C). For recurrent VTE on a non-LMWH anticoagulant, we suggest LMWH (Grade 2C); for recurrent VTE on LMWH, we suggest increasing the LMWH dose (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Of 54 recommendations included in the 30 statements, 20 were strong and none was based on high-quality evidence, highlighting the need for further research.

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115ufCuc]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 VTE treatment — acutely ill hospitalized with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): We suggest initial parenteral anticoagulation with therapeutic weight adjusted low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or IV unfractionated heparin (UFH). In patients without any drug-to-drug interactions, we suggest initial oral anticoagulation with apixaban or rivaroxaban; dabigatran and edoxaban can be used after initial parenteral anticoagulation, and vitamin K antagonist therapy can be used after overlap with initial parenteral anticoagulation. Thus LMWH or UFH are favored over oral anticoagulants.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^112gSYqM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Outpatient or early hospital discharge treatment of PE has the potential to reduce the patient and health care system burdens associated with treatment of PE. Mounting evidence suggests that outcomes in patients with low‐risk PE treated as outpatients are at least as good as, if not better than, outcomes in those treated in hospital. The approval of the DOACs apixaban and rivaroxaban, as single‐drug therapies for the treatment of PE, has increased the feasibility of early home treatment of PE, and available data suggest good outcomes in patients with PE treated with rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting. Patients with PE suitable for outpatient treatment are those with a low early mortality risk who are likely to be compliant with treatment. Physicians need to be confident in identifying these patients and available data suggest the PESI/sPESI and the Hestia exclusion criteria are useful tools that can be easily implemented in routine clinical practice. Although guidelines suggest limited added value of extra tests (such as RV functional assessment and cardiac biomarker measurement) for prognostic assessment, depending on physician attitude and/or the medicolegal environment, they may not be necessary when assessing patient suitability for outpatient treatment. Despite these additional tests being shown to reduce the proportion of patients classified as low risk, in some health care settings the extra reassurance and accountability provided by cardiac imaging showing normal RV function and/or normal levels of cardiac biomarkers may outweigh the extra time/resource use required for these assessments and, paradoxically, result in increased numbers of patients with PE treated as outpatients.

### Evidence-based anticoagulation choice for acute pulmonary embolism… [^111ScSKq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation is the foundation of treatment for most patients with pulmonary embolism. Guidelines recommend that most patients hospitalized for acute PE who are treated with parenteral anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight heparin rather than unfractionated heparin because LMWH achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more quickly and is associated with fewer bleeding complications. 1–3. Despite this recommendation, the proportion of US patients with acute PE initially treated with UFH increased from
41. 9% to 56. 3% between 2011 and 2020, whereas less than 10% of similar patients in Europe were treated with UFH. 4 Faced with such contradictory data, Stubblefield and colleagues5 conducted a robust qualitative study of 46 emergency physicians, hospitalists, and interventionalists in the US to understand the factors associated with anticoagulation decisions for PE.

Among the authors' conclusions were that emergency and hospitalist physicians share misconceptions regarding anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapies for PE. 5 Here, we address several of these crucial misunderstandings and the imperative to update these practices. To achieve therapeutic anticoagulation for PE, the patient must reach a target activated partial thromboplastin time or anti–factor Xa level. The belief that UFH leads to immediate therapeutic anticoagulation is contrary to published evidence. One study demonstrated that more than 75% of patients receiving UFH do not have a single therapeutic APTT within 12 hours of starting treatment, and more than 40% do not have a therapeutic level within 48 hours. 7 In contrast, LMWH typically reaches therapeutic levels 3 to 4 hours after administration.
6. We rely on these medications to deliver rapid results in life-threatening situations.

A heuristic favoring IV administration over other routes may lead some physicians to assume that UFH is a superior approach to anticoagulation in PE; yet for most patients, this assumption is not true.
3. The findings in the Stubblefield et al5 study suggest widespread misunderstanding of the pharmacology and guideline-recommended use of heparins in acute PE. Addressing these misconceptions and changing clinical practice will require a multifaceted approach, including pragmatic trials of anticoagulation effectiveness and safety in clinical settings, targeted educational programs from professional societies, and adoption of evidence-based policies by institutional quality committees. Ongoing emergency care research using implementation science frameworks should be conducted to modernize anticoagulation choices and improve outcomes for patients with PE.

### Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism… [^116K8NYS]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Initial Management Prompt diagnosis and treatment of VTE with appropriate medications may prevent thrombus extension and embolization, relieve acute symptoms, prevent cardiopulmonary collapse, and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Empiric treatment during the evaluation period is controversial and not evidence-based. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high probability of VTE, intravenous thrombolytic therapy can be considered. 8, 10, 11 Evidence supports outpatient treatment of PE if the risk of nonadherence is low and the patient is clinically stable; has no contraindications to anticoagulation, such as recent bleeding, severe renal or liver disease, or platelet count of less than 70 × 10³ per mm³; and feels capable of managing the disease at home. 8, 10 Patients with PE who are hemodynamically unstable should be admitted to an intensive care unit, and systemic thrombolytic therapy may be considered.
9. 12 However, unfractionated heparin is preferred in patients with severe renal insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. 7–9 Apixaban and rivaroxaban do not require concomitant use of heparin at initiation. The administration and dosing of anticoagulants are included in Table 1.
13. Thrombolysis Because of the high risk of bleeding, thrombolysis is restricted to specific circumstances. Expert consensus guidelines support thrombolytic therapy in patients with persistent hypotension or shock secondary to acute PE. 9 Also, when patients with acute PE who are on anticoagulation deteriorate but are not yet hypotensive, systemic thrombolysis is recommended as long as the risk of bleeding is low.

8 There is better evidence for systemic thrombolysis than for catheter-directed thrombolysis. 8 If systemic thrombolysis fails, catheter-directed thrombolysis is available as a rescue therapy in centers with appropriate expertise. Thrombolysis is not indicated in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE.
23. Long-term anticoagulation reduces the risk of recurrent VTE but results in more bleeding events. Considering this trade-off, it is critical that the duration of anticoagulation therapy be individualized based on the patient's risk of recurrence vs. risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding are summarized in.
