## Question

Hypoglycemia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypoglycemia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hypoglycemia and classifying severity. Then, I should verify immediate treatment by consciousness level and route. Next, I will review follow-up care and prevention, including education, technology, and medication adjustments. After that, I need to consider special populations and inpatient protocols. Finally, I will synthesize a concise algorithm and highlight key evidence gaps and implementation points, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines and studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on outdated thresholds. The ADA-endorsed classification uses three levels: Level 1 glucose less than 70 mg/dL but at least 54 mg/dL, Level 2 less than 54 mg/dL, and Level 3 severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance, which aligns with contemporary standards and supports risk stratification and treatment urgency, so I should keep these cut points front and center in the algorithm [^113JFxYQ].

> Now, I need to check the immediate treatment for conscious patients who can safely swallow. The preferred initial treatment is 15 g of fast-acting glucose, repeated in 15 minutes if glucose remains low, with avoidance of high-fat or high-protein foods for initial rescue because fat slows absorption; once recovered, a small snack with protein and complex carbohydrate helps stabilize levels, and I should double-check that this sequence is consistent across ADA and AACE guidance, which it is [^111hdkRp] [^113HavEv] [^115pXrxW] [^114Nt1pH] [^115R69Vs].

> Wait, let me verify dosing nuances for automated insulin delivery users. For individuals on AID systems, a smaller carbohydrate dose of 5–10 g may suffice unless hypoglycemia is exercise-related or follows a large overbolus, so I should tailor the 15 g default to the context to avoid rebound hyperglycemia, and I should confirm that this is explicitly recommended, which it is in ADA materials [^115R69Vs].

> Next, I should review severe hypoglycemia where the patient is unconscious or cannot safely swallow. Glucagon is first-line, and I need to ensure I specify the preferred formulation. Hold on, I should verify the current preference: ADA and Endocrine Society strongly recommend glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution for out-of-hospital use, and if there is no response in about 15 minutes, a second dose can be given while arranging emergency care. If IV access is available, IV dextrose 10–25 g of 50% dextrose over 1–3 minutes is appropriate, and I should confirm dosing ranges from multiple sources, which align across Canadian and U.S. guidance [^111xVEMh] [^1142RU2U] [^112GeyNd] [^115CzzYq] [^115pXrxW] [^114Nt1pH].

> I will now examine follow-up after initial treatment to prevent recurrence. Rechecking glucose about 15 minutes after treatment and repeating carbohydrates if still low is standard, and once glucose is above 70 mg/dL, a follow-up snack with protein and complex carbohydrate helps counter ongoing insulin or secretagogue effects; I should also confirm that we counsel on avoiding overtreatment and on the risk of recurrent hypoglycemia, which ADA emphasizes in structured education content [^111hdkRp] [^113HavEv] [^115R69Vs].

> Let me consider root-cause analysis and prevention because recurrent events demand system-level changes. Any Level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia should trigger a prompt reevaluation of the treatment plan, including deintensifying or switching therapies, and structured diabetes self-management education with hypoglycemia-specific modules should be provided and reinforced; I should confirm that both ADA and Endocrine Society make this a strong recommendation despite low-to-moderate certainty evidence, which they do [^1149B3QU] [^111bSFYh] [^115bEMp8] [^116FdDsw] [^1173eaqC] [^1149MPZ7].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of technology in prevention. CGM reduces hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes and in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, and real-time CGM is recommended for individuals at high risk. Inpatient CGM can reduce hypoglycemia in selected high-risk patients where resources allow, and algorithm-driven insulin delivery further reduces time in hypoglycemia, so I need to ensure I prioritize CGM for those on insulin or sulfonylureas at risk [^113rKgKd] [^114y7fxT] [^117Hjwfe] [^111TCaaR] [^112aFJGG].

> I need to ensure medication choices reflect hypoglycemia risk. Long-acting basal analogs reduce hypoglycemia versus NPH, and rapid-acting analogs reduce severe hypoglycemia compared with regular insulin; for patients with problematic hypoglycemia, CSII can be considered when feasible, and I should confirm that these are conditional but endorsed recommendations in the Endocrine Society guideline [^114y7fxT] [^114Rfx4k].

> But wait, what if the patient has impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. I should confirm that referral for evidence-based interventions to re-establish awareness is recommended, and that temporary relaxation of glycemic targets for several weeks can improve counterregulation; ADA and AACE endorse these strategies, and I should also screen for fear of hypoglycemia and cognitive decline that amplify risk [^113NRa1L] [^113UDoSs] [^114xL9KH] [^117SFqxM].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with older adults. In older or frail patients, individualize and often relax glycemic goals to prioritize avoidance of hypoglycemia, simplify regimens, and consider less stringent HbA1c targets or time-in-range goals. I should double-check that ADA provides explicit thresholds and emphasizes deintensification when harms outweigh benefits, which it does [^116xuvp1] [^1119aH1L] [^116sW3Rw] [^112tYZzu].

> I will now examine pediatrics. Real-time or intermittently scanned CGM should be offered at diagnosis or as soon as feasible for children on MDI or pumps, and less stringent HbA1c goals are reasonable after severe hypoglycemia or when risks outweigh benefits. ISPAD emphasizes education and technology to minimize time in hypoglycemia, so I should ensure family and school personnel are included in training plans [^1149RkiJ] [^114oBxaJ] [^112E58YY] [^115kFR4x].

> Let me verify inpatient protocols because hospital settings have unique hazards. Hospitals should implement hypoglycemia surveillance and management protocols, document all episodes for quality improvement, and consider real-time CGM for high-risk inpatients where feasible; SCCM also advises low-hypoglycemia-risk glycemic protocols and immediate treatment of hypoglycemia, which reinforces the need for standardized order sets and education [^114Ee6fo] [^116NVktY] [^111TCaaR] [^111qbeqN].

> I should double-check medication-specific caveats. For patients on alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, only monosaccharides like glucose or lactose-containing foods will work acutely because complex carbohydrates are not absorbed, so I need to ensure this nuance is taught and stocked appropriately [^115pXrxW] [^114Nt1pH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include a fixed-dose follow-up carbohydrate amount like 15–30 g with protein, but I should correct that to a principle-based instruction rather than a rigid number, advising a small snack with protein and complex carbohydrate tailored to the patient's meal plan and residual insulin activity, which is more consistent with ADA counseling and avoids overtreatment [^115R69Vs] [^115pXrxW].

> Let me synthesize the algorithm succinctly while keeping the verification mindset. Define severity using ADA levels. For conscious patients give 15 g glucose, repeat in 15 minutes if still low, then add protein and complex carbohydrate. For unconscious patients give glucagon without reconstitution preferred or IV dextrose if available, repeat glucagon in 15 minutes if needed. After any Level 2–3 event, reevaluate the regimen, intensify education, consider CGM, and adjust therapy to reduce recurrence, documenting and tracking outcomes for quality improvement [^113JFxYQ] [^111xVEMh] [^1149B3QU] [^117SFqxM].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge evidence gaps and implementation points. High-quality randomized data for acute treatment are limited, though guideline consensus supports the 15 g rule and modern glucagon formulations. Implementation hinges on prescribing glucagon, training caregivers, embedding CGM where appropriate, and building inpatient protocols, with ongoing measurement of hypoglycemia rates to close the loop on safety [^113JJnBt] [^112GeyNd] [^114Ee6fo].

---

Hypoglycemia management centers on **rapid recognition and treatment** using the 15–15–15 rule [^115R69Vs] for conscious patients and **glucagon or IV dextrose** for unconscious patients [^112GeyNd] [^115CzzYq]. Prevention relies on **structured education** [^1123tLcf], CGM [^113rKgKd], and **individualized treatment plans** [^117ESvZL] to reduce recurrence and restore hypoglycemia awareness [^113NRa1L]. Severe or recurrent events require **prompt reevaluation** of therapy [^1149B3QU] and medication adjustment [^111bSFYh].

---

## Definition and classification

Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose level **< 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)** [^115JzVTC] and classified by severity:

| **Level** | **Glucose threshold** | **Clinical description** |
|-|-|-|
| Level 1 | < 70 mg/dL (≥ 54 mg/dL) | Alert value; may need carbohydrate |
| Level 2 | < 54 mg/dL | Increased risk of cognitive dysfunction |
| Level 3 | Any glucose | Severe; requires assistance |

---

## Immediate management

### Conscious patients (able to swallow)

- **Rule of 15**: give 15 g fast-acting glucose (tablets, gel, or liquid) [^115R69Vs] [^113JJnBt].
- **Recheck**: measure glucose in 15 minutes; repeat if still < 70 mg/dL [^115R69Vs].
- **Follow-up**: after correction, provide a snack with complex carbs and protein [^115pXrxW].

---

### Unconscious patients or those unable to swallow

- **Glucagon**: 1 mg IM/SC [^115CzzYq]; prefer formulations not requiring reconstitution [^111xVEMh] [^1142RU2U].
- **IV dextrose**: 50 mL of 50% dextrose (25 g) IV push if glucagon is unavailable or ineffective [^115CzzYq].
- **Recovery feeding**: give carbohydrates orally once the patient awakens and can swallow [^111hdkRp] [^114Nt1pH].

---

## Preventive strategies

### Patient education

Education should be **structured** [^1123tLcf] for all patients on insulin or at risk, covering recognition, treatment, and prevention [^114xL9KH]. Individualized **plans** should include individualized targets, medication adjustments, and lifestyle modifications [^116qSeo2] [^117SFqxM].

---

### Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)

Use **CGM** [^113rKgKd] for patients at high risk or with impaired awareness to reduce hypoglycemia [^114xL9KH] [^117Hjwfe]. Educate patients to interpret **CGM data** and respond to alerts [^115QyU2K].

---

### Medication adjustments

Review and adjust therapy after **level 2 or 3 events** [^1149B3QU], including deintensification or switching agents [^111bSFYh]. In older adults, simplify regimens and **individualize goals** to minimize risk [^116sW3Rw] [^112tYZzu].

---

## Special considerations

### Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH)

Programs to restore awareness should be **evidence-based** [^113NRa1L] [^113UDoSs]. Temporarily **relax glycemic targets** for several weeks to improve counterregulation [^114xL9KH].

---

### Elderly patients

Less stringent **goals** are recommended, with HbA1c < 8.0% for those with limited life expectancy or comorbidities [^116xuvp1]. Deintensify when harms outweigh benefits, balancing risk and benefit [^116sW3Rw].

---

### Pediatric patients

CGM should be initiated as soon as feasible for children with **T1D** [^1149RkiJ]. Education should be **family-centered**, training caregivers in recognition and treatment [^115kFR4x].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track episodes in the **medical record** and review at each visit [^117SFqxM]. Use **quality metrics** to drive system improvements [^116NVktY].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Treat immediately**: use the 15–15–15 rule for conscious patients; glucagon or IV dextrose for unconscious patients [^115R69Vs] [^115CzzYq].
- **Prevent recurrence**: provide structured education, CGM, and individualized plans [^1123tLcf] [^113rKgKd].
- **Adjust therapy**: reevaluate after severe events; simplify and individualize in older adults [^1149B3QU] [^116sW3Rw].
- **Restore awareness**: use evidence-based programs and temporary target relaxation [^113NRa1L] [^114xL9KH].

---

Effective hypoglycemia management requires **rapid treatment**, **prevention strategies**, and **individualized care** to reduce recurrence and restore awareness.

Structured education to reduce hypoglycemia — justification and research needs: Overall, the panel determined that these data supported a strong recommendation for structured education for reducing hypoglycemia for people both with T1D and with T2D, although this recommendation was based on low-certainty evidence. Proposed areas for future research include evaluating the benefits of structured education in patients with T2D receiving noninsulin medications that increase hypoglycemia risk, comparing group vs individual programs, evaluating effects in diverse populations, and evaluating outcomes regarding who provides education, duration, virtual vs in-person formats, and involvement of patient partners and family.

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^114Qv3ZN]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In 2005, the American Diabetes Association Workgroup on Hypoglycemia released a report entitled "Defining and Reporting Hypoglycemia in Diabetes". In that report, recommendations were primarily made to advise the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on how hypoglycemia should be used as an end point in studies of new treatments for diabetes. In 2009, The Endocrine Society released a clinical practice guideline entitled "Evaluation and Management of Adult Hypoglycemic Disorders", which summarized how clinicians should manage hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. Since then, new evidence has become available that links hypoglycemia with adverse outcomes in older patients with type 2 diabetes and in children with type 1 diabetes. To provide guidance about how this new information should be incorporated into clinical practice, the American Diabetes Association and The Endocrine Society assembled a new Workgroup on Hypoglycemia in April 2012 to address the following questions:
How should hypoglycemia in diabetes be defined and reported?
What are the implications of hypoglycemia on both short- and long-term outcomes in people with diabetes?
What are the implications of hypoglycemia on treatment targets for patients with diabetes?
What strategies are known to prevent hypoglycemia, and what are the clinical recommendations for those at risk for hypoglycemia?
What are the current knowledge gaps in our understanding of hypoglycemia, and what research is necessary to fill these gaps?

### Clinical approaches to treat impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia [^1172G1US]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) affects between 25% and 30% of all people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and markedly increases risk of severe hypoglycaemia. This greatly feared complication of T1D impairs quality of life and has a recognised morbidity. People with T1D have an increased propensity to hypoglycaemia as a result of fundamental physiological defects in their ability to respond appropriately to a fall in blood glucose levels. With repeated exposure to low glucose, many then develop a condition referred to as IAH, where there is a reduced ability to perceive the onset of hypoglycaemia and take appropriate corrective action. The management of individuals with IAH relies initially on its identification in the clinic through a detailed exploration of the frequency of hypoglycaemia and an assessment of the individual's ability to recognise these episodes. In this review article, we will address the clinical strategies that may help in the management of the patient with IAH once identified, who may or may not also suffer from problematic hypoglycaemia. The initial focus is on how to identify such patients and then on the variety of approaches involving educational programmes and technological approaches that may be taken to minimise hypoglycaemia risk. No single approach can be advocated for all patients, and it is the role of the health care professional to identify the clinical strategy that best enables their patient to achieve this goal.

Conclusion

Hypoglycemia causes harm to people with diabetes, creating cardiovascular impairment and an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. Further, hypoglycemia significantly impacts the quality of life of patients with diabetes and can limit optimal glucose control. A patient-centered approach is imperative to achieve optimal glucose control while avoiding hypoglycemia and its harmful effects. A patient-centered approach is one that is based on shared medical decision-making among the patient, family and healthcare provider and uses individualized approaches to problem solving and diabetes management planning. Education aimed at recognizing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia is imperative for both patients and families. Appropriate teaching includes individual risk factors, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia. In addition, healthcare providers must work diligently with patients and families to identify and eradicate hypoglycemia by using appropriate glucose targets and medications and modifying lifestyle.

### Congenital hypoglycemia disorders: new aspects of etiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes: highlights of the proceedings of the congenital hypoglycemia disorders symposium, Philadelphia April 2016 [^114RTqp4]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia continues to be an important cause of morbidity in neonates and children. Prompt diagnosis and management of the underlying hypoglycemia disorder is critical for preventing brain damage and improving outcomes. Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common and severe cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and children. Recent discoveries of the genetic causes of HI have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology, but its management is complex and requires the integration of clinical, biochemical, molecular, and imaging findings to establish the appropriate treatment according to the subtype. Here we present a summary of a recent international symposium on congenital hypoglycemia disorders with emphasis on novel molecular mechanisms resulting in HI, genetic diagnosis, overall approach to management, novel therapies under development, and current outcomes.

### The barrier of hypoglycemia in diabetes [^111QRLCW]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia risk factor reduction.

It is, of course, preferable to prevent rather than treat iatrogenic hypoglycemia. The prevention of hypoglycemia requires the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction. That involves 1) acknowledging and addressing the problem, 2) applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy (diabetes self-management based on patient education and empowerment, frequent self blood glucose monitoring [and in some instances continuous glucose sensing], appropriate and flexible insulin [and other drug] regimens including use of insulin analogues, individualized glycemic goals, and ongoing professional guidance and support), 3) considering the conventional risk factors and adjusting the regimen appropriately, and 4) considering the risk factors indicative of HAAF in diabetes. With respect to the latter, a history of severe hypoglycemia should prompt consideration of a substantial change in the treatment regimen and a history of hypoglycemia unawareness should prompt consideration of a 2- to 3-week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia with the anticipation that awareness of hypoglycemia will return. Minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia while maintaining meaningful glycemic control is a challenge for people with diabetes and their caregivers, which is addressed in detail separately.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society guidelines: management of diabetes and high risk of hypoglycemia [^117Hjwfe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Interventions targeting hypoglycemia in people with diabetes are important for improving quality of life and reducing morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To support development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia.

Methods

We searched several databases for studies addressing 10 questions provided by a guideline panel from the Endocrine Society. Meta-analysis was conducted when feasible. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

We included 149 studies reporting on 43 344 patients. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reduced episodes of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and reduced the proportion of patients with hypoglycemia (blood glucose [BG] levels < 54 mg/dL). There were no data on use of real-time CGM with algorithm-driven insulin pumps vs multiple daily injections with BG testing in people with T1D. CGM in outpatients with type 2 diabetes taking insulin and/or sulfonylureas reduced time spent with BG levels under 70 mg/dL. Initiation of CGM in hospitalized patients at high risk for hypoglycemia reduced episodes of hypoglycemia with BG levels lower than 54 mg/dL and time spent under 54 mg/dL. The proportion of patients with hypoglycemia with BG levels lower than 70 mg/dL and lower than 54 mg/dL detected by CGM was significantly higher than point-of-care BG testing. We found no data evaluating continuation of personal CGM in the hospital. Use of an inpatient computerized glycemic management program utilizing electronic health record data was associated with fewer patients with and episodes of hypoglycemia with BG levels lower than 70 mg/dL and fewer patients with severe hypoglycemia compared with standard care. Long-acting basal insulin analogs were associated with less hypoglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin analogs were associated with reduced severe hypoglycemia, though there were more patients with mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Structured diabetes education programs reduced episodes of severe hypoglycemia and time below 54 mg/dL in outpatients taking insulin. Glucagon formulations not requiring reconstitution were associated with longer times to recovery from hypoglycemia, although the proportion of patients who recovered completely from hypoglycemia was not different between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

This systematic review summarized the best available evidence about several interventions addressing hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. This evidence base will facilitate development of clinical practice guidelines by the Endocrine Society.

Conclusions

Hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in tight glycemic management of diabetes and may increase vascular events in addition to other possible detrimental effects. Glycemic control should be individualized based on patient characteristics with some degree of safety. Recognition of hypoglycemia risk factors, blood glucose monitoring, selection of appropriate regimens, education programs for healthcare professionals and patients with diabetes are the major issues to maintain good glycemic control, minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, and prevent long- term complications.

What strategies are known to prevent hypoglycemia, and what are the clinical recommendations for those at risk for hypoglycemia?

Recurrent hypoglycemia increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and the development of hypoglycemia unawareness and HAAF. Effective approaches known to decrease the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia include patient education, dietary and exercise modifications, medication adjustment, careful glucose monitoring by the patient, and conscientious surveillance by the clinician.

Patient education

There is limited research related to the influence of self-management education on the incidence or prevention of hypoglycemia. However, there is clear evidence that diabetes education improves patient outcomes. As part of the educational plan, the individual with diabetes and his or her domestic companions need to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia and be able to treat a hypoglycemic episode properly with oral carbohydrates or glucagon. Hypoglycemia, including its risk factors and remediation, should be discussed routinely with patients receiving treatment with insulin or sulfonylurea/glinide drugs, especially those with a history of recurrent hypoglycemia or impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. In addition, patients must understand how their medications work so they can minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Care should be taken to educate patients on the typical pharmacokinetics of these medications. When evaluating a patient's report of hypoglycemia, it is important to adopt interviewing approaches that guide the patient to a correct identification of the precipitating factors of the episodes of hypoglycemia. Such a heuristic review of likely factors (skipped or inadequate meal, unusual exertion, alcohol ingestion, insulin dosage mishaps, etc.) in the period prior to the event can deepen the patient's appreciation of the behavioral factors that predispose to hypoglycemia.

There is convincing evidence that formal training programs that teach patients to replace insulin "physiologically" by giving background and mealtime/correction doses of insulin can reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia. The Insulin Treatment and Training programs developed by Mühlhauser and Berger have reported improved glycemic control comparable with DCCT while reducing the rates of severe hypoglycemia. These programs have been successfully delivered in other settings with comparable reductions in hypoglycemic risk. Patients with frequent hypoglycemia may also benefit from enrollment in a blood glucose awareness training program. In such a program, patients and their relatives are trained to recognize subtle cues and early neuroglycopenic indicators of evolving hypoglycemia and respond to them before the occurrence of disabling hypoglycemia.

3 INTRODUCTION

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in the management of T1D. It interferes with daily activities and poses a constant perceived threat to the individual and their families. It is a recognized limiting factor in achieving optimal glycemiawith an impact on quality of life. Minimizing hypoglycemia is an important objective of diabetes management that can be addressed by acknowledging the problem, evaluating the risk factors and applying the principles of intensive glycemic management. Therefore, it is vital to address this important clinical concern during diabetes education and institute appropriate management. The last two decades have experienced a paradigm shift in diabetes management through the availability of improved insulin analogues, insulin pump therapy and advent of CGM with algorithms incorporated in sensor‐augmented pump therapy (SAP) to reduce and prevent hypoglycemia. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the time spent in hypoglycemia, and the rates of severe hypoglycemia have declined in recent years in developed countries with newer intensive therapies. Unfortunately, hypoglycemia continues to be a problem in countries with limited resources, where many children are treated with insulin injections, with minimal access to technology and resources.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^115WfwXh]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

During the first 24–48 hours of life, as normal neonates transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, their plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are typically lower than later in life. – Published guidelines for screening at-risk newborns and managing low PG concentrations in neonates focus on the immediate neonatal period, but do not address the diagnosis and management of disorders causing recurrent and prolonged hypoglycemia. – Distinguishing between transitional neonatal glucose regulation in normal newborns and hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important for prompt diagnosis and effective treatment to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury.

Moreover, the evaluation and management of pediatric hypoglycemia differ in several respects from that in adults, for whom guidelines were recently published. First, persistent hypoglycemia most often results from a congenital or genetic defect in regulating secretion of insulin, deficiency of cortisol and/or growth hormone, or defects in the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids. Second, it may be difficult to identify and distinguish newborn infants with a persistent hypoglycemia disorder from those with transitional low glucose levels in the initial 48 hours of life, as detailed in the separate document on transitional neonatal hypoglycemia prepared by our committee. Third, the first few months of life are the most vulnerable period for developmental disability, which occurs in ~25%–50% of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for preventing these sequelae. –

To address these deficiencies, the Pediatric Endocrine Society convened an expert panel of pediatric endocrinologists and neonatologists to develop guidelines for managing hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children, but excluding children with diabetes. The goals of these guidelines are to help physicians recognize persistent hypoglycemia disorders, guide their expeditious diagnosis and effective treatment, and prevent brain damage in at-risk babies.

### Hypoglycemia [^11746XQr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is a common, potentially avoidable consequence of diabetes treatment and is a major barrier to initiating or intensifying antihyperglycemic therapy in efforts to achieve better glycemic control. Therapy regimen and a history of hypoglycemia are the most important predictors of future events. Other risk factors include renal insufficiency, older age, and history of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure. Reported rates of hypoglycemia vary considerably among studies because of differences in study design, definitions used, and population included, among other factors. Although occurring more frequently in type 1 diabetes, hypoglycemia also is clinically important in type 2 diabetes. Symptoms experienced by patients vary among individuals, and many events remain undiagnosed. The incidence of severe events is unevenly distributed, with only a small proportion (∼ 5%) of individuals accounting for > 50% of events. Consequently, clinicians must be conscientious in obtaining thorough patient histories, because an accurate picture of the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic events is essential for optimal diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia in particular is associated with an increased risk of mortality, impairments in cognitive function, and adverse effects on patients' quality of life. Economically, hypoglycemia burdens the healthcare system and adversely affects workplace productivity, particularly after a nocturnal event. Ongoing healthcare reform efforts will result in even more emphasis on reducing this side effect of diabetes treatment. Therefore, improving patients' self-management skills and selecting or modifying therapy to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia will increase in importance for clinicians and patients alike.

Values

Failure to investigate a neonate, infant, or child with suspected hypoglycemia increases the risk of delaying a definitive diagnosis and instituting effective treatment. Expeditiously identifying the specific cause of hypoglycemia, as outlined above, will enable prompt institution of appropriate treatment and decrease the risk of permanent brain injury from persistent and recurrent severe hypoglycemia. The decision to subject an infant or child to a diagnostic investigation for suspected hypoglycemia, which includes a monitored assessment of fasting adaptation that may expose the patient to the risk of another episode of hypoglycemia, places a higher value on achieving diagnostic certainty and a lower value on avoiding the discomfort, inconvenience, and cost of such procedures.

Methods

Evidence Retrieval and Rating

The committee searched for existing evidence synthesis reports, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The committee also evaluated guidelines published by the Endocrine Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, Canadian Pediatric Society, and others, and reviewed their bibliographies. – Committee members identified additional individual studies.

The committee adopted the framework of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group, in which guideline developers rate their confidence in the evidence as very low (+000), low (++00), moderate (+++0), or high (++++). Randomized trials start as high, and observational studies start as low.

Grading the Strength of Recommendations

The guideline developers considered the quality of the evidence. They also considered the balance between benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, cost and resource utilization, and other societal and contextual factors, such as availability of technology and health services and implementation barriers. The recommendations according to the GRADE framework are either strong (GRADE 1), stated as "we recommend", or weak (GRADE 2), stated as "we suggest".

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^115JzVTC]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

How should hypoglycemia in diabetes be defined and reported?

Hypoglycemia puts patients at risk for injury and death. Consequently the workgroup defines iatrogenic hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes as all episodes of an abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that expose the individual to potential harm. A single threshold value for plasma glucose concentration that defines hypoglycemia in diabetes cannot be assigned because glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia (among other responses) shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations after recent antecedent hypoglycemia and to higher plasma glucose concentrations in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and infrequent hypoglycemia.

Nonetheless, an alert value can be defined that draws the attention of both patients and caregivers to the potential harm associated with hypoglycemia. The workgroup suggests that patients at risk for hypoglycemia (i.e. those treated with a sulfonylurea, glinide, or insulin) should be alert to the possibility of developing hypoglycemia at a self-monitored plasma glucose — or continuous glucose monitoring subcutaneous glucose — concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). This alert value is data driven and pragmatic. Given the limited accuracy of the monitoring devices, it approximates the lower limit of the normal postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration, the glycemic thresholds for activation of glucose counterregulatory systems in nondiabetic individuals, and the upper limit of plasma glucose level reported to reduce counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. Because it is higher than the glycemic threshold for symptoms in both nondiabetic individuals and those with well-controlled diabetes, it generally allows time to prevent a clinical hypoglycemic episode and provides some margin for the limited accuracy of monitoring devices at low-glucose levels. People with diabetes need not always self-treat at an estimated glucose concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). Options other than carbohydrate ingestion include repeating the test in the short term, changing behavior (e.g. avoiding driving or elective exercise until the glucose level is higher), and adjusting the treatment regimen. Although this alert value has been debated, a plasma concentration of ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) can be used as a cut-off value in the classification of hypoglycemia in diabetes.

Consistent with past recommendations, the workgroup suggests the following classification of hypoglycemia in diabetes:

Diabetes hypoglycemia management — For measured glucose < 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] in persons able to safely swallow, fast-acting carbohydrates followed by complex carbohydrates should be used, and glucagon should be used to correct hypoglycemia if individuals are unable or unwilling to ingest carbohydrates orally; if there is no response after 15 min, an additional same dose may be administered. Persons with severe hypoglycemia with altered mental status or with profound hypoglycemia need to be hospitalized, persons treated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors must be given oral glucose or lactose-containing foods, and persons at risk for hypoglycemia should perform frequent blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or preferably use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices.

Prevention of hypoglycemia

While achieving and maintaining the optimal glycemic control is one of the principal aims of prevention and management of diabetes complications, hypoglycemia remains a major challenge. Obviously prevention of hypoglycemia is preferable to its treatment since as compared with a reactive approach, prevention is much more likely to avoid severe events and economic burden. The prevention of hypoglycemia requires some principles consideration. These principles include: 1) diabetes self-management (supported by education and empowerment); 2) self- monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose sensing; 3) flexible and appropriate insulin or other drug regimens; 4) individualized glycemic goals; 5) consideration of known risk factors of hypoglycemia; 6) professional support and guidance.

Diabetes self-management, supported by education and empowerment, is a basic part of diabetes care to achieve successful health-related outcomes. Several studies have found that diabetes self-management education (DSME) results in behavior changes with positive influence on outcome. Patients with diabetes need to be well informed about the symptoms of hypoglycemia, to know about hypoglycemia risk factors, prevention and treatment, and to be concern about monitoring of blood glucose levels. Therefore educating the patients of all ages and their relatives about hypoglycemia is a key factor in prevention of this complication.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus: risks and practical prevention strategies [^114T4peC]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Hypoglycaemia, which occurs when blood levels of glucose fall below what is considered a normal range, is a well-known complication of insulin therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite advances in diabetes mellitus management, hypoglycaemia has continued to affect the majority of these individuals, leading to suboptimal care and decreased quality of life. Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated the risks associated with hypoglycaemic events. With this understanding, various advances have been made in therapeutics for diabetes mellitus management. Diabetes mellitus education continues to form the foundation for management and prevention of hypoglycaemia. The advent of newer diabetes mellitus technologies and newer insulins herald improvements in management strategies and hypoglycaemia prevention. Improved understanding of these newer approaches is needed to ensure delivery of safe and effective care to individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus, leading to reductions in both the short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with hypoglycaemic events.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117SFqxM]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes — hypoglycemia assessment, prevention, and treatment recommendations state to review history of hypoglycemia at every clinical encounter for all individuals at risk for hypoglycemia, and evaluate hypoglycemic events as indicated; clinicians should consider an individual's risk for hypoglycemia when selecting diabetes medications and glycemic goals, and use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is beneficial and recommended for individuals at high risk for hypoglycemia. Screen individuals at high risk for hypoglycemia or with severe and/or recurrent hypoglycemia for fear of hypoglycemia at least annually and when clinically appropriate, and refer to a trained health care professional for evidence-based intervention. Glucose is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with glucose < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L); avoid using foods or beverages high in fat and/or protein for initial treatment of hypoglycemia, and fifteen minutes after initial treatment, repeat the treatment if hypoglycemia persists. Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals taking insulin or at high risk for hypoglycemia; family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to those individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it, and glucagon preparations that do not have to be reconstituted are preferred. All individuals taking insulin or at risk for hypoglycemia should receive structured education for hypoglycemia prevention and treatment, with ongoing education for those who experience hypoglycemic events. One or more episodes of level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia should prompt reevaluation of the treatment plan, including deintensifying or switching diabetes medications if appropriate. Regularly assess cognitive function; if impaired or declining cognition is found, the clinician, person with diabetes, and caregiver should increase vigilance for hypoglycemia.

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114y7fxT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Endocrine Society hypoglycemia guideline — results outline scope and recommendation strengths: The panel agreed on 10 questions specific to hypoglycemia risk and prevention in people with diabetes for which 10 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithm-driven insulin pumps in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), use of CGM for outpatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs, and initiation and continuation of CGM for select inpatient populations at high risk for hypoglycemia. Strong recommendations were made for structured diabetes education programs for those at high risk for hypoglycemia; use of glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution versus those that do for managing severe outpatient hypoglycemia for adults and children; for children, use of real-time CGM for individuals with T1D receiving multiple daily injections; and the use of inpatient glycemic management programs leveraging electronic health record data to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Evaluation and management of adult hypoglycemic disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7PbH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim is to provide guidelines for the evaluation and management of adults with hypoglycemic disorders, including those with diabetes mellitus.

Evidence

Using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence is graded very low (plus sign in circle ooo), low (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle oo), moderate (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle o), or high (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle).

Conclusions

We recommend evaluation and management of hypoglycemia only in patients in whom Whipple's triad — symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of those symptoms or signs after the plasma glucose concentration is raised — is documented. In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies — drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction — addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations — in persons with diabetes.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xL9KH]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Hypoglycemia prevention — education, technology, and treatment plan adjustments are emphasized: A multicomponent hypoglycemia prevention plan is critical to caring for individuals at risk, and structured education for hypoglycemia prevention and treatment is critical and has been shown to improve hypoglycemia outcomes. Education should ideally be provided through a diabetes self-management education and support program or by a trained diabetes care and education specialist; if structured education is not available, clinicians should educate individuals on definitions, precipitating situations, warning signs, step-by-step treatment, and appropriate glucagon use. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be a valuable tool for detecting and preventing hypoglycemia and is recommended for insulin-treated individuals, with clinical trial evidence that CGM reduces rates of hypoglycemia; CGM can also reveal asymptomatic hypoglycemia. An essential component is appropriate modification to diabetes treatment in the setting of intercurrent illness or to prevent recurrent events, and Level 2 or 3 hypoglycemic events especially should trigger a reevaluation of the diabetes treatment plan with consideration of deintensification and individualized goals. Individuals with impaired awareness should be offered training to reestablish awareness of hypoglycemia; although formal hypoglycemia awareness training programs have reduced hypoglycemia and improved quality of life in people with type 1 diabetes, these programs are not currently available for clinical use and similar training may be provided by qualified professionals. Several weeks of avoidance of hypoglycemia via temporary relaxation of glycemic goals can improve counterregulation and awareness, and individuals with impaired hypoglycemia awareness and current hypoglycemic episodes may benefit from short-term relaxation of glycemic goals.

### Hypoglycemia: minimizing its impact in type 2 diabetes [^114ToLz5]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia and provide guidance for the prevention of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Methods

We review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia, providing specific guidance regarding the prevention of hypoglycemia and judicial selection of glucose-lowering agents in individuals with T2DM.

Results

Hypoglycemia in T2DM is underrecognized and underreported. Emerging evidence from large clinical trials suggest that hypoglycemia may be an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in T2DM. In addition, hypoglycemia is associated with reduced quality of life, greater healthcare utilization costs, and poor adherence to medical regiments.

Conclusion

These findings have led professional organizations to emphasize the prevention of hypoglycemia as an important consideration when initiating or intensifying treatment regimens. In clinical settings, particular attention should be paid to a patient's risk for hypoglycemia when initiating or intensifying the pharmacological treatment regimen. The endocrinologist can play an important role in educating not only the patient, but also other members of the diabetes-management team regarding the need for individualized therapy.

### Hypoglycemia. pathophysiology and treatment [^114GE8JL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is a common consequence of many diabetes treatments. As is true for many therapies for diseases with major pathologic consequences, the benefits and risks of treatment must be balanced. In intensified diabetes management, hypoglycemia is not an insurmountable problem but is unfortunately inevitable using the methods of glucose control currently available. Patients with type 1 diabetes seem to be at greater risk than patients with type 2 disease. The health care team must strive to help the patient maintain normoglycemia. The results of the DCCT and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study prove that near normoglycemia is clearly in the patient's best interest. Patient education has become focused on minimizing hyperglycemia; counseling on the dangers of hypoglycemia has not been given the same stature. Emphasis must be placed on minimizing even minor subclinical hypoglycemia because it will contribute to a vicious cycle of hypoglycemia begetting hypoglycemia.

### Hypoglycaemia and its management in primary care setting [^117EeJYq]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and constitutes a major limiting factor in achieving glycaemic control among people with diabetes. While hypoglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose level under 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L), symptoms may occur at higher blood glucose levels in individuals with poor glycaemic control. Severe hypoglycaemia is defined as an episode requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions to assure neurologic recovery. Hypoglycaemia is the most important safety outcome in clinical studies of glucose lowering agents. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care recommends that a management protocol for hypoglycaemia should be designed and implemented by every hospital, along with a clear prevention and treatment plan. A tailored approach, using clinical and pathophysiologic disease stratification, can help individualize glycaemic goals and promote new therapies to improve quality of life of patients. Data from recent large clinical trials reported low risk of hypoglycaemic events with the use of newer anti-diabetic drugs. Increased hypoglycaemia risk is observed with the use of insulin and/or sulphonylureas. Vulnerable patients with T2D at dual risk of severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular outcomes show features of "frailty". Many of such patients may be better treated by the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors rather than insulin. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) should be considered for all individuals with increased risk for hypoglycaemia, impaired hypoglycaemia awareness, frequent nocturnal hypoglycaemia and with history of severe hypoglycaemia. Patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia benefit from real-time CGM. The diabetes educator is an invaluable resource and can devote the time needed to thoroughly educate the individual to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and integrate the information within the entire construct of diabetes self-management. Conversations about hypoglycaemia facilitated by a healthcare professional may reduce the burden and fear of hypoglycaemia among patients with diabetes and their family members. Optimizing insulin doses and carbohydrate intake, in addition to a short warm up before or after the physical activity sessions may help avoiding hypoglycaemia. Several therapeutic considerations are important to reduce hypoglycaemia risk during pregnancy including administration of rapid-acting insulin analogues rather than human insulin, pre-conception initiation of insulin analogues, and immediate postpartum insulin dose reduction.

### Emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia: a guideline and evidence review [^113JJnBt]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the current treatment guidelines for the emergency management of hypoglycaemia and the evidence underpinning recommendations.

Methods

International diabetes agencies were searched for hypoglycaemia treatment guidelines. Guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. An electronic database search was conducted for evidence regarding emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults, and relevant articles were critically appraised.

Results

Of the international diabetes agencies, six sets of guidelines were deemed relevant and of sufficient detail for appraisal by AGREE II. The evidence search returned 2649 articles, of which 17 pertaining to the emergency management of hypoglycaemia were included. High-quality evidence for the management of hypoglycaemia was lacking, limiting treatment recommendations. In general, guidelines and studies were somewhat concordant and recommended 15–20 g of oral glucose or sucrose, repeated after 10–15 min for treatment of the responsive adult, and 10% intravenous dextrose or 1 mg intramuscular glucagon for treatment of the unresponsive adult. No evidence was found for other treatment approaches.

Conclusion

Evidence for the emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults is limited, is often low grade and mostly pre-dates contemporary management of diabetes. Guideline recommendations are limited by the lack of randomized trials. Further high-quality studies are required to inform the optimum management of this frequently occurring emergency condition.

Question 14: How should hypoglycemia be managed — Recommendations 14.1–14.5 — states that oral rapidly absorbed glucose followed by a snack or meal containing both protein and carbohydrates "should be used to treat hypoglycemia (measured glucose < 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L])" if the person "is able to safely swallow" (Grade A; BEL 1). Glucagon "should be used to correct hypoglycemia if individuals are unable or unwilling to ingest carbohydrates orally", and "If there is no response after 15 minutes, an additional same dose may be administered", with carbohydrate given once able to swallow (Grade A; BEL 1). "Individuals with prolonged hypoglycemia need to be hospitalized", several weeks of avoidance "may at least partially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness" and regimen adjustment "may be necessary" (Grade B; BEL 1). For those on alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, "oral glucose or lactose-containing foods (dairy products) should be given" because these drugs inhibit absorption of complex carbohydrates and disaccharides (Grade A; BEL 1). Persons at risk "should perform frequent BGM or preferably use CGM devices" (Grade B; BEL 4 and expert opinion of task force).

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1167vzLV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is common, especially in those taking medications such as insulin and sulfonylureas (SU) that place them at higher risk. Hypoglycemia is associated with distress in those with diabetes and their families, medication nonadherence, and disruption of life and work, and it leads to costly emergency department visits and hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality.

Objective

To review and update the diabetes-specific parts of the 2009 Evaluation and Management of Adult Hypoglycemic Disorders: Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline and to address developing issues surrounding hypoglycemia in both adults and children living with diabetes. The overriding objectives are to reduce and prevent hypoglycemia.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinician experts, together with a patient representative, and methodologists with expertise in evidence synthesis and guideline development, identified and prioritized 10 clinical questions related to hypoglycemia in people living with diabetes. Systematic reviews were conducted to address all the questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 questions specific to hypoglycemia risk and prevention in people with diabetes for which 10 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithm-driven insulin pumps in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), use of CGM for outpatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs, and initiation of and continuation of CGM for select inpatient populations at high risk for hypoglycemia. Strong recommendations were made for structured diabetes education programs for those at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution vs those that do for managing severe outpatient hypoglycemia for adults and children, use of real-time CGM for individuals with T1D receiving multiple daily injections, and the use of inpatient glycemic management programs leveraging electronic health record data to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

The recommendations are based on the consideration of critical outcomes as well as implementation factors such as feasibility and values and preferences of people with diabetes. These recommendations can be used to inform clinical practice and health care system improvement for this important complication for people living with diabetes.
