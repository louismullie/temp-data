## Question

mifepristone use for cushings and side effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mifepristone use for Cushing's syndrome and its side effects, with attention to indications, dosing, efficacy, adverse effects, monitoring, and comparative positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the indication is appropriate and how the drug works. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and typical dosing strategies. Next, I will examine adverse effects, drug interactions, and monitoring. After that, I need to check contraindications and special populations. Finally, I will compare with alternatives and outline a pragmatic algorithm, making sure to flag any inconsistencies and self-correct them as I go [^114Zourp] [^114jGybA].

> Let me first confirm the indication and the mechanism. Mifepristone (Korlym) is FDA approved to control hyperglycemia secondary to endogenous Cushing's syndrome in adults with type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance who have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery, and it should not be used for type 2 diabetes outside of Cushing's syndrome, which I need to emphasize to avoid off-label drift, and its mechanism is glucocorticoid receptor antagonism with concomitant progesterone receptor blockade, leading to clinical improvement despite rising serum cortisol and ACTH, so response is judged clinically rather than biochemically [^114Zourp] [^114jGybA] [^112ENgz3] [^1161ZEeS].

> Next, I should review the evidence base and ask, does clinical efficacy hold across domains we care about. The SEISMIC study showed significant improvements in glycemia with a 60 percent response, reductions in HbA1c and fasting glucose, clinically meaningful weight loss, and global clinical improvement in most patients, with long-term extension analyses demonstrating sustained weight reductions approaching 9 percent over a median near 29 months, which aligns with real-world durability of effect on metabolic endpoints [^115iEZ1U] [^115JknXv] [^1165e5vn] [^112XSk6F].

> Now, I need to check the dosing regimen and titration cadence. Standard practice is to start at 300 mg orally once daily and titrate in 300 mg increments based on clinical response and tolerability to a usual maximum of 1200 mg daily, with titration commonly at about two-week to several-week intervals in trials, and lower maintenance doses may suffice once targets are met, which I should tailor to symptom control and adverse events rather than cortisol levels [^116wN971] [^1127YsAP] [^114jGybA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a source stating a maximum of 600 mg per day. Let me verify that before concluding. The SPL entry indicating a 600 mg maximum would conflict with the Korlym label and clinical data that allow up to 1200 mg daily in Cushing's syndrome; given the FDA Korlym labeling and trial protocols, the 1200 mg ceiling is the appropriate maximum for Korlym in this indication, so the 600 mg figure appears to reflect a different context or legacy labeling and should not override the current Cushing's label, and I will explicitly correct to the 1200 mg maximum while documenting that the 600 mg value was seen in SPL content [^115Xcx98] [^1127YsAP] [^116wN971].

> I should also consider edge cases. In severe refractory disease, case literature reports higher off-label dosing up to approximately 25 mg per kg per day with clinical benefit, but this comes with increased risks such as marked hypokalemia requiring mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, so I would reserve such dosing for exceptional, closely monitored scenarios after multidisciplinary discussion [^112PvXKn] [^113NhJ4P].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without categorizing serious adverse reactions and their mechanisms. Excessive glucocorticoid receptor blockade can present with an adrenal insufficiency–like syndrome characterized by weakness, nausea, fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia; critically, serum cortisol and ACTH remain elevated and are not reliable for diagnosis during treatment, so I must diagnose clinically and treat promptly by interrupting mifepristone and giving high-dose dexamethasone, factoring in the long half-life of mifepristone when deciding duration of rescue steroids, and then consider resuming at a lower dose after resolution [^112ENgz3] [^114jGybA] [^113Ci4Hf].

> I will now examine hypokalemia, since this is both common and potentially severe. Wait, let me verify the mechanism and frequency. Hypokalemia arises because increased circulating cortisol, unopposed at the mineralocorticoid receptor, drives kaliuresis; it occurred in roughly 44 percent of patients in trials, with severe cases documented, so I should correct potassium before initiation, recheck 1 to 2 weeks after starting or dose escalation, and periodically thereafter, treating with potassium supplementation and often spironolactone to counter mineralocorticoid effects, and be vigilant because intercurrent illness can precipitate more severe presentations [^112ENgz3] [^112PvXKn] [^115JjkTT] [^113Ci4Hf].

> Let me consider reproductive tract effects next, because progesterone receptor antagonism has predictable consequences. Endometrial thickening and abnormal uterine bleeding are relatively frequent, sometimes prompting discontinuation, so I should counsel menstruating patients in advance, monitor for bleeding, and arrange gynecologic evaluation when indicated, recognizing that endometrial changes are typically reversible with drug discontinuation [^1138eKWX] [^113Ci4Hf].

> I should review other common adverse reactions to anticipate and contextualize risk. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, peripheral edema, arthralgia, back or limb pain, and respiratory tract symptoms such as nasopharyngitis or sinusitis are reported, and laboratory changes may include decreased serum potassium and increased TSH, so I will monitor symptoms and labs proactively and adjust the dose if tolerability becomes limiting [^1138eKWX] [^113Ci4Hf].

> Next, I should review drug interactions, and I need to ensure I check the CYP profile. Mifepristone inhibits CYP3A as well as CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, so interacting co-medications metabolized by these pathways may have increased exposure, mandating a careful medication reconciliation, avoidance or dose adjustments of sensitive substrates, and close follow-up after each titration [^114jGybA].

> For monitoring, I should double-check that I am aligning with label guidance. Clinical assessment is primary because biochemical cortisol measurements are misleading during receptor blockade; lab surveillance should include potassium at baseline, 1 to 2 weeks after initiation or dose increase, and periodically thereafter, HbA1c or glucose to track efficacy, TSH given reports of increases, and gynecologic surveillance for women with bleeding or suspected endometrial changes, while also screening for precipitating stressors such as infection that can unmask or worsen adrenal insufficiency–like presentations [^112ENgz3] [^1138eKWX].

> Now, I need to check contraindications and special populations to avoid preventable harm. Pregnancy is a strict contraindication due to known fetal risk, so effective contraception and pregnancy testing are essential before and during therapy; no dose adjustment is needed for creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL per minute, pediatric use is off label with only case-level evidence, and women of childbearing potential require counseling given progesterone receptor antagonism [^1113NNAa] [^116tTdtJ] [^116GhwGw] [^114Zourp].

> Let me place mifepristone among alternatives, and I should verify guideline positioning. Endocrine Society guidance supports a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist such as mifepristone in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or have persistent disease after pituitary surgery, while steroidogenesis inhibitors like ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, and etomidate, and pituitary-directed agents including pasireotide, also have defined roles depending on etiology and clinical scenario; Signifor is specifically approved for Cushing's disease when pituitary surgery is not an option or not curative, so selection should be individualized to goals and comorbidities [^111HCyxg] [^112jwJFW] [^116zZ34A] [^114jGybA].

> But wait, what about ectopic ACTH syndrome and severe neuropsychiatric or metabolic manifestations. In ectopic ACTH syndrome, retrospective data show that mifepristone can rapidly improve psychosis and glycemic control, with survival similar to bilateral adrenalectomy in one series, although aggressive management of hypokalemia and hypertension is often necessary, which reinforces the importance of a protocolized electrolyte strategy when cortisol remains high at the mineralocorticoid receptor [^115JjkTT].

> I should now synthesize a practical algorithm, but let me first confirm consistency with label monitoring while acknowledging the source trace was truncated at this step. A pragmatic approach is to confirm the labeled indication, reconcile medications for CYP interactions, ensure contraception and negative pregnancy testing, start 300 mg daily, recheck potassium at 1 to 2 weeks, and titrate in 300 mg increments toward clinical targets for hyperglycemia and Cushingoid features while watching for adrenal insufficiency–like symptoms, hypokalemia, and endometrial effects; if adrenal insufficiency–like symptoms emerge, interrupt mifepristone and administer dexamethasone, then resume at a lower dose when resolved, and maintain periodic assessment of glucose, potassium, TSH, blood pressure, weight, and functional status throughout therapy [^112ENgz3] [^1127YsAP] [^114jGybA].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Mifepristone is indicated for hyperglycemia due to Cushing's syndrome in adults with diabetes or glucose intolerance after failed or unavailable surgery, improves glycemia, weight, and overall clinical status without lowering cortisol, requires clinical rather than biochemical monitoring, has predictable adverse effects that are manageable with proactive protocols, and is best positioned for patients with prominent metabolic disease, especially when surgery is not curative or feasible, with a maximum Korlym dose of 1200 mg daily despite older or alternative sources citing lower maxima, which I have cross-checked and corrected here [^114Zourp] [^115iEZ1U] [^1127YsAP] [^112ENgz3] [^114jGybA].

Mifepristone is **indicated for hyperglycemia in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome** [^114Zourp] who have failed or are not candidates for surgery [^111HCyxg], with a typical dose of 300 mg/day and a maximum of 1,200 mg/day [^1127YsAP] [^116wN971]. It improves glycemic control [^115iEZ1U], blood pressure [^1151Hz8m], and weight [^111gA2Bb], but **does not lower cortisol**, so response is assessed clinically [^114jGybA] [^112ENgz3]. The most common side effects are hypokalemia, adrenal insufficiency, endometrial thickening/bleeding, fatigue, nausea, headache, and hypertension [^1138eKWX] [^113Ci4Hf]; hypokalemia and adrenal insufficiency require close monitoring and prompt management [^112ENgz3]. Mifepristone is contraindicated in pregnancy [^1113NNAa] and can interact with CYP3A/CYP2C8/2C9 substrates [^114jGybA].

---

## Indications and dosing

For the **indication**, mifepristone is used to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism [^114Zourp] in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have failed surgery or are not surgical candidates [^111HCyxg]. For **dosing**, start at 300 mg orally once daily [^1127YsAP] and titrate to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day based on clinical response and tolerability [^116wN971].

---

## Clinical efficacy

In Cushing's syndrome, mifepristone **improves glycemic control**, blood pressure, and weight:

- **Glycemic control**: Significant improvements in glucose tolerance [^112Z82QQ], insulin sensitivity, and reductions in HbA1c and fasting glucose [^115iEZ1U].

- **Blood pressure**: Reductions in diastolic blood pressure [^1151Hz8m] and improved hypertension control [^115iEZ1U].

- **Weight loss**: Sustained weight loss [^111gA2Bb] and reduced waist circumference [^1165e5vn].

---

## Side effects and adverse reactions

Mifepristone has a **distinct safety profile** related to its glucocorticoid receptor antagonism:

| **Adverse reaction** | **Frequency** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypokalemia | Very common (> 10%) | Requires monitoring and supplementation [^112ENgz3] [^1138eKWX] |
| Adrenal insufficiency | Common (1–10%) | Monitor clinically; manage with glucocorticoids [^112ENgz3] |
| Endometrial thickening/bleeding | Very common (> 10%) | Monitor in women; may require intervention [^1138eKWX] |
| Fatigue, nausea, headache | Very common (> 10%) | Generally mild; may require dose adjustment [^1138eKWX] |
| Hypertension | Very common (> 10%) | Monitor and manage appropriately [^1138eKWX] |
| Elevated TSH | Very common (> 10%) | Monitor thyroid function [^1138eKWX] |
| Rash, pruritus | Common (1–10%) | Generally mild [^116JN3Bb] |
| Menstrual irregularities | Common (1–10%) | Monitor in women [^116JN3Bb] |

---

## Monitoring and management

- **Clinical monitoring**: Assess for adrenal insufficiency [^112ENgz3], hypokalemia, hypertension, and endometrial changes [^1138eKWX].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regularly check serum potassium [^112ENgz3], thyroid function [^1138eKWX], and clinical parameters of hypercortisolism [^114jGybA].

- **Management of adverse effects**: Treat hypokalemia [^112ENgz3] with supplementation; manage adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoids [^115EoyRR]; address endometrial changes as needed [^112ENgz3] [^1138eKWX].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Pregnancy: **contraindicated** due to risk of fetal harm [^1113NNAa]. Drug interactions: review for interactions involving **CYP3A and CYP2C8/2C9** [^114jGybA].

---

Mifepristone is effective for **hyperglycemia in Cushing's syndrome** [^114Zourp], with benefits in glycemia, blood pressure, and weight [^115iEZ1U] [^111gA2Bb]; monitor for hypokalemia, adrenal insufficiency, and endometrial effects [^1138eKWX], and manage adverse effects promptly [^112ENgz3].

### Korlym [^112ENgz3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Patients receiving mifepristone may experience adrenal insufficiency. Because serum cortisol levels remain elevated and may even increase during treatment with Korlym, serum cortisol levels do not provide an accurate assessment of hypoadrenalism in patients receiving Korlym. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including weakness, nausea, increased fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, discontinue treatment with Korlym immediately and administer glucocorticoids without delay. High doses of supplemental glucocorticoids may be needed to overcome the glucocorticoid receptor blockade produced by mifepristone. Factors considered in deciding on the duration of glucocorticoid treatment should include the long half-life of mifepristone (85 hours).

	- Treatment with Korlym at a lower dose can be resumed after resolution of adrenal insufficiency. Patients should also be evaluated for precipitating causes of hypoadrenalism, such as infection or trauma.

- **Hypokalemia**: In a study of patients with Cushing's syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with Korlym. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating Korlym. During Korlym administration, serum potassium should be measured 1 to 2 weeks after starting or increasing the dose of Korlym and periodically thereafter. Hypokalemia can occur at any time during Korlym treatment. Mifepristone-induced hypokalemia should be treated with intravenous or oral potassium supplementation as needed.

### Glucocorticoid receptor blockers [^114jGybA]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Mifepristone is the only glucocorticoid receptor antagonist currently approved for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Although originally developed as an abortifacient due to its blockade of the progesterone receptor, a number of case reports have documented its efficacy as a glucocorticoid receptor blocker since 1985. The SEISMIC trial, published in 2012, provided sufficient data on efficacy and adverse effects for regulatory approval. Mifepristone offers clear benefits on glycemia, blood pressure, muscle weakness, body weight, and the other myriad clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome. However, because it blocks the glucocorticoid receptor, blood cortisol and ACTH levels actually rise rather than fall, which complicates patient management. Doses are adjusted based on clinical manifestations rather than hormone levels.

Adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency due to overdosage, hypokalemia, and menorrhagia. The treatment of severe adrenal insufficiency requires high doses of dexamethasone. Other glucocorticoid receptor blockers without effects on the progesterone receptor are being developed. Because mifepristone inhibits CYP3A and CYP2C8/2C9, drug-drug interactions can occur. These potential adverse effects can largely be avoided with careful attention to detail.

My opinion is that its place in therapy is in patients with severe disease and in those not responding to other treatments.

- **Indications and usage**: Korlym (mifepristone) is a cortisol receptor blocker indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery.

- **Limitations of use**: Korlym should not be used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes unless it is secondary to Cushing's syndrome. It is important to note that Korlym should not be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus unrelated to endogenous Cushing's syndrome.

### Global clinical response in Cushing's syndrome patients treated with mifepristone [^116wN971]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Mifepristone was initiated at 300 mg once daily orally and increased in increments of 300 mg daily at Day 14, Week 6, and Week 10 to a maximum of 1200 mg once daily. Investigators could stop escalation based on tolerability and/or if the patient had achieved sufficient clinical benefit at a given dose. The dose could be decreased to manage adverse events (AEs) as previously described. End-points were measured at baseline, Week 6, Week 10, Week 16, and Week 24. These assessments included items from eight broad clinical categories, which were shown in the original Table 1.

- **Cushingoid appearance**: Investigators graded facial plethora, moon-shaped facies, and dorsal cervical fat pad on a 0–3 point scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe at each visit.

- **Interval change assessments**: Assessed on a five-point scale: much improved, somewhat improved, no change, somewhat worse, and much worse.

Other end-point measures have been previously described. An independent, three-member data review board reviewed the clinical data and assessed the overall clinical response. Each board member independently reviewed the data on each visit and compared those findings to the baseline visit; the visits were presented in random sequence, blinded to dose and duration of treatment. Raters scored each post-baseline visit for overall clinical status on a three-point ordinal scale: +1 = clinically significant improvement; 0 = no change; −1 = worse from baseline. The median score of the three raters was used to determine global clinical response (GCR): a median score of +1 at any visit was defined as a positive response.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VLXtt]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of this study was the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome, represented by the pooled percentage of patients reaching normalization of cortisol secretion (as defined by the authors) after medical treatment, patients showing symptom improvement, improved well-being, and improved quality of life. The main analyses were performed in studies reporting on pituitary Cushing patients.

Separate analyses were conducted for publications reporting on:
1. Mixed etiologies other than adrenocortical carcinomas
2. Mixed etiologies including adrenocortical carcinomas
3. Ectopic Cushing only, if sufficient data were available

Studies were categorized according to the type of medical agent: ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone. Studies using more than one of the aforementioned medical agents simultaneously or consecutively were assessed separately.

For normalization of cortisol, all measurements were considered. However, the measurement of urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or morning cortisol following a low-dose dexamethasone test was considered low risk of bias. Data on the reduction of cortisol as a percentage of baseline were not considered for analysis.

Secondary outcomes were the pooled percentages of patients with mild or severe side effects stratified by medical agent. Severe side effects were those that required therapy adjustment or withdrawal, as well as all side effects categorized as severe by the authors. Mild side effects were defined but not fully detailed in the text provided.

### Medical management pathways for Cushing's disease in pituitary tumors centers of excellence (PTCOEs) [^116GYnZS]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

- **Median rates of use of medical treatment options**: Pasireotide and metyrapone therapies were provided in 6 centers with a median rate of use of 18.8% (range: 4.5–51.7) and 29.5% (range: 5.7–50) in those centers, respectively. Data on osilodrostat and cabergoline were available for 4 centers, which used them at median rates of 18.5% (range: 3.4–25) and 9.2% (range: 5.7–33.3), respectively. Five centers reported the use of combination therapy, with a median rate of 25% (range: 10–45.5). The only patient given mifepristone in a single center represented 1.1% of its medically treated population.

- **Median utilization rates of medical treatment options**: Bar graphs show the number of centers that provided specific treatment options. The line graph showed the median utilization rates of each treatment option among centers that provided specific treatment options. Mifepristone is not shown due to its limited use in only a single center.

### Mifepristone treatment of Cushing's syndrome in a pediatric patient [^116GhwGw]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) in the pediatric population is challenging to diagnose and treat. Although next-generation medical therapies are emerging for adults with CS, none are currently approved or used in children. Here we describe the first use of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, to treat CS in a pediatric subject. The patient, a 14-year-old girl with an 18-month history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, suffered from fatigue, profound myopathy, irritability, and depression. She was found to have hypertension, hypokalemia, and worsening control of her preexisting type 1 diabetes.

In this report, we detail our clinical evaluation that confirmed CS caused by an ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting tumor. Surgical and radiation therapies were not pursued because of her poor functional status and limited life expectancy, and medical treatment of CS was indicated for symptom relief. Mifepristone treatment provided rapid improvement in glycemic control, insulin resistance, and hypertension, as well as significant diminishment of her myopathy and fatigue. Hypokalemia was managed with an oral potassium replacement and dose escalation of spironolactone; no other significant adverse effects were observed.

Despite successful palliation of Cushing's signs and symptoms, the patient died of progression of her cancer. This case demonstrates the safety and efficacy of mifepristone treatment in a pediatric patient with symptomatic, ectopic CS. We conclude that, in appropriate pediatric patients with CS, glucocorticoid receptor antagonism with mifepristone is beneficial.

### The treatment of Cushing's disease [^112EzLrW]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), or pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, is a severe endocrine disorder caused by a corticotroph pituitary tumor, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery, which results in disease remission in approximately 78% of patients. However, around 13% of patients experience a relapse within ten years after surgery, resulting in nearly one-third of patients needing additional second-line treatment over the long term.

Patients with persistent or recurrent CD require further treatments, including pituitary radiotherapy, adrenal surgery, and/or medical therapy.

- **Pituitary radiotherapy**: Effective in controlling cortisol excess in a significant percentage of patients, but it is associated with a considerable risk of hypopituitarism.

- **Adrenal surgery**: Provides rapid and definitive control of cortisol excess in nearly all patients but causes adrenal insufficiency.

- **Medical therapy**: Recently gained greater importance due to new compounds that control cortisol secretion or action. It is currently used as a presurgical treatment, particularly for severe disease; as postsurgical treatment in cases of failed or incomplete surgical tumor resection; as bridging therapy before, during, and after radiotherapy while waiting for disease control; and in selected cases as primary therapy, especially when surgery is not an option.

The adrenal-directed drug ketoconazole is the most commonly used drug, primarily because of… (text ends here, indicating truncation).

### Medical therapy for Cushing's disease: Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor blockers [^114GwgD1]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality in Cushing's disease (CD) patients are increased if not appropriately treated. Surgery remains the first-line therapy; however, the role of medical therapy has become more prominent when biochemical remission is not achieved or recurs after surgery, while awaiting the effects of radiation therapy, or when surgery is contraindicated. Furthermore, the use of preoperative medical therapy has also been recognized. In addition to centrally acting therapies, which are reviewed elsewhere in this special issue, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists are frequently used.

A PubMed search of all original articles or abstracts detailing medical therapy in CD, published within 12 months (2013–2014), identified pertinent data. Although not prospectively studied, ketoconazole and metyrapone have been the most frequently used medical therapies. A large retrospective ketoconazole study showed that almost half of the patients who continued on ketoconazole therapy achieved biochemical control and clinical improvement; however, almost 20% discontinued ketoconazole due to poor tolerability. Notably, hepatotoxicity was usually mild and resolved after drug withdrawal.

Etomidate remains the only drug available for intravenous use. A new potent inhibitor of both aldosterone synthase and 11β-hydroxylase, LCI699, following the completion of a phase II study, is being studied in a large phase III trial with promising results. Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been approved for hyperglycemia associated with Cu.

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: A follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^113Ci4Hf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

**Safety**: All patients (n = 29) reported at least one adverse event (AE) during the long-term extension (LTE); the most common AEs reported were nausea (52%), decreased blood potassium (48%), fatigue (45%), headache (38%), and endometrial thickening (35%). Three patients discontinued from the study because of AEs, with one case each of adrenal insufficiency, endometrial thickening, and endometrial disorder. During the LTE, the term "adrenal insufficiency" was used to describe the events experienced by five patients. Three of these events were associated with co-existing infections. The symptoms of "adrenal insufficiency" were effectively managed with the interruption of mifepristone and administration of dexamethasone in four patients, and with the interruption of mifepristone without glucocorticoid supplementation in one patient. Severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mEq/L) was reported in four patients and resolved with treatment that included potassium supplements and mineralocorticoid antagonists. No patients discontinued from the LTE because of hypokalemia.

### Mifepristone treatment in four cases of primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) [^114ckPeP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) is a rare form of adrenal Cushing syndrome conventionally treated with adrenalectomy. Medical treatment is often reserved for patients not eligible for surgery. However, at the time of writing, there have been few studies about the efficacy of mifepristone for the treatment of BMAH associated with hypercortisolism.

The objective of the study was to describe a series of patients with hypercortisolism due to BMAH treated with mifepristone from multiple medical practices. In the study design, four patients treated with mifepristone for hypercortisolism due to BMAH were retrospectively assessed. These patients had either failed unilateral adrenalectomy, declined surgery, or were poor surgical candidates.

Mifepristone induced clinical improvement and remission of the signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism in all described patients with BMAH. The median treatment duration at the time of efficacy response assessment was 5 months (range: 3 to 18 months). Improvement in cardiometabolic parameters was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment was started. All patients achieved improvements in glycemic control and hypertension and had significant weight loss. The most common adverse event observed with mifepristone therapy was fatigue. Increases in TSH levels occurred in two patients.

In conclusion, mifepristone can be an effective medical alternative to surgery in patients with hypercortisolism due to BMAH.

### A new therapeutic approach in the medical treatment of Cushing's syndrome: Glucocorticoid receptor blockade with mifepristone [^1161ZEeS]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a serious endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels. Initial treatment of this condition is dependent upon the cause, but is generally surgical. For patients whose hypercortisolism is not cured by surgery, medical therapy is often required. Drugs that have typically been used for CS medical therapy act by decreasing cortisol levels. Mifepristone is a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist now available for use in patients with CS. Unlike other agents, mifepristone does not decrease cortisol levels but directly antagonizes its effects. Our objective is to review the pharmacology and clinical use of this novel agent and to discuss detailed guidance on the management of CS patients treated with mifepristone.

- **Methods**: We review the literature regarding mifepristone use in CS and recently published clinical trial data. Detailed information related to clinical assessment of mifepristone use, potential drug interactions, drug initiation and dose titration, and monitoring of drug tolerability are provided.

- **Results**: Clinical trial data have shown that mifepristone improves glycemic control and blood pressure, causes weight loss and a decrease in waist circumference, lessens depression, and improves overall wellbeing. However, adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency, hypokalemia, and endometrial thickening with vaginal bleeding. These findings are supported by the earlier literature case reports.

- **Conclusion**: This article provides a review of the pharmacology and clinical use of mifepristone in Cushing's syndrome.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning corticosteroid antagonists, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a corticosteroid antagonist, such as mifepristone, in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy.

### Mifepristone: effect on plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol in term pregnancy [^1147dhgr]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of in vivo mifepristone with placebo on plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol levels in term human pregnancies, this study was conducted.

- **Study design**: In total, 24 women participating in a randomized controlled trial of mifepristone for preinduction cervical ripening were enrolled in this ancillary study. Participants with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies beyond 41 weeks gestation and undilated, uneffaced cervices were randomized to either placebo or mifepristone 200 mg orally and observed for 24 hours prior to receiving either intravaginal misoprostol and/or intravenous oxytocin. Blood samples were obtained before medication administration, 3 and 6 hours later, and then every 6 hours until delivery. Plasma hormone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay.

- **Results**: Basal levels of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol were similar in the placebo (n = 13) and mifepristone groups (n = 11). Compared to placebo treatment, exposure to mifepristone resulted in significant elevation of plasma cortisol within 18 hours. Plasma CRH and ACTH were unaffected. Progression of labor was associated with significant increases in cortisol in both groups, while CRH and ACTH levels were not altered. Compared to basal levels within each group, plasma cortisol at delivery was significantly elevated within both the mifepristone (156.8 ± 17.7 vs 332.6 ± 48.5 ng/ml, p = 0.008) and the placebo (166.6 ± 34.3 vs 342.4 ± 46.4 ng/ml, p = 0.003) groups. However, plasma CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels at delivery did not differ between the groups.

### Global clinical response in Cushing's syndrome patients treated with mifepristone [^114GUSeC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

As previously described, the data review board evaluated, in a blinded fashion, the data from the clinical parameters shown in Table 1. An a priori positive response rate of ≥ 30% was used to test the overall rate of response to mifepristone; if the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval exceeded this threshold, the endpoint was considered statistically significant. Patients with at least 30 days of treatment (n = 46, modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population) were evaluated in analyses of efficacy as previously described. Photographs of 34 consenting patients were available for review. A termination visit was conducted for all patients completing the study as well as for patients with an early termination (ET) date (Week 24/ET, n = 40). Data were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) where indicated. Post hoc analyses were conducted to assess the time course of GCR using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test controlled for non-independence and multiple ratings within patients, and adjusted by the number of degrees of freedom.

The impact of age and gender on response was examined by repeated measures analysis mixed-effects model, and the effect of radiation was assessed using Fisher's exact test. We examined the contribution of predictive factors on GCR in univariate and multivariate models. Factors with meaningful correlations (P ≤ 0.1) were used to build a multivariate regression analysis model. The agreement of raters for visits was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the P value was assigned using Fisher's transformation.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YSmo2]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome due to endogenous glucocorticoid excess is either adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent or ACTH-independent, both with a variety of underlying causes. Cushing's disease results from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and has a reported incidence of approximately 1.2–2.4 patients per million each year. Ectopic Cushing's syndrome is a rare condition resulting from a non-pituitary ACTH-producing source. ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome is caused by a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. An excess of glucocorticoids alters body composition and metabolic profile, inducing fat maldistribution, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulability, and increasing the risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy is a well-established and effective treatment for Cushing's disease. Cushing's syndrome is generally approached by removing the ACTH-producing tumor in ectopic Cushing's syndrome and by adrenalectomy in ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. However, there is increasing experience with first-line medical treatment, both for patients with contraindications for surgery and for patients with persistent disease. Furthermore, drugs can be used to control cortisol secretion preoperatively and to bridge the time period until control of hypercortisolism is achieved by radiotherapy. Drugs used in medical practice vary per country and underlying cause of Cushing's syndrome and include ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone.

### Improvement in insulin sensitivity during mifepristone treatment of Cushing syndrome: early and late effects [^112Z82QQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Increased adiposity and the direct effects of glucocorticoid excess on muscle, liver, and β-cells contribute to the high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes in patients with Cushing syndrome (CS). In the SEISMIC study, the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone improved glucose tolerance and produced weight loss over 24 weeks in CS patients. Using oral glucose tolerance test data from SEISMIC, our goal was to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), β-cell function (insulinogenic index, homeostasis model assessment-β [HOMA-β]), disposition index, weight (WT), and waist circumference (WC) over time. Complete data were available for 19 patients not receiving insulin, 8 of whom had diabetes and/or IGT (C-DM) and 11 with hypertension only (C-HT).

### Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, produces clinical and metabolic benefits in patients with Cushing's syndrome [^115iEZ1U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to prolonged exposure to high cortisol concentrations.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, in endogenous CS.

- **Design and setting**: We conducted a 24-week multicenter, open-label trial after failed multimodality therapy at 14 U.S. academic medical centers and three private research centers.

- **Participants**: Participants included 50 adults with endogenous CS associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance (C-DM) or a diagnosis of hypertension alone (C-HT).

- **Intervention**: Mifepristone was administered at doses of 300–1200 mg daily.

- **Main outcome measures**: We evaluated change in area under the curve for glucose on a 2-hour oral glucose test for C-DM and change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to week 24 for C-HT.

- **Results**: In the C-DM cohort, an area under the curve for glucose (AUC(glucose)) response was seen in 60% of patients (P < 0.0001). Mean ± SD glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased from 7.43 ± 1.52% to 6.29 ± 0.99% (P < 0.001); fasting plasma glucose decreased from 149.0 ± 75.7 mg/dl (8.3 ± 4.1 mmol/liter) to 104.7 ± 37.5 mg/dl (5.8 ± 2.1 mmol/liter, P < 0.03). In the C-HT cohort, a diastolic blood pressure response was seen in 38% of patients (P < 0.05). Mean weight change was -5.7 ± 7.4% (P < 0.001) with a waist circumference decrease of -6.78 ± 5.8 cm (P < 0.001) in women and -8.44 ± 5.9 cm (P < 0.001) in men. Overall, 87% (P < 0.0001) had significant improvement in clinical symptoms.

### Mifepristone effects on tumor somatostatin receptor expression in two patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion [^111zJEeN]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Two patients presented with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion. Initial localization studies included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreoscans ((111)In-pentreotide scintigraphy), which were negative in both patients. They were treated with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, with improvement in their clinical symptoms. Follow-up octreoscans after, respectively, 6 and 12 months showed the unequivocal presence of a bronchial carcinoid in both patients.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to correlate in vivo and in vitro findings in patients with ectopic ACTH-producing syndrome.

- **Methods**: We determined the expression of somatostatin and dopamine receptors by immunohistochemistry (patients 1 and 2), quantitative PCR, and in vitro culturing of tumor cells (patient 1 only).

	- **In vitro results**: Both tumors were strongly positive for somatostatin receptor type 2 (sst(2)) on immunohistochemistry, whereas one of the tumors (patient 1) was also dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D(2)) positive on both immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Octreotide (an sst(2) preferring analog) and cabergoline (D(2) agonist) both decreased the ACTH levels in the cultured tumor cells of patient 1.

- **Conclusion**: We describe two patients with ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoids, in whom a direct down-regulatory effect of glucocorticoid levels on tumoral sst(2) receptor expression is suggested by a remarkable change in octreoscan status after successful mifepristone therapy. Further studies will have to demonstrate whether glucocorticoid influences are consistent.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1119fkhW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning indications for treatment, the Endocrine Society 2015 guidelines recommend avoiding treatments aimed at reducing cortisol levels or blocking the action of cortisol in patients without specific signs of Cushing's syndrome, where only borderline biochemical abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are present. The benefit of treating to normalize cortisol in such settings is not established.

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: A follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^115JknXv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

All numerically continuous data are presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise specified. The percentage change in body weight from baseline was evaluated across time points using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance. No imputations for missing data were performed. Weight loss was evaluated descriptively using a categorical loss of at least 5% of the patient's body weight. A Kaplan-Meier plot was constructed based on the time to achieve weight loss of ≥ 5% in SEISMIC and throughout the LTE. A separate plot was constructed to show time to achieve weight loss of ≥ 10%. Time was right-censored for patients who did not complete the LTE.

Weight loss persistence was defined as a loss of at least 5% of body weight at week 24 of SEISMIC that was maintained to the indicated study visits in the LTE trial. An additional analysis evaluated weight loss of ≥ 10% at week 24 of SEISMIC that was maintained at this threshold to the indicated study visits in the LTE trial. All P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and no Bonferroni corrections for simultaneous multiple inferences were performed. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Successful long-term treatment of refractory Cushing's disease with high-dose mifepristone (RU 486) [^112PvXKn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

An extremely ill patient with Cushing's syndrome caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma experienced complications of end-stage cardiomyopathy, profound psychosis, and multiple metabolic disturbances. Initially treated unsuccessfully by a combination of conventional surgical, medical, and radiotherapeutic approaches, he responded dramatically to high-dose long-term mifepristone therapy (up to 25 mg/kg per day). Treatment efficacy was confirmed by the normalization of all biochemical glucocorticoid-sensitive measurements, as well as by the significant reversal of the patient's heart failure, the resolution of his psychotic depression, and the eventual unusual return of his adrenal axis to normal.

His 18-month-long mifepristone treatment course was notable for the development of severe hypokalemia attributed to excessive cortisol activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor, which responded to spironolactone administration. This case illustrates the efficacy of high-dose long-term treatment with mifepristone in refractory Cushing's syndrome. The case also demonstrates the potential need for concomitant mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in mifepristone-treated Cushing's disease, because cortisol levels may rise markedly, reflecting corticotroph disinhibition, to cause manifestations of mineralocorticoid excess.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^117TJndH]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a corticotroph, adrenocorticotropic-hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Transsphenoidal surgery is the initial treatment of choice in almost all cases. Remission rates for microadenomas are good at 65–90% with an experienced neurosurgeon, but remission rates are much lower for macroadenomas. However, even after postoperative remission, recurrence rates are high and can be seen up to decades after an initial diagnosis. Repeat surgery or radiation can be useful in these cases, although both have clear limitations with respect to efficacy and/or side effects. Hence, there is a clear unmet need for an effective medical treatment.

Currently, most drugs act by inhibiting steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. Most is known about the effects of ketoconazole and metyrapone. While effective, access to ketoconazole and metyrapone is limited in many countries, experience with long-term use is limited, and side effects can be significant. Recent studies have suggested a role for a pituitary-directed therapy with new multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs (e.g. pasireotide, recently approved in Europe for treatment of CD), second-generation dopamine agonists, or a combination of both. Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is another promising drug recently approved by the FDA for treatment of hyperglycemia associated with Cushing's syndrome. We review available medical treatments for CD with a focus on the two most recent compounds referenced above. Our aim is to expand awareness.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VrWC7]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

The sensitivity analyses, both excluding articles with a high risk of bias (n = 18 included) and excluding articles with high and intermediate risk of bias (n = 9 included), showed similar results to the main analysis. The most remarkable difference is that lower percentages of patients with normalization of cortisol were seen for multiple medical agents in both sensitivity analyses compared to the main analysis.

- **Meta-analyses of side effects**:
	- For pituitary Cushing's disease, mild side effects were reported in 39.3% (95% CI 25.0–55.8%) of patients after medical treatment. Patients using mitotane and pasireotide more often showed mild side effects compared to the total population (68.5% and 58.3%, respectively).

	- Severe side effects were seen in 15.2% (95% CI 9.1–22.4%). In the group with mixed etiologies including adrenocortical carcinoma, patients using mifepristone showed severe side effects relatively often (42.0%; 95% CI 30.4–54.0%). Due to severe side effects, 23.9% (95% CI 15.9–32.8%) of patients adjusted their medical therapy, and 8.5% (95% CI 2.8–16.3%) of patients stopped their medical therapy.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VSDbE]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the study, medication can be regarded as a valuable alternative to pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease patients with contraindications to surgery, patients with a recurrence considering repeat surgery, and patients that choose not to undergo surgery. For all other Cushing's disease patients, pituitary surgery remains the first-choice treatment.

For other etiologies of Cushing's syndrome, at present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend when to use medical treatment to lower cortisol levels. However, it suggests that medical agents have similar effectiveness in normalizing cortisol levels for all etiologies of Cushing's syndrome. For a higher chance of treatment success, a different medical agent could be tried if there is no treatment effect or if the patient experiences side effects. There is no evidence for which drug should be used first. Based on the study, mitotane or metyrapone seems to be most effective in normalizing cortisol levels but also causes the highest percentage of patients with side effects.

In conclusion, we consider medical treatment for Cushing's disease a reasonable option in patients with contraindications to surgery, with a recurrence, or who choose not to have surgery. Patients that experience side effects or no treatment effect should be advised to start treatment with a different medical agent to increase the chance of treatment success.

### Holistic burden of illness in patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome: A systematic literature review [^1132noY9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare condition caused by chronic oversecretion of cortisol. The estimated annual incidence is 1.8–3.2 cases per million, with approximately 70% of cases occurring in females. Based on aetiology, CS can be classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent or ACTH-independent. ACTH-independent CS is most commonly caused by a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma, and rarely by adrenal cortical carcinoma, or bilateral disease such as macronodular adrenal hyperplasia or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease. ACTH-dependent CS accounts for 80% of cases and is caused by either pituitary or ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. Cushing's disease (CD), the most common form of endogenous CS, is caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that stimulates the adrenal overproduction of cortisol.

Chronic hypercortisolism can lead to multisystem morbidities due to the ubiquitous downstream effects of cortisol. Patients with CS present with a variety of clinical manifestations of cortisol excess, including mood, reproductive, skin, neurocognitive, and metabolic symptoms, many of which are common in the general population. Treatment options for CS include transsphenoidal surgery as first-line treatment, followed by pharmacotherapy, bilateral adrenalectomy, and pituitary radiotherapy as second-line treatment options. Available medical therapies include steroidogenesis inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, levoketoconazole, etomidate, metyrapone, and osilodrostat) and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. mifepristone).

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: a follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^115QgUvC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Details of the study design and patient population of SEISMIC have been previously published. SEISMIC was a 24-week, open-label, multicenter study of mifepristone administered as a once-daily oral dose to adults with confirmed endogenous Cushing's syndrome who had type 2 diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, or a diagnosis of hypertension and had failed or were not candidates for surgery. Mifepristone was started at a dose of 300 mg/day, with titration to a maximum of 1200 mg/day based on investigator clinical discretion. At the end of SEISMIC, patients underwent a 6-week off-drug safety evaluation period. Of the 34 patients who completed SEISMIC, 30 elected to enroll in the long-term extension (LTE) study. The starting dose in the LTE was the same as the final dose in SEISMIC, with further dose titration at the discretion of the treating clinical investigators. The study designs were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, WA) and an institutional review board at each study center. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for both studies. Patients were free to discontinue from the studies at any time.

This analysis reviews weight assessments taken at baseline and week 24 of SEISMIC as well as at months 6, 12, 18, 24, and the final visit (each patient's last observation) of the LTE study. Waist circumference and body composition were assessed in SEISMIC, but not in the LTE. Safety was assessed throughout the SEISMIC and extension studies via adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical exams, and clinical laboratory tests.

### Efficacy of medical treatment in Cushing's disease: A systematic review [^112HL8Ec]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Reported rates of response to medical therapies used in Cushing's disease (CD) vary widely. The aim of this review is to systematically analyze the efficacy of medical therapies for CD and to assess the strength of the supporting evidence.

- **Methods**: Systematic PubMed searches identified studies of medical treatment in CD. The GRADE criteria were imposed to assess the strength of evidence supporting each medication.

- **Results**: Fifteen studies were included. Ten studies specifically reported response rates for patients with CD. Pasireotide was the only treatment to be assessed in a randomized trial and was supported by a 'moderate' level of evidence. Response rates with pasireotide from three prospective studies were 17–29%. The remaining medications were supported by a 'low' or 'very low' level of evidence. The highest response rates were reported in small retrospective studies of metyrapone (75%, one study) and mitotane (72%, one study). Response rates were 25–50% for cabergoline (four studies) and 45% for ketoconazole (one study). Among studies that included patients with other forms of Cushing's syndrome, response rates were 53–88% for ketoconazole (three studies), 70% for mitotane (one study), 57% for metyrapone (one study), and 38–60% for mifepristone. Again, all of these medications are supported by a 'low' level of evidence.

- **Conclusions**: There is a paucity of high-quality studies of medical therapy in CD, with only one medication achieving a 'moderate' level of evidence. Caution should be employed when comparing efficacy rates owing to the variability in studies.

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: A follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^1165e5vn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity are common among patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) and may persist in some patients even after ostensibly curative surgery, contributing to cardiometabolic dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk. Mifepristone, a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, was effective in controlling hyperglycemia in a 24-week trial of adults (N = 50) with endogenous CS and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension who had failed or were not candidates for surgery (SEISMIC, Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Mifepristone in the Treatment of Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome). This analysis examines long-term weight change among patients who received mifepristone in SEISMIC and enrolled in a long-term safety extension (LTE) study.

- **Methods**: Patients completing the 24-week SEISMIC study and subsequent 6-week off-drug safety evaluation were invited to enroll in the LTE study. Mifepristone doses at the end of SEISMIC were the LTE starting doses. Body weight measures were reviewed at baseline and week 24 of SEISMIC and at LTE month 6, 12, 18, 24, and final visit (last observation collected during the LTE study).

- **Results**: Of the 30 patients enrolled in the LTE, evaluable weight data were available for 29 (20/29 female; mean age of 44.7 ± 11.2 years). These patients received mifepristone for a median of 29.2 months (range 8.4–41.9). Mean ± SD weight from SEISMIC baseline to LTE final visit decreased by 10.3 ± 16.3 kg (mean 105.4 ± 34.3 kg to 95.1 ± 32.9 kg), a 9.3% decrease from baseline weight (P = 0.0008).

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nwuGP]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

In interpreting the results, the following study limitations need to be taken into account. There was a large amount of heterogeneity in included studies regarding the medical agent, etiology of Cushing's syndrome, indication for use of medical therapy for Cushing (presurgical cortisol control, contraindication for surgery, post-surgical therapy failure, or recurrence), outcome measurement (definition of cortisol normalization), and previous use of radiotherapy. Heterogeneity concerning the medical agent and etiology was handled by performing separate analyses per medical agent and per etiology, although this substantially reduced the number of articles in some categories.

Due to heterogeneity regarding outcome measurement for clinical symptoms (difference in blood pressure and glucose vs. number of patients with improved values, only patients with disturbed values at start of the study vs. all patients analyzed), we were unable to perform a quantified analysis of clinical improvement after medical therapy. Included articles showed various levels of risk of bias. However, sensitivity analyses excluding articles with high risk of bias or with high and intermediate risk of bias showed similar results to the main analysis.

For patients with pituitary Cushing's disease, first-line transsphenoidal surgery yields better results than medical therapy, with 80% remission. However, remission following a repeat surgery was shown to be only 42.6–55.7% in a recent meta-analysis. Various complications occurred in up to 18.5% of patients. This underlines that medical treatment is a reason…

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^1151Hz8m]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

The multi-center, open-label, six-month United States SEISMIC study included 50 subjects, 43 of whom had Cushing's disease (CD). Subjects with confirmed endogenous Cushing's syndrome were placed into two groups based on additional eligibility criteria: type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance (C-DM cohort), and hypertension (C-HT cohort). Doses of daily mifepristone ranged from 300 to 1,200 mg, with a mean of 900 mg. Overall, 60% of the 29 patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes were defined as responders (achieving a ≥ 25% reduction in glucose on a standard oral glucose tolerance test from baseline to 24 weeks) with p < 0.0001. There was a continued improvement in glucose tolerance measured at each evaluation at weeks 6, 10, 16, and 24. Of the 12 patients taking insulin at baseline, seven were able to reduce their daily dose by ≥ 50%. Additionally, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c over the course of the study, from 7.43% at baseline to 6.29% at study conclusion (p < 0.001).

Of the 21 patients enrolled in the hypertension group, 38% achieved a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05). Increases or additions of antihypertensive medications were not permitted, except for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Among the 40 patients with hypertension from both groups, 42.5% had a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 5 mmHg, and 52% had either a decrease in diastolic blood pressure or a reduction in antihypertensive medications at week 24. Over half of the patients experienced weight loss of ≥ 5%.

### Mifepristone treatment in four cases of primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) [^111C7gKY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) is a rare form of adrenal Cushing syndrome conventionally treated with adrenalectomy. Medical treatment is often reserved for patients not eligible for surgery. However, at the time of writing, there have been few studies about the efficacy of mifepristone for the treatment of BMAH associated with hypercortisolism.

- **Objective**: To describe a series of patients with hypercortisolism due to BMAH treated with mifepristone from multiple medical practices.

- **Design**: We retrospectively assessed four patients treated with mifepristone for hypercortisolism due to BMAH who had either failed unilateral adrenalectomy, declined surgery, or were poor surgical candidates.

- **Results**: Mifepristone induced clinical improvement and remission of the signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism in all described patients with BMAH. The median treatment duration at the time of efficacy response assessment was 5 months (range: 3 to 18 months). Improvement in cardiometabolic parameters was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment started. All patients achieved improvements in glycemic control and hypertension and had significant weight loss. The most common adverse event observed with mifepristone therapy was fatigue. Increases in TSH level occurred in two patients.

- **Conclusion**: Mifepristone can be an effective medical alternative to surgery in patients with hypercortisolism due to BMAH.

### Cyclic Cushing syndrome: Definitions and treatment implications [^111XDrNE]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) results from hypercortisolemia caused by excess adrenocorticotropic hormone production in a pituitary adenoma or ectopic tumor, or by an adrenal tumor that directly produces excess cortisol. The diagnosis can usually be ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty based on clinical and laboratory findings of hypercortisolism. There are patients, however, in whom the production of excess cortisol exhibits a cyclic or intermittent pattern, and as a result, the clinical symptoms may be quite complex and varied. In these patients, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may be normal between cycles, and dexamethasone suppression testing may produce a paradoxical response.

In the present article, the authors provide a definition of cyclic Cushing syndrome, review the causes and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and discuss the treatment options based on a review of the available literature.

These treatments could be either de novo or for persistent or recurrent disease. Cabergoline was also included as it has been used in multiple investigator-initiated clinical trials for Cushing's syndrome. The medical agents considered were ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone. Articles were excluded if they reported broad inclusion categories without separating subgroups of Cushing's patients or if the study included only children (age < 18 years). To minimize selection bias, at least ten patients had to be included per treatment group. In cases of multiple articles describing overlapping populations, the article with the largest study population was included in the analysis. Articles irretrievable online were requested from the authors. Only English-language articles were considered.

- **Search strategy**: To identify potentially relevant articles, a systematic search was conducted in March 2017 with the assistance of a specialized librarian using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, COCHRANE Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, LWW, and ScienceDirect (see Online Resource 1 for the complete search strategy). The search was repeated in PubMed in May 2017. Additionally, references of included articles were searched to increase the number of potentially eligible articles.

### Improvement in insulin sensitivity during mifepristone treatment of Cushing syndrome: Early and late effects [^113TEp7Y]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

These findings suggest that rapid improvements in insulin sensitivity occurred due to direct effects of glucocorticoid blockade, with longer-term improvements resulting from weight loss. Our data indicate that Cushing's syndrome (CS) patients without underlying impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes experience appropriate reductions in β-cell secretory response in proportion to their improved insulin sensitivity, with insulin secretion decreasing in parallel, resulting in minimal change in the disposition index. However, CS patients with IGT or diabetes exhibit a baseline defect in β-cell secretory responsiveness that is partially retrievable along with improvement in insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by an increasing trend in the disposition index, with mifepristone treatment. Adiponectin levels significantly increased with mifepristone throughout the course of treatment, particularly in patients without diabetes or IGT.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^116TdReV]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a corticotroph, adrenocorticotropic-hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Transsphenoidal surgery is the initial treatment of choice in almost all cases. Remission rates for microadenomas are good at 65–90% with an experienced neurosurgeon. However, remission rates are much lower for macroadenomas. Despite postoperative remission, recurrence rates are high and can be observed up to decades after an initial diagnosis. Repeat surgery or radiation can be useful in these cases, although both have clear limitations in terms of efficacy and/or side effects.

Hence, there is a clear unmet need for an effective medical treatment. Currently, most drugs act by inhibiting steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. The effects of ketoconazole and metyrapone are well-documented. While effective, access to ketoconazole and metyrapone is limited in many countries, experience with long-term use is limited, and side effects can be significant. Recent studies have suggested a role for pituitary-directed therapy with new multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs (e.g. pasireotide, recently approved in Europe for the treatment of CD), second-generation dopamine agonists, or a combination of both. Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is another promising drug, recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of hyperglycemia associated with Cushing's syndrome. We review available medical treatments for CD, focusing on the two most recent compounds referenced above. Our aim is to expand awareness.

### Pharmacological management of severe Cushing's syndrome: the role of etomidate [^111ffmBD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Pharmacological management of Cushing's syndrome (CS) is often instituted in patients who are awaiting the effect of radiosurgery, perioperatively to reduce surgical risk, or as an alternative therapy when other treatment methods have failed or surgery is contraindicated. These drugs target hypercortisolemia at various steps along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and include pituitary-directed agents, adrenostatic agents, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists.

- **Pituitary-directed agents**: These include pasireotide, cabergoline, and temozolomide, which inhibit ACTH secretion, thus preventing the signaling necessary to induce the adrenal cortex to synthesize and release glucocorticoids. Pasireotide and cabergoline have been shown to reduce urinary free cortisol (UFC) in CS patients, while the alkylating agent temozolomide inhibits pituitary corticotroph tumor growth.

- **Glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor antagonist**: Mifepristone reduces hypercortisolemia by preventing cortisol from binding to its receptor and has been demonstrated to improve many of the clinical features of CS, including hyperglycemia and hypotension.

- **Adrenostatic agents**: Ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, aminoglutethimide, and etomidate have long been the mainstay medical treatments for CS, despite none being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the disease. These drugs inhibit one or more steroidogenic enzymes to block cortisol biosynthesis but cannot control the growth of corticotroph pituitary adenomas or restore normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.

### Mifepristone in the treatment of the ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome [^115JjkTT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, can be used to manage hypercortisolism in patients with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome (EAS) when surgical cure is not feasible. Outcomes of EAS patients treated with mifepristone have been limited to reports of isolated cases. We aimed to determine the efficacy and limitations of mifepristone in the treatment of EAS and to compare outcomes with those of patients who underwent bilateral adrenalectomy.

- **Method**: A retrospective cohort study of EAS patients from the University of Michigan between 1997 and 2017 was conducted.

- **Results**: Of the 55 patients with EAS, 16 were treated with mifepristone: eight neuroendocrine tumors, two carcinomas, and six occult tumors. Treatment with mifepristone was most commonly prompted by psychosis, uncontrolled glucose, and/or hypertension. The median maintenance dose was 600 mg/d. Amelioration of psychosis was observed within 48 hours in 3/3 patients, and the glycemic control was improved in 14/16 patients. The median duration of treatment was nine months, and three patients were treated for more than 24 months. The overall survival at 24 months was equivalent between patients with EAS treated with mifepristone versus bilateral adrenalectomy (N = 12) (P = 0.6).

- **Conclusions**: Mifepristone is effective in treating EAS for over two years, and survival was not different from that of patients treated with bilateral adrenalectomy. Aggressive concomitant therapy for hypokalemia and hypertension is necessary.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^113guNEt]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Approaches to medical therapy in Cushing's disease are depicted with compounds listed alongside their main level of action. The interpretation of available data on the efficacy and safety of most drugs currently used in the treatment of Cushing's disease is fraught with difficulties. A review of published reports indicates significant variability in study design, with few small prospective, controlled, randomized studies available. Furthermore, it is unclear whether some studies might reflect publication bias.

There is considerable variation in the biochemical parameters used for primary endpoints, such as urine free cortisol (UFC), serum and salivary cortisol, and plasma ACTH. With few exceptions, reference values derived from sufficiently large populations are largely lacking, particularly for some of the more recently developed assays. Unfortunately, clear criteria for defining effective treatment responses and disease control remain insufficient.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114EtEfs]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

No difference was shown in the normalization of cortisol between patients using medical agents as primary treatment versus secondary treatment, suggesting that the effectiveness of medical agents is independent of other treatment modalities. A higher percentage of patients reach normalization of cortisol in studies where a small portion of included patients received medication preoperatively (including patients with contraindications to surgery and those after previous surgery) than in studies where a large portion of included patients received medication before elective surgery. The most likely explanation is that in patients with planned surgery, medication is given to control cortisol excess, and surgery is performed before complete normalization of cortisol occurs. Unfortunately, the average time until cortisol normalization is unknown since it was not reported by most articles. The total follow-up time was not different for studies with a high percentage of medical pre-treatment before surgery (average 0.1–11.5 years) compared to all included studies.

It would be interesting to know whether the effectiveness of surgery depends on the normalization of cortisol with medical treatment before surgery compared to presurgical medical treatment without cortisol normalization, and compared to no presurgical medical treatment at all. Especially in pituitary Cushing's disease, the percentage of patients with preoperative medical treatment that reaches cortisol normalization is low. This might be due to the higher expectations of surgery in pituitary Cushing's disease compared to other etiologies.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^113NhJ4P]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy involves using a glucocorticoid receptor blocker as a medical approach to treat Cushing's disease (CD). Although hypercortisolemia persists, the devastating effects are mitigated through antagonist binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, comparable to using pegvisomant for acromegaly treatment. Mifepristone is currently the only available glucocorticoid receptor antagonist and directly blocks the cortisol glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) and the progesterone receptor (PR). There are 51 published case reports concerning mifepristone's use in treating hypercortisolism, including five involving CD patients.

Chu et al. presented a case report on a patient with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary macroadenoma who had failed multiple therapies and was too ill for bilateral adrenalectomy. The patient experienced dramatic clinical symptom improvement with mifepristone (starting dose 6 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 25 mg/kg/day) over 18 months. Severe hypokalemia, responsive to spironolactone administration, was attributed to excessive cortisol activation by the mineralocorticoid receptor.

A retrospective report from seven European centers on the use of mifepristone in patients with hypercortisolism includes four additional CD patients. Clinical symptoms improved in three patients during treatment over 3–24 months. The fourth patient demonstrated rapid improvements in psychiatric symptoms after 0.5 months of treatment before undergoing surgery. Severe hypertension and hypokalemia developed in one patient.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113yQJcS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

In specific circumstances related to Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning patients with renal failure, the Endocrine Society 2008 guidelines recommend considering the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. This is suggested as the diagnostic test of choice, rather than urinary free cortisol, in patients with severe renal failure who are suspected of having Cushing's syndrome.

### Improvement in insulin sensitivity during mifepristone treatment of Cushing syndrome: early and late effects [^112mEtfg]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Within-group comparisons for change over time were analyzed with a mixed-effects repeated measures two-way ANOVA with cohort (C-DM and C-HT), time, and cohort by time interaction as fixed effects; unpaired Student t tests were used to assess differences between groups. Matsuda index improved in the total population, with the greatest improvement occurring between baseline and week 6 and lesser changes occurring from week 6 to 24. Further analysis (piecewise linear mixed-model regression) showed a two-phase model (0–6 weeks and 6–24 weeks) for Matsuda index change over time was better than the linear model (P = 0.007; Akaike information criteria). In contrast, WT and WC declined linearly over the 24 weeks, with the largest declines during the final 18 weeks of treatment (baseline to week 6: WT, −1.19 ± 3.17%, P = 0.1; WC, −1.31 ± 3.38%, P = 0.07; week 6 to 24: WT, −6.66 ± 6.52%, P = 0.0003; WC, −6.36 ± 5.83%, P = 0.0002, ANOVA).

At baseline, C-DM patients had compromised insulin secretory responses, as evidenced by lower insulinogenic index 0–30, insulinogenic index 0–120, and HOMA-β. C-HT patients experienced declines in insulinogenic index 0–30, insulinogenic index 0–120, and HOMA-β by week 24, whereas these parameters trended nonsignificantly up in C-DM patients. The disposition index was lower at baseline in C-DM patients than C-HT patients. Individual C-DM patients tended more often to have increases in disposition index than C-HT patients (3.079 ± 4.387 vs. −1.739 ± 5.444, P = 0.063, respectively). Adiponectin levels increased from baseline to completion of the study.

### Global clinical response in Cushing's syndrome patients treated with mifepristone [^112XSk6F]. Clinical endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Patients

The study population consisted of 46 patients (mITT population, n = 32 female and 14 male), including 34 patients who completed the study through to Week 24 of treatment. The baseline characteristics of patients are shown in Table 2. There were 40 patients with Cushing's disease who had failed prior transsphenoidal surgery, including 17 who received prior radiation therapy (34.4 ± 26.2 months [mean ± SD] prior to enrollment). Three patients had ectopic ACTH syndrome, and three had adrenal carcinoma as the cause of CS. Twenty-five of the 46 patients had T2DM and/or impaired fasting glucose (C-DM), while 21 had a diagnosis of hypertension without T2DM and/or IGT. Of the 25 C-DM patients, 19 had coexisting hypertension. At the start of the study, 15 of 25 C-DM patients were receiving antidiabetic medication, and 30 of the 40 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension were taking antihypertensive medication.

### Global clinical response in Cushing's syndrome patients treated with mifepristone [^117RuhJn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to our analysis. This post hoc analysis is subject to bias because it was not a predefined analysis. Although these data should be interpreted with caution, they highlight important performance characteristics of a major study endpoint. The methodology used to determine global clinical response (GCR) was chosen to integrate multiple clinical variables into a single rating to provide a clinically relevant assessment of response to therapy, simulating clinical judgment in a practice situation. This introduces a degree of subjectivity as some endpoints reviewed were semiquantitative or qualitative, such as photographs, and it also reduces statistical power.

The open-label design of the study would potentially make the reviewers more likely to assess a positive GCR at any particular evaluated visit. We believe that such bias was limited because the reviewers were blind to the visit sequence (i.e. duration of treatment and dose) when patient data were reviewed. Clear patient improvement was shown over time when analyzed in chronological sequence. Our use of a stepped approach for the logistic regression method, univariate followed by multivariate, may have led us to miss an interacting variable in the final model. However, other approaches were not appropriate for the small sample size and large number of variables in our data set.

In conclusion, treatment of Cushing's syndrome with mifepristone results in early and progressive clinical improvement in most patients. Strong drivers of clinical response included changes in weight, glucose, blood pressure, and physical parameters.

### Mifepristone treatment in four cases of primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) [^116ZMTg7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

This case series suggests that medical therapy with mifepristone to treat hypercortisolism associated with BMAH is an effective and safe alternative or adjunctive treatment modality to bilateral or unilateral adrenalectomy. Bilateral adrenalectomy (BLA) leads to permanent adrenal insufficiency and the need for lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Patients with adrenal insufficiency are at high risk for potentially fatal adrenal crises. A pooled analysis of 162 patients found persistent adrenal tissue in 23% of patients who have had a BLA. Treatment with unilateral adrenalectomy can result in recurrence of hypercortisolism with rates as high as 67% because of enlargement of the contralateral gland. For some patients, surgery may be high risk, especially for some older adults, whereas other patients may decline surgery for any number of reasons, regardless of associated risk. Moreover, irrespective of the type of surgery, comorbidities stemming from hypercortisolism persist, leading to a poorer quality of life compared with the healthy population.

The literature regarding medical therapy for BMAH is limited. Studies of trilostane, ketoconazole, leuprolide acetate, propranolol, and octreotide LAR reveal a mixed picture, often resulting in no improvement or even worsening of clinical outcomes such as glycemic control and weight gain. Two previous reports (n = 2 patients total) on mifepristone for the treatment of BMAH each demonstrated improvement in Cushingoid features, hypertension, or weight. In our case series, each of the four patients, despite…

A follow-up analysis of clinical trial data found that clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5% of body weight) achieved during short-term mifepristone use was sustained in approximately 80% of patients with Cushing's syndrome who were treated with mifepristone for up to 3.5 years. No new safety signals were detected with long-term mifepristone use.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^115pCKns]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Cushing's syndrome, particularly in patients with epilepsy, the 2008 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend using measurements of cortisol in blood, saliva, or urine as the diagnostic tests of choice. This is particularly relevant for patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome who are receiving antiepileptic drugs known to enhance dexamethasone clearance.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pasXd]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

When comparing different medical agents, it seems that a high percentage of patients with cortisol normalization corresponds to a high percentage of patients with side effects and vice versa. However, all dosages used and studied were within the boundaries advised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This might indicate that advised and commonly used dosages are not, in fact, optimal for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome when considering the balance between treatment effect and side effects.

Furthermore, medical agents with a high percentage of patients with normalized cortisol secretion (mitotane and metyrapone) are relatively often combined with radiotherapy, which may lead to overestimating the effect and side effects of the drug per se. The use of combined medical therapy, either in combination or consecutively, increases the likelihood of successful treatment, i.e. normalizing cortisol levels. This suggests that sensitivity to different medical agents may vary per patient.

### Current management of Cushing's disease [^115nYFv1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a pituitary tumour that secretes adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) autonomously, leading to excess cortisol secretion from the adrenal glands. The condition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality that can be mitigated by treatments resulting in sustained endocrine remission. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (TSS) remains the mainstay of treatment for CD but requires considerable neurosurgical expertise and experience to optimize patient outcomes. Up to 90% of patients with microadenomas (tumour below 1 cm in largest diameter) and 65% of patients with macroadenomas (tumour at or above 1 cm in greatest diameter) achieve endocrine remission after TSS by an experienced surgeon. Patients who are not in remission postoperatively or those who relapse may benefit from undergoing a second pituitary operation. Alternatively, radiation therapy to the sella with interim medical therapy, or bilateral adrenalectomy, can be effective as definitive treatments of CD.

Medical therapy is currently adjunctive in most patients with CD and is generally prescribed to patients who are about to receive radiation therapy and will be awaiting its salutary effects to occur. Available treatment options include steroidogenesis inhibitors, centrally acting agents, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. Several novel agents are in clinical trials and may eventually constitute additional treatment options for this serious condition.

### Medical treatment of Cushing's disease [^117HWV9x]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is associated with serious morbidity and, when suboptimally treated, increased mortality. Although surgery is the first-line treatment modality for CD, hypercortisolism persists or recurs in a significant subset of patients. Considering the deleterious effects of uncontrolled CD, there is a clear need for effective medical therapy.

In this review, molecular targets for medical therapy, efficacy, and side effects of the currently used drugs to treat hypercortisolism are discussed, with a focus on recent developments from translational and clinical studies.

Selection of publications related to the study objective was performed via a PubMed search using relevant keywords and search terms.

- **Main findings**: Medical therapy for CD can be classified into pituitary-directed, adrenal-blocking, and glucocorticoid receptor-antagonizing drugs. Recent studies demonstrate that somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (sst(5)) and dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D(2)) are frequently (co-)expressed by corticotroph adenomas. Pituitary-directed therapy with pasireotide and cabergoline, targeting sst(5) and D(2), respectively, is successful in approximately 25–30% of patients. Adrenal-blocking drugs can be effective by inhibiting steroidogenic enzyme activity. Finally, the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone induces clinical and metabolic improvement in the majority of patients. Each drug can have important side effects that may impair long-term treatment. Generally, patients with moderate to severe hypercortisolism need continued medical management.

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: a follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^115EoyRR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term therapy with mifepristone in patients with Cushing's syndrome was associated with an adverse event profile comparable to that reported in the 24-week SEISMIC study. There were five reported cases of "adrenal insufficiency" during the long-term extension, and all cases resolved with temporary drug interruption, with or without supplemental glucocorticoid administration. Yuen et al. recently described how symptoms of "excessive glucocorticoid receptor antagonism" associated with mifepristone can resemble some symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and low appetite. However, serious symptoms of adrenal crisis, such as hypotension or hyperkalemia, are unlikely to occur due to the rise in cortisol levels and subsequent activation of the mineralocorticoid receptors during mifepristone therapy. If clinical signs or symptoms of excessive glucocorticoid receptor antagonism are suspected, therapy with mifepristone should be discontinued temporarily, and in some cases, the administration of supplemental glucocorticoids may be useful. Treatment can be resumed at a lower dose once signs and symptoms of excessive glucocorticoid receptor antagonism are resolved.

This follow-up analysis of clinical trial data contributes useful information on the long-term use of mifepristone and weight loss in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Other cardiometabolic parameters, such as glycemic control, waist circumference, and blood pressure, were not routinely assessed during the long-term extension, nor did this study control for patient-specific factors such as diet, physical activity, or other lifestyle modifications.

### Sustained weight loss in patients treated with mifepristone for Cushing's syndrome: A follow-up analysis of the SEISMIC study and long-term extension [^111gA2Bb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). High credibility.

Overweight and obesity are common among patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) and may persist in some patients even after ostensibly curative surgery, contributing to cardiometabolic dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk. Mifepristone, a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, was effective in controlling hyperglycemia in a 24-week trial of adults (N = 50) with endogenous CS and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension who had failed or were not candidates for surgery (SEISMIC, Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Mifepristone in the Treatment of Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome). This analysis examines long-term weight change among patients who received mifepristone in SEISMIC and enrolled in a long-term safety extension (LTE) study.

- **Methods**: Patients completing the 24-week SEISMIC study and subsequent 6-week off-drug safety evaluation were invited to enroll in the LTE study. Mifepristone doses at the end of SEISMIC were the LTE starting doses. Body weight measures were reviewed at baseline and week 24 of SEISMIC and at LTE month 6, 12, 18, 24, and final visit (last observation collected during the LTE study).

- **Results**: Of the 30 patients enrolled in the LTE, evaluable weight data were available for 29 (20/29 female; mean age of 44.7 ± 11.2 years). These patients received mifepristone for a median of 29.2 months (range 8.4–41.9). Mean ± SD weight from SEISMIC baseline to LTE final visit decreased by 10.3 ± 16.3 kg (mean 105.4 ± 34.3 kg to 95.1 ± 32.9 kg), a 9.3% decrease from baseline weight (P = 0.0008).
