## Question

Why would food come of the nose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why food would come out of the nose, specifically about nasal regurgitation during eating or drinking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal anatomy and physiology that separate the oral and nasal cavities during swallowing. Then, I should categorize the main etiologies that disrupt that separation, including structural defects, neuromuscular dysfunction, and reflux-related contributors. Next, I will review red flags and associated symptoms that help prioritize the differential. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic and management approach, including when to refer and what tests to consider, and I will verify each step against guideline-level sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the normal mechanism. The velopharyngeal sphincter, formed by the soft palate and lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, must close tightly during deglutition to separate the oral and nasal cavities; failure of this sphincter to seal is termed velopharyngeal insufficiency or incompetence, which allows food or liquid to leak into the nasal cavity during swallowing, producing nasal regurgitation [^111N2m5W] [^116j28Wa].

> Now, I should categorize the causes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to separate structural from neuromuscular etiologies. Structural causes include congenital anomalies such as cleft palate, post-surgical palatal defects, and acquired anatomic changes, whereas neuromuscular causes include cranial neuropathies, neuromuscular diseases, and central nervous system injury. Reflux-related contributions, particularly extraesophageal reflux, can inflame and impair velopharyngeal function, though causation is debated and testing is often nonspecific [^111N2m5W] [^1115aeZx] [^116g2xix].

> I will now examine structural contributors. Cleft palate is a classic cause because the palate fails to fuse, compromising the velopharyngeal valve; breastfeeding guidance for infants with cleft palate specifically addresses techniques to reduce nasal regurgitation, underscoring the anatomic mechanism and its clinical relevance [^112WM45W]. Post-surgical velopharyngeal insufficiency can follow palatoplasty or other pharyngeal surgeries, and maxillomandibular advancement has been associated with transient nasal regurgitation of liquids in a minority of patients, typically resolving over time, which aligns with altered pharyngeal depth and mechanics after surgery [^111N2m5W] [^115VjhYX]. But wait, what if the palate is intact and symptoms persist? I should also consider adenoid hypertrophy and chronic nasal obstruction as contributors that impair velopharyngeal closure and airflow dynamics, especially in children with chronic otitis media with effusion phenotypes, where nasal obstruction and snoring correlate with middle ear disease and may reflect shared nasopharyngeal pathophysiology [^1127zN3V].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular etiologies. Let me consider cranial nerve injuries affecting palatal elevation, such as vagus or glossopharyngeal neuropathies, and broader neuromuscular disorders that impair pharyngeal coordination. Dysphagia guidelines list nasal regurgitation as a cardinal sign of oropharyngeal swallowing dysfunction, reinforcing its significance in neuromuscular disease contexts [^115iemzW]. I need to ensure I also keep neurodegenerative and stroke-related dysphagia on the list, as these frequently manifest with nasal regurgitation due to impaired velopharyngeal timing and strength [^116j28Wa].

> I should double-check reflux-related contributors. Extraesophageal reflux, including laryngopharyngeal reflux, can inflame nasopharyngeal tissues and theoretically impair velopharyngeal closure, but the evidence linking reflux to isolated nasal symptoms is limited and testing lacks consensus; nonetheless, in refractory cases with concurrent throat clearing, hoarseness, or chronic cough, reflux evaluation may be reasonable while acknowledging diagnostic uncertainty [^1115aeZx] [^116g2xix].

> Let me think about associated symptoms that refine the differential. Hypernasal speech, weak pressure consonants, and audible nasal emissions point toward velopharyngeal dysfunction, whereas recurrent aspiration pneumonia, choking, or a wet voice suggest broader oropharyngeal dysphagia. Chronic nasal obstruction, snoring, and otitis media with effusion raise concern for adenoid hypertrophy or biofilm-driven nasopharyngeal disease contributing to impaired mechanics and Eustachian tube dysfunction [^111N2m5W] [^115iemzW] [^1127zN3V].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. New-onset nasal regurgitation in an adult, progressive symptoms, weight loss, aspiration pneumonia, or failure to thrive in children warrant expedited workup for structural lesions, neuromuscular disease, or malignancy. In children, unilateral foul-smelling discharge should prompt evaluation for a nasal foreign body, which, while not a direct cause of food regurgitation, can coexist with obstructive symptoms and secondary infection that complicate swallowing dynamics [^116wjKpC] [^112pDvDA].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm that a careful feeding and swallowing history, speech assessment, and head and neck exam are foundational. Nasopharyngoscopy can visualize velopharyngeal closure during speech and swallow tasks, and videofluoroscopic swallow studies can document nasal regurgitation and aspiration risk, guiding therapy and referrals [^116j28Wa]. Hold on, I should verify adjunct testing: in suspected reflux-predominant cases, pH-impedance or scintigraphy may be considered, but results must be interpreted cautiously given limited specificity for nasal symptoms, and multidisciplinary input from otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, and, when relevant, gastroenterology is often necessary [^1115aeZx] [^116g2xix].

> I will now examine management principles. For infants with cleft palate, feeding modifications and positioning can mitigate nasal regurgitation while definitive palatal repair is planned. For persistent VPI after adequate palatal repair, surgical options such as pharyngeal flap, sphincter pharyngoplasty, or Furlow palatoplasty are tailored to anatomy and speech goals, ideally within a cleft-craniofacial team framework [^112WM45W] [^116j28Wa]. For neuromuscular dysphagia, speech therapy focused on velopharyngeal strengthening and safe feeding strategies, dietary texture modification, and, when indicated, enteral access planning are key; in children with neurodisability, early gastrostomy is favored over prolonged nasogastric tubes for safety and growth outcomes, which indirectly supports stable nutrition while dysphagia is addressed [^115uWX4R]. But wait, what if reflux is suspected to be contributory? A cautious, time-limited empiric reflux regimen may be tried in select cases, recognizing the weak evidence base for reflux as a primary driver of isolated nasal regurgitation and the need to reassess benefit promptly [^1115aeZx] [^116g2xix].

> Let me reconsider the core message to ensure coherence. Food coming out of the nose reflects failure of the velopharyngeal sphincter to separate the oral and nasal cavities during swallowing, most commonly due to structural defects like cleft palate or post-surgical changes, neuromuscular disorders affecting pharyngeal coordination, or reflux-related mucosal inflammation. Careful history, endoscopic and imaging swallow evaluations, and multidisciplinary care allow identification of the cause and targeted interventions ranging from feeding therapy to surgery, with reflux management reserved for appropriately selected cases [^111N2m5W] [^116j28Wa] [^1115aeZx].

---

Food can come out of the nose during eating due to **velopharyngeal insufficiency** (VPI) [^111N2m5W], a failure of the soft palate to seal the nasal cavity during swallowing, often from cleft palate, neurological disorders, or trauma. Other causes include **nasal obstruction** (allergic rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, foreign body) [^116V7vKx] [^116wjKpC], **swallowing disorders** (dysphagia, neurological disease) [^115iemzW], and **reflux-related inflammation** (LPR/GERD) [^1115aeZx]. Evaluation by ENT or speech therapy is recommended to identify the cause and guide management, which may include speech therapy, surgery, or medical treatment of underlying conditions [^116j28Wa].

---

## Anatomical and physiological mechanisms

The **velopharyngeal sphincter** [^111N2m5W], formed by the soft palate and pharyngeal walls, separates the oral and nasal cavities during swallowing; failure to close properly causes nasal regurgitation. The **normal swallowing process** coordinates the tongue, palate, and pharynx to propel food orally while the velopharynx closes to prevent nasal escape [^116j28Wa].

## Common causes of food exiting through the nose

Several factors can disrupt normal swallowing and cause nasal regurgitation:

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|

## Medical conditions associated with nasal regurgitation

Several medical conditions are linked to nasal regurgitation:

- **Cleft palate**: Congenital gap allowing oral-nasal communication [^notfound].
- **Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI)**: Inadequate soft palate closure [^111N2m5W].
- **Neurological disorders**: Stroke, Parkinson's, MS, TBI impairing coordination [^notfound].
- **Swallowing disorders**: Dysphagia and oropharyngeal incoordination [^115iemzW].
- **Reflux-related inflammation**: LPR/GERD causing mucosal irritation [^117Jpoai].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough evaluation is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **Clinical history**: Onset, duration, associated symptoms, medical history [^115iemzW].
- **Physical examination**: Nasal endoscopy, oral cavity inspection, neurological assessment [^116FCuZL].
- **Imaging studies**: MRI, CT, or X-rays to assess structural abnormalities [^1172sPAD].
- **Swallowing assessments**: Videofluoroscopy or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) [^1118SJdX].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include:

- **Speech therapy**: Exercises to improve velopharyngeal function [^notfound].
- **Surgical interventions**: Pharyngeal flap, sphincter pharyngoplasty, or Furlow palatoplasty [^116j28Wa].
- **Medical management**: Treating allergic rhinitis, reflux, or other underlying conditions [^114rNVDH] [^116g2xix].
- **Nasal irrigation**: Saline rinses to reduce obstruction and inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

If untreated, nasal regurgitation can lead to:

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Inhalation of food particles into the lungs [^notfound].
- **Chronic sinus infections**: Persistent nasal irritation and infection [^notfound].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Difficulty eating and maintaining adequate nutrition [^notfound].
- **Social and psychological impact**: Embarrassment, anxiety, and social isolation.

---

Food can exit through the nose during eating due to structural, neurological, or functional swallowing disorders; **accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy** are essential to restore safe, normal swallowing and prevent complications [^116j28Wa].

### Emerging adult and caregiver psychosocial experiences with severe hypoglycemic events and the perceived impact of nasal glucagon: a cross-sectional study [^114sVWPC]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe hypoglycemic events are distressing. Although past studies have shown that young adulthood is a potentially distressing time, few studies have explored distress about severe hypoglycemia in this age group. The real-world psychosocial experiences of potential severe hypoglycemic events and the perceived impact of glucagon treatments like nasal glucagon are currently unknown. We explored perceptions of severe hypoglycemic events and impact of nasal glucagon on psychosocial experiences with these events in emerging adults with type 1 diabetes and caregivers of emerging adults and children/teens. Further, we compared perceptions of preparedness and protection in handling severe hypoglycemic events with nasal glucagon versus the emergency glucagon kit that requires reconstitution (e-kit).

Methods

This observational, cross-sectional study enrolled emerging adults (aged 18–26; N = 364) with type 1 diabetes, caregivers of emerging adults (aged 18–26; N = 138) with type 1 diabetes, and caregivers of children/teens (aged 4–17; N = 315) with type 1 diabetes. Participants completed an online survey about their experiences with severe hypoglycemia, perceptions of nasal glucagon impact on psychosocial experiences, and perceptions of feeling prepared and protected with nasal glucagon and the e-kit.

Results

Many emerging adults (63.7%) agreed that the experience of severe hypoglycemic events was distressing; 33.3% and 46.7% of caregivers of emerging adults and children/teens, respectively, reported distress. Participants reported positive perceptions of nasal glucagon impact, particularly improved confidence in other people's ability to help during severe hypoglycemic events: emerging adults, 81.4%; caregivers of emerging adults, 77.6%; caregivers of children/teens, 75.5%. Participants demonstrated higher perceptions of preparedness and protection for nasal glucagon than for the e-kit (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Participants reported improved confidence in other people's ability to help during severe hypoglycemic events since having nasal glucagon available. This suggests that nasal glucagon may help broaden the support network for young people with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers.

Heat Map of Individual Symptoms Up to Day 25 of SARS-CoV-2 Positive and Negative Respiratory Illness Episodes in Children and Adults

Symptom prevalence refers to the proportion of participants reporting a particular symptom on a given day (calculated as the number of participants reporting a particular symptom divided by the total number of participants completing a diary entry on a given day).

Table 4.
Disease Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2–Positive and SARS-CoV-2–Negative Respiratory Illness Episodes by Age Group

Nasal congestion and/or runny nose with or without cough or fatigue were the 3 most prevalent symptom combinations for both SARS-CoV-2–positive and SARS-CoV-2–negative respiratory illness episodes in both adults (nasal congestion and/or runny nose: 58 of 61 adults [95.1%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 120 of 155 adults [77.4%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection; cough: 49 of 61 adults [80.3%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 80 of 155 adults [51.6%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection; fatigue: 46 of 61 adults [75.4%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 58 of 155 adults [37.4%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection) and children (nasal congestion and/or runny nose: 34 of 40 children [85.0%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 166 of 181 children [91.7%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection; cough: 25 of 40 children [62.5%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 119 of 181 children [65.7%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection; fatigue: 17 of 40 children [42.5%] with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs 69 of 181 children [38.1%] without SARS-CoV-2 infection) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Among adults with SARS-CoV-2–positive episodes, fatigue frequently persisted for 2 weeks or more (Figure panel B). Loss of smell and/or taste was reported by 25 of 61 adults (41.0%) with SARS-CoV-2–positive episodes vs 6 of 155 adults (3.9%) with SARS-CoV-2–negative episodes. In children, this symptom was uncommon in both groups (3 of 40 children [7.5%] with SARS-CoV-2–positive episodes vs 3 of 181 children [1.7%] with SARS-CoV-2–negative episodes). In SARS-CoV-2–positive episodes, adults compared with children younger than 12 years also experienced a higher number of symptoms (median [IQR], 6 [4–8] vs 2 [2–4]; P < .001), a longer duration of symptoms (median [IQR], 13 [8–29] days vs 6 [5–12] days; P < .001), and higher severity of symptoms (median [IQR] maximum severity score, 15 [9–19] vs 6 [4–9]; P < .001) (Table 4; eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^112yBRCP]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Intranasal steroids (INS) for ABRS in children — Adjunct and monotherapy evidence: In a pediatric trial, 89 children with ABRS received amoxicillin — clavulanate and were randomized to budesonide or placebo nasal sprays for 3 weeks, with significant improvements in cough and nasal discharge at the end of the second week in the steroid group; several trials in mixed adult and pediatric populations (usually 12 — 14 years and older) show similar benefits, and therefore there is reasonable evidence to support adding an INS to antibiotics. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients older than 12 years, 200 μg of mometasone twice daily (twice the allergic rhinitis dose) was more effective than placebo and amoxicillin, suggesting some evidence that a high dose of INS in older children might be effective as monotherapy, although generalizing to younger children is not justified without more studies.

### Surgery for velopharyngeal dysfunction [^116j28Wa]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The velopharynx is comprised of complex musculature that works together to achieve closure of the velopharyngeal port during deglutition and speech. Failure of this mechanism results in velopharyngeal dysfunction, manifesting as nasal regurgitation and hypernasal speech. A thorough evaluation with a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngology and/or a surgeon trained in cleft/craniofacial surgery and speech languagy pathology can identify the underlying cause and relevant anatomy, which should be incorporated into decisions regarding surgical techniques. The most common surgical approaches for VPI are pharyngeal flap, sphincter pharyngoplasty, and Furlow palatoplasty, but many alternative techniques can be utilized depending on patient factors and new surgical concepts.

### ABM clinical protocol # 17: guidelines for breastfeeding infants with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate-revised 2019 [^112WM45W]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #17 — parental techniques to assist breastfeeding in infants with cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), or cleft lip and palate (CLP) advise that, in addition to modifying positioning of the infant, parents can implement strategies that are supported by similarly weak evidence (clinical experience or expert opinion). For infants with CL, the parent may occlude the CL with a thumb or finger and/or support the infant's cheeks to decrease the width of the cleft and increase closure around the nipple. For infants with CP or CLP, for infants with CP, it may be useful to position the breast toward the "greater segment" of the palate to facilitate better generation of negative pressure and decrease nasal regurgitation, and the parent may also help to prevent the nipple from being pushed into the cleft site.

### Azelastine hydrochloride (Astelin) [^115a1DSS]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

There have been no reported overdosages with Astelin®Nasal Spray. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of Astelin®Nasal Spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical studies in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse events. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Astelin®Nasal Spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, Astelin®Nasal Spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Oral doses of 120 mg/kg and greater (approximately 460 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children on a mg/m²basis) were lethal in mice. Responses seen prior to death were tremor, convulsions, decreased muscle tone, and salivation. In dogs, single oral doses as high as 10 mg/kg (approximately 260 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children on a mg/m²basis) were well tolerated, but single oral doses of 20 mg/kg were lethal.

### Treatment of the common cold [^1151CgAt]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### Diagnosis and management of primary ciliary dyskinesia [^113PXohG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

ENT

Poor MCC of the upper respiratory tract leads to mucus pooling within the middle ear cleft, nose and paranasal sinuses. This results in a high incidence of otitis media with effusion (46–86% of patients), hearing loss (25–36%) and nasal discharge or blockage (76–88%). Where one would normally expect resolution of glue ear and nasal discharge in an otherwise healthy child by 8 years, symptoms in PCD children persist longer and not infrequently into adulthood.

The main ENT concern is persistent hearing loss that is linked to otitis media with effusion. The role of ventilation tubes (VT) is controversial. Most reports advise avoiding VTs as they simply divert the mucus flow through the ear drum causing longstanding mucopurulent discharge. Hearing loss therefore tends to be managed conservatively with hearing aids, educational support for hearing issues and, where appropriate, speech therapy. Several reports challenge this, claiming good hearing restoration following VT insertion with episodic discharge causing no greater burden than in non-PCD patients. Should tympanic membrane perforations develop (particularly after repeated VT insertion), tympanoplasty is generally successful, but the glue ear often reoccurs.

Nasal symptoms usually manifest as persistent nasal discharge and blockage. Nasal polyposis in childhood is rare. Nasal discharge is best managed by irrigation. Prophylactic antibiotics help minimise infective rhinosinusitis. Rarely is sinus surgery necessary or found to be effective in reducing nasal discharge. The sphenoid and frontal sinuses can be hypoplastic or even aplastic. There is no proven role for the use of intranasal steroids or antihistamines, but they are useful in treating any additional allergic rhinosinusitis.

The role of adenotonsillectomy in removing any reservoir of infection is yet unproven. Obstructive sleep apnoea and sleep-disordered breathing are greater in PCD than in the general population, but neither have been found to be directly linked to increased adenotonsillar hypertrophy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^1172sPAD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Cancer of the Nasopharynx — initial workup and adjunct testing are outlined as follows: H&P including a complete head and neck exam; mirror examination as clinically indicated; nasopharyngeal fiberoptic examination; biopsy of primary site or FNA of the neck; MRI with and without contrast of skull base to clavicle ± CT of skull base/neck with contrast to evaluate skull base erosion; and imaging for distant metastases with FDG-PET/CT and/or chest CT with contrast; bone scan if PET/CT not done. Consider Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)/DNA testing and HPV testing (may inform etiology). As clinically indicated, dental/prosthodontic evaluation, nutrition, speech and swallowing evaluations/therapy, audiogram, consider ophthalmologic and endocrine evaluation, smoking cessation counseling, fertility/reproductive counseling, screening for hepatitis B, and multidisciplinary consultation as clinically indicated are listed. Image-guided (US or CT) needle biopsy of cystic neck nodes may offer better diagnostic yield than FNA by palpation alone for initial diagnosis; for unresectable or metastatic disease where there is a plan for systemic therapy, a core biopsy would allow for ancillary immune-genomic testing. For nonkeratinizing or undifferentiated histology, consider testing for EBV in tumor and blood; common means include ISH for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) or immunohistochemical staining for latent membrane protein (LMP), and the EBV DNA load within the serum or plasma may be quantified using PCR targeting genomic sequences such as BamHI-W, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA), or LMP; these tests vary in their sensitivity, and the EBV DNA load may reflect prognosis and change in response to therapy. H&P should include documentation and quantification (pack years smoked) of tobacco use history, as well as alcohol use and counseling; all patients who currently smoke should be advised to quit smoking, and those who formerly smoked should be advised to remain abstinent from smoking; screen for depression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Diagnosing and managing velopharyngeal insufficiency in patients with cleft palate after primary palatoplasty [^111N2m5W]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Normal speech with velopharyngeal competence (VPC) is possible with an intact palate separating the oral and nasal cavities. The velopharyngeal sphincter, formed by the soft palate, the lateral pharyngeal walls, and the posterior pharyngeal wall, separates the nasal and oral cavities, controls speech resonance, and prevents regurgitation of food and fluid during swallowing. The levator veli palatini, palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus, musculus uvulae, salpingopharyngeus, and superior pharyngeal constrictors participate in the function of the velopharyngeal sphincter. This sphincter controls its shape and size, directing the airflow between the nasal and oral cavities, and must be tightly closed to achieve VPC.

Velopharyngeal dysfunction is a condition where the velopharyngeal valve fails to close properly during the production of oral sounds and has multiple causes, including velopharyngeal insufficiency (anatomic defect preventing velopharyngeal closure), velopharyngeal incompetence (neurophysiologic dysfunction causing poor pharyngeal movement), and velopharyngeal mislearning (nasopharyngeal sound substitution for an oral sound)(Fig. 1). Velopharyngeal dysfunction manifests as a hypernasal resonance, audible nasal emissions, weak pressure consonants, compensatory articulation (including retracted oral articulation, glottal, and nasal or pharyngeal fricatives), reduced speech loudness, and nostril or facial grimacing.

### Determinants of chronic otitis media with effusion in preschool children: a case-control study [^112CS9pv]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Variables with P values over.1 univariably that were not analyzed further were: induced labour, small for gestational age, season of birth, pacifier use, age of solid food introduction, maternal and child supplement use, positive skin prick test, eczema, BMI, and crowding.

Upright bottle-feeding was excluded from further analysis because children with COME are recommended to be bottle-fed upright in NZ. Age at first episode of AOM and age of first starting antibiotics were excluded because AOM is part of the same disease continuum as COME and antibiotics are frequently prescribed for children with OM.

Variables with P values ≤ .1 univariably (Table 1) were analyzed using logistic regression. Those with P values over.05 in the stepwise model that were not entered into the final model were: maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, breastfeeding duration, formula feeding, colic, reflux, parental smoking, childhood use of vitamin C, mouth breathing, full vaccination, probiotic use, wheezing, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, runny nose, and maternal history of OM.

A systematic review concluded that when nasal sinus irrigation was performed regularly over a limited period of up to 7 weeks, there was a positive effect on all investigated outcomes in adults and children with AR, and a 2018 Cochrane review concluded it may reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to 3 months in both adults and children with AR; however, saline nasal irrigation alone is less effective than intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) alone for AR in children.

### Fermented milk consumption and common infections in children attending day-care centers: a randomized trial [^111Kf5nj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

The 3 main categories of common infections were defined as follows:
URTI: Rhinopharyngitis (cold, acute coryza) symptoms including rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, headache, asthenia, sore/stiff muscles, and fever (rare); sore throat including fever, burning throat, painful, red, swollen, bubbling tonsils, and adenopathy with neck pain; sinusitis including headache, sinus pain, stuffy nose, purulent rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and fever; otitis including ear pain, sensation that ear is full, hearing impairment, and discharge.
LRTI: Acute bronchitis symptoms including fever, cough, and mucous or purulent expectoration; flu and flu-like illness including discomfort, intense shivers, high fever, headaches, sore/stiff muscles, arthralgia, asthenia, anorexia, dry, painful cough, and red throat; pneumonia including fever, shivers, chest pain, wheezing, and dyspnea.
GITI (Gastroenteritis): symptoms including fever, headache, sore/stiff muscles, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Quality of life was assessed by using the PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life inventory) questionnaire, composed of 21 items for children ages 2 to 4 years old, and 23 items for children ages 5 to 7 years old. Both sets of items enable the evaluation of 4 dimensions: physical functioning (PF), emotional functioning (EF), social functioning (SoF), and school functioning (ScF). These dimensions are evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100. For all dimensions, a low score corresponds to a poor quality of life. Two summary scores can also be calculated: the psychosocial health summary score (PsyHSS), comprising the emotional, social, and school functioning dimensions, and the physical health summary score (PhyHSS), which is similar to the physical functioning score. The total score takes into account all 4 dimensions.

Compliance was recorded at each visit and was based on information reported in the personal subject's diary. Vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were assessed during the clinical examinations conducted at monthly intervals and at additional visits. Spontaneously reported adverse events were also recorded. Adverse events were defined as any unwanted effect occurring during the clinical study, whether related or not to the study product. The severity of an adverse event was recorded as mild, moderate, or severe.

### Association between inferior turbinate hypertrophy and extraesophageal reflux [^117Jpoai]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Surprisingly, prior studies have included only limited investigations of EER as a potential contributing factor of ITH. Yet it is possible that EER likely plays some role in the pathogenesis of nasal and ear chronic inflammatory conditions, such as chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent otitis media, chronic otitis media with effusion, and others. Notably, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps supports further studies to elucidate the association between EER and chronic nasal inflammatory conditions.

Extraesophageal reflux (also called laryngopharyngeal reflux) is currently defined as an inflammatory condition of the upper aerodigestive tract tissues associated with the direct and indirect effects of gastric or duodenal content reflux, inducing morphological changes in the upper aerodigestive tract. Studies over the past decade have examined the association between EER and chronic rhinosinusitis but not simple turbinate hypertrophy. A potential association among gastroesophageal reflux disease, EER (laryngopharyngeal reflux), and chronic rhinosinusitis has long been suspected in both adults and children. Indeed, Jecker et aldemonstrated that patients with recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis have more laryngopharyngeal reflux complaints, increased esophageal reflux events, and impaired pH-metry findings compared with healthy volunteers. Additional studies have found more hypopharyngeal or nasopharyngeal reflux episodes in patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis and/or early recurrence of nasal polyps after functional endoscopic sinus surgery compared with patients without recurrence. Moreover, Lechien et alconducted a 10-year follow-up of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and demonstrated positive associations among the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease complaints, SNOT-20 scores, and late recurrence of chronic rhinosinusitis requiring functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Overall, the available data suggest an association between EER and severe chronic rhinosinusitis.

### The role of diet in tympanostomy tube otorrhea [^115TYZti]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Children with > 1 TTO episode accounted for 52.5% of this cohort. The present study identifies that children who have ingested the average or higher than average amount of calories as measured by EER% have approximately a 5 to 6 times higher risk of multiple TTO episodes compared to low caloric intake. When looking at specific components of diet (carbohydrates, fats, added sugar, vitamin D), there was no difference between children with and without multiple TTO episodes.

Only 1 prior study has evaluated the role of diet in children with TTO, using a short food questionnaire in almost 300 children. The study evaluated the role of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fruit juice and drinks, sweet tea, diet and regular soda, and dessert intake in TTO. They identified that children with a higher dessert intake (a proxy for sugar and fat) were at higher risk of TTO, compared to those with a lower intake. These findings differ from the present study, as the prior study evaluates children with and without TTO, while this study only evaluated the presence and absence of multiple TTO episodes.

More studies have been performed evaluating the relationship between diet and OM, using multiple methods. Peracchio et al performed a cross‐sectional survey on dietary behaviors, food preferences and OM history in US preschoolers (3‐5 years old) from low‐income families. They reported that children with higher OM rates had a lower preference for vegetables and fruit and with higher preference for foods high in fats and sugar compared to those with lower OM rates. However, they only assessed food preferences and not intake. Another study evaluated the effect of diet on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in Finnish children in daycare. Each family filled out a food frequency questionnaire and the child underwent a nasopharyngeal swab to test for bacteria. They concluded that children with a diet higher in sugar had an increased rate of pneumococcal carriage and those with a higher fruit and berry intake had a lower rate of acute otitis. Moreover, Choi et al used a 1‐day 24‐hour diet recall method within the Korean National Health and Nutritional Exam Survey database to evaluate the association between OM and a higher fat diet in children 4 to 13 years old. They found that a 10% increase in fat intake in healthy‐weight children was significantly associated with a 1.4 higher odds of OM.

### Diagnosis and management of primary ciliary dyskinesia [^112WmZUZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

A high level of suspicion is required to ensure early diagnosis and start of appropriate management before irreversible lung damage sets in. Diagnostic investigations are complex, requiring expensive infrastructure and an experienced team of clinicians and scientists, thus tertiary respiratory centres play an important role, gatekeeping referrals and performing brushings for patients where travel to a diagnostic service is difficult.

European consensus guidelinesreflect a diversity of methods to support diagnosis, with no single 'gold standard' investigation.

History

Paediatricians and neonatologists should have a low threshold to refer patients with symptoms suggestive of PCD (box 1) to a specialist diagnostic centre or to a respiratory centre for further evaluation. Neonates typically present with respiratory distress and rhinitis. Respiratory symptoms are present in 65–87%of neonates and range from mild transient tachypnoea to significant respiratory failure requiring prolonged respiratory support. Unexplained respiratory distress in term neonates, particularly if accompanied by atelectasis, should raise the suspicion of PCD. Although rhinitis is difficult to assess in neonates, in the authors' experience, many parents report that a blocked nose was a problem from soon after delivery.

Box 1
Who should be referred for diagnostic testing?

1. Situs inversus plus respiratory or nasal symptoms
2. Neonatal respiratory distress of unknown cause
3. Sibling with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), particularly if symptomatic
4. **Daily lifelong wet cough (note**: maybe suppressed by child and under-recognised by parents)
5. If considering testing for cystic fibrosis, also consider testing for PCD particularly if rhinitis, sinusitis or glue ear are present
6. Unexplained bronchiectasis
7. Serous otitis media in association with lower and upper airway symptoms
8. Cardiac disease associated with heterotaxy if there is suspicion of respiratory, nasal or ear problems

Variables with P value of.1 or under in univariable analysis

In the final multivariable model (Table 2), Asian ethnicity was inversely associated with COME as compared to European/Other ethnicity (OR: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.07–0.53]). Deprivation was not associated. Long labour (OR: 2.59 [95% CI: 1.03–6.79]), starting cow's milk before 13 months of age (OR: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.05–2.97]), and having a blocked nose (always or often, OR: 4.38 [95% CI: 2.37–8.28]) were significant risk factors. Snoring was associated with COME when compared to never snoring (always, OR: 3.64 [95% CI: 1.51–9.15]) or often (OR: 2.45 [95% CI: 1.04–5.96]) Four or more colds in the last 12 months (OR: 2.67 [95% CI: 1.59–4.53]), siblings with a history of TTP (OR: 2.68 [95% CI: 1.22–6.02]), and number of hours per week at daycare (OR per hour: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.00–1.05]) were all risk factors, and having older siblings was inversely associated (OR: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.31–0.93]).

### Pediatric nasal obstruction [^111mfios]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is one of the most common problems seen by pediatric otolaryngologists. Prompt treatment of nasal obstruction can be critical in newborns and infants because of their obligatory nasal breathing. Older children will typically have more inflammatory, infectious, or traumatic causes of nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction can lead to a significant decrease in the quality of life in children along with an increase health care expenditures.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114rNVDH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal steroids (INS) comparative efficacy and additional effects in allergic rhinitis (AR): Placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the effectiveness of INS in the reduction of nasal symptoms including sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and congestion in adults and children with AR, and by reducing nasal symptoms, INS significantly improve the quality of life and sleep of patients with AR; there are no significant differences in efficacy between the available agents, and along with diminished nasal symptoms, INS have beneficial effects on allergic eye symptoms including itching, tearing, redness, and puffiness; comparative studies show that INS are superior to oral H1 antihistamines in controlling nasal symptoms, including nasal congestion, with no significant difference in the relief of ocular symptoms, and INS are more effective than leukotriene receptor antagonists across the range of allergy symptoms, although intranasal antihistamines have a more rapid onset of action than INS in comparison studies; some studies have also suggested that INS improve asthma control in patients suffering from both AR and asthma, and different preparations of INS can be comparable in efficacy, making sensory attributes important for patient preference and adherence.

### Minimally invasive nasal sampling in children offers accurate pneumococcal colonization detection [^115chTWS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

As we did not perform molecular serotyping in this study, we cannot be certain that the same serotypes were picked up between the 2 sites. However, the good concordance with culture results and correlation between densities at different sites suggest that the same pneumococcal reservoir was sampled by SAM and NPS.

Previously, using the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Challenge model of infection in which healthy adults were challenged with type 6B pneumococcus, detection of pneumococcus in the nose of adults using SAM once Spn colonization was established was low. At day 2 and 6 after 6B exposure, only 1 of 9 (11.1%) and 1 of 7 (14%) Spn-positive adults (carriers by classical culture of nasal washes) was found to be Spn positive by SAM qPCR. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are differences in anatomy, physiology, and nasal/oral microbiome between both groups and the possible change of colonization niche from the nasopharynx to oropharynx in adults. Our findings are in agreement with decreasing sensitivity of nasal swabs, when compared with NPSs, to detect pneumococcal carriage in adults compared with children. The increased presence of pneumococcus in the anterior parts of the nose in children compared with adults could offer an explanation as to why children are transmitting more than adults.

In conclusion, our findings support that SAM sampling is a robust method for accurate detection of pneumococcus in children that could be employed during clinical trials and large epidemiologic studies.

### Glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti) [^114YxPHQ]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.6	Preparation for Nasogastric Tube or Gastrostomy Tube Administration

It is recommended that all patients who can swallow take RAVICTI orally, even those with nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tubes. For patients who cannot swallow, a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube may be used to administer RAVICTI as follows:

Utilize a new dry oral syringe to withdraw each prescribed dosage of RAVICTI from the bottle.
Place the tip of the syringe into the nasogastric/gastrostomy tube.
Utilizing the plunger of the syringe, administer RAVICTI into the tube.
Use a separate syringe to flush the nasogastric/gastrostomy tube. Flush once with 10 mL of water or formula and allow the flush to drain.
If needed, flush a second time with an additional 10 mL of water or formula to clear the tube.

For patients who require a volume of less than 1 mL per dose via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, the delivered dosage may be less than anticipated due to adherence of RAVICTI to the plastic tubing. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored using ammonia levels following initiation of RAVICTI dosing or dosage adjustments.

### The role of food allergy in otitis media with effusion [^111E5WZ3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To detect the relationship between food allergy and otitis media with effusion (OME).

Materials and Methods

This study was performed on three different groups. The patient group was made up of 56 patients with OME (group I). There were 28 patients with food allergy in group II and these patients were investigated for OME. The control group consisted of 28 patients without any complaints concerning food allergy or OME (group III).

Results

Food allergy was detected in 25 patients with OME (44.6%) (group I). In patients with food allergy (group II), OME was detected in 7 patients (25%). In the control group (group III) food allergy was diagnosed in 5 patients (18%) and OME in 1 patient (3%). The incidence of food allergy in OME group was statistically significant when compared to the normal group (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that food allergy may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of OME.

### Nasal decongestants for the common cold [^111o5oTh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, on average affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use.

Search Strategy

In this updated review in 2006, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1996 to September 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1951 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to Week 36, 2006). We contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo controlled trials of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DT and GJL) independently extracted data. All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the objective outcomes.

Main Results

Seven studies in adults, but none in children, fitted all inclusion criteria. There was a small but statistically significant 6% decrease in subjective symptoms after a single dose of decongestant compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. With repeated doses, nasal decongestants produce a very small statistical benefit of 4% over three to five days, again supported by a decrease in nasal airways resistance. Two studies provided safety data for this meta-analysis, showing a relatively small number of adverse events and only a small increased risk of insomnia with pseudoephedrine compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

A single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, and these drugs also provide benefit in some individuals after regular use over three to five days. Adverse events in adults are rare and mild. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years of age with the common cold.

### Local and systemic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults [^113BF4Ga]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children presents with milder disease severity compared with infection in adults. The overall risk of severe COVID-19 in children is even lower than originally believed, with around two deaths per million. The molecular basis of the differences in disease progression between children and adults is not understood and may hold clues for better treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 uses a host cell-surface protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a receptor for cellular entry. Studies suggested that ACE2 expression is both tissue and age dependent, with the highest expression found in nasal epithelium of healthy adultsand comparatively lower expression in paediatric upperand lower airways. These differences were proposed to contribute to reduced disease severity in children, although recent studies have found no correlation with age or infection.

During the initial antiviral immune response, interferon (IFN) is important in inhibiting viral replication, contributing to both innate and cell-intrinsic immunity. Severe COVID-19 in adults has been linked to an impaired antiviral response in the nasal epithelium and blood –, whereas several other studies highlight the contribution of the IFN response to the pathogenesis.

As the virus spreads, 14% of symptomatic, unvaccinated adults develop progressive respiratory failure displaying a strong inflammatory immune response. Single-cell analysis of this response in adults demonstrated the involvement of various immune cell types, including proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages, clonally expanded cytotoxic T cells – and neutrophils. However, the cell-specific immune responses in children have not been comprehensively characterized. Studies comparing bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and cytokine profiles between children and adults suggest a more robust immune response, such as increased levels of IFNγ and interleukin-17 (IL-17A) in the plasma, and a reduced antibody response and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in children. The most recent single-cell transcriptional study analysing the upper airways of children with mild COVID-19 revealed that higher expression of pattern recognition receptor pathways was related to a stronger innate immune response. However, differences in the coordination of local and systemic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults including patients with severe COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.

To address these questions and identify paediatric-specific responses in COVID-19, we collected matched nasal, tracheal, bronchial and blood samples from healthy individuals and patients with COVID-19 from infancy to adulthood and analysed them using single-cell transcriptomics combined with protein profiling.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — pharyngoesophageal and esophageal reflux in relation to nasal symptoms: "Pharyngoesophageal reflux secondary to prematurity or neuromuscular diseases may present as congestion in early life". Broader reflux involvement is noted since "esophageal reflux can cause nasal symptoms in adults and children and may even predispose to obstructive sleep apnea". Related eosinophilic disease is described because "The most common symptom of eosinophilic esophagitis is reflux, and eosinophilic esophagitis is frequently associated with rhinitis and especially symptoms of AR". Evidence and guidance are limited as "Testing for and treatment of reflux in sinonasal disease lacks consensus, and most available data refer to reflux causing pharyngeal and laryngeal disease without focus on isolated nasal symptoms".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^113MpH9P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis — azelastine and olopatadine are both second-generation H1-receptor antagonists with equal efficacy in head-to-head, placebo-controlled comparison studies, and for nasal congestion they are more efficacious than oral preparations. Intranasal antihistamines have a rapid onset of action in the range of 15 to 30 minutes, which is much faster than the oral route (average onset 150 minutes). Olopatadine is FDA approved for seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and in children 6 years and older, azelastine 0.1% is approved for age 6 years and older, and an azelastine 0.15% solution plus sorbitol and sucralose is approved for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and in children 6 years and older. Common adverse events include bitter taste, epistaxis, headache, somnolence, and nasal burning; bitter taste occurs in 2% to 18% with intranasal antihistamines compared with 0% to 0.2% with INS, and somnolence was around 11% in early studies but more recently 0.4% to 3% and equal or only slightly greater than in placebo groups.

Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use.

Search Strategy

In updating this review in 2004, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; MEDLINE (January 1996 to February week 1 2004); EMBASE (1996 to February week 7 2004); and Current Contents (February 2004). We handsearched review citations from other references and contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with placebo of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (DT and GJL). All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. We calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the objective outcomes.

Main Results

Five studies involving 286 adults were included, none in children. There was a significant 13% decrease in subjective symptoms after decongestants were compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. Repeated doses of nasal decongestant were not significantly better than placebo at relieving symptoms of nasal congestion.

Reviewers' Conclusions

A single dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is moderately effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, while there is no evidence available to show benefit after repeated use over several days. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in young children with the common cold.

### Determinants of chronic otitis media with effusion in preschool children: a case-control study [^115QLa7X]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our results support well-established risk factors for COME relating to exposure to infection, specifically URI, daycare attendance, and sibling TTP.

There is growing interest in how respiratory microbiota may support the immune system against conditions such as COME. More investigation is required to confirm whether our results regarding older siblings, prolonged labour (with associated antibiotic use), and the timing of cow's milk introduction reflect effects on the commensal microbiota.

We postulate that biofilms in the nose and nasopharynx link nasal obstruction, snoring, and COME. The child's nose or nasopharynx is first colonized by otopathogenic bacteria that form biofilms. The resulting chronic inflammation may cause nasal obstruction and snoring, but fails to fully suppress the biofilm infection. The otopathogens pass up the Eustachian tube to the middle ear, a risk that is compounded by viral infection, and form biofilms again in the middle ear. This may produce chronic inflammation in the middle ear, i.e. COME. Research on the association between bacterial biofilms in the nose and nasopharynx, nasal obstruction, and COME is required to test this hypothesis.

### Alpelisib (Vijoice) [^111Enx7X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Adult Patients

The recommended dosage of VIJOICE in adult patients is 250 mg orally, once daily, administered as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Pediatric Patients (2 to less than 18 years of age)

The recommended initial dosage of VIJOICE in pediatric patients is 50 mg orally, once daily, administered as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Consider a dose increase to 125 mg once daily in pediatric patients ≥ 6 years old for response optimization (clinical/radiological) after 24 weeks of treatment with VIJOICE at 50 mg once daily. When a pediatric patient turns 18 years old, consider a gradual dose increase up to 250 mg. Recommended dose increases by age group are listed in Table 1.

2.2 VIJOICE Dosage Form Overview

VIJOICE is available in two dosage forms: tablets and oral granules.

Prescribe the most appropriate dosage form of VIJOICE according to the dose required and patient needs.

VIJOICE Tablets (50 mg, 125 mg, and 200 mg) may be administered as:

Whole tablets: For patients who can swallow whole tablets.
Tablets prepared as an oral suspension: For patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

VIJOICE Oral Granules (50 mg per packet):

For patients who are prescribed a 50 mg daily dose only [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
Do not use multiple 50 mg packets or a partial packet of oral granules for patients prescribed a 125 mg or a 250 mg dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Do not combine VIJOICE tablets and VIJOICE oral granules to achieve the prescribed dose.

2.3 VIJOICE Administration Overview

Take VIJOICE with food at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of VIJOICE is missed, it can be taken with food within 9 hours after the time it is usually taken. After more than 9 hours, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take VIJOICE at the usual time.

If the patient vomits after taking the dose, advise the patient not to take an additional dose on that day, and to resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time.

### Nasal disorders [^116V7vKx]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis are common presenting concerns in primary care clinics. Nasal disorders affect the quality of life for many children and families. Rarely, these complaints may represent a life-threatening condition among infant obligate nasal breathers or cases of unusual pathology. The most common causes of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction vary by age and include physiologic, infectious, allergic, foreign body, irritant, and traumatic causes. Less commonly, children may have congenital malformations, sinonasal masses, or autoimmune disease. The most common causes of epistaxis are inflammatory, environmental, and traumatic causes and medication misuse, but rarely, children may have predisposing anatomic, hematologic, or vascular abnormalities or even sinonasal tumors. In this article, we provide a thorough review of the common nasal disorders treated every day in primary care clinics and mention briefly some of the rare but serious cases that may be overlooked without considering a full differential diagnosis.

### Nasalance scores for normal-speaking Turkish population [^1177GBkn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to obtain normative nasalance scores for adult and children subjects speaking Turkish language and obtain a reference for normality when nasality is evaluated.

Methods

Mean nasalance scores were obtained from 35 normal-speaking children aged 7 to 13 years, and 125 adults aged 18 to 69 years during the repetition of 3 nasalance passages that were categorized according to the amount of nasal consonants (oral, oronasal, and nasal passages). The Nasometer (model 6400) was used to obtain nasalance scores for the 3 reading passages.

Results

Group mean ± SD nasalance scores of children for oral passage, oronasal passage, and nasal passage were 15.14 ± 4.81, 37.76 ± 4.42, and 49.23 ± 6.95, respectively. Nasalance scores for the adult group were 13.46 ± 6.26, 37.84 ± 6.13, and 50.28 ± 7.77, respectively. There were significant differences in mean nasalance scores for oral versus nasal materials both for children and adult groups.

Conclusions

The present study provides normative nasalance scores for Turkish-speaking children and adults. The results indicated acceptable differentiation between oral and nasal materials.

### Prevalence of velopharyngeal insufficiency in woodwind and brass students [^116mFzRq]. Occupational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a disorder in which air leaks out through the nose, reducing performance quality and capacity in wind and brass players. There have been limited studies on the prevalence of this potentially career-threatening disorder.

Aims

To identify the prevalence of VPI in a sample of conservatorium level woodwind and brass student instrumentalists in Australia.

Methods

Wind and brass students from four music institutions were recruited by email invitation to complete an online survey. Results from 77 musicians were analysed for their knowledge and experience of VPI. Musicians who had experienced VPI provided information on the characteristics, symptoms and treatment or advice sought for the disorder.

Results

Of the 77 musicians included in the analysis, 44% had heard of VPI, 30% were aware of other musicians who had experienced VPI and 39% had personally experienced VPI.

Conclusions

The results suggest that VPI may be a common occurrence in wind and brass players. Informal discussions with colleagues and music teachers also suggest that VPI is a frequent phenomenon. This group of musicians represents the largest sample surveyed about VPI to date.

### Determinants of chronic otitis media with effusion in preschool children: a case-control study [^1127zN3V]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Frequent nasal obstruction in the last 12 months was reported in 53% of cases compared to 14% of controls, while frequent snoring in the last 3 months was found in 64% of cases versus 30% of controls. Nasal obstruction has been considered to be related to COME only via its associations with allergy and URI, however there is also evidence to support our finding that nasal obstruction and snoring can be associated with OM independently of allergy and colds. Our observation that nasal obstruction was associated with COME independently of rhinitis, atopy, and URI raises the question of what other mechanism could be underlying this relationship. Given the importance of bacterial biofilms in the middle ear in causing COME, a possible explanation is that biofilms in the nose and nasopharynx act as a common factor for both chronic nasal obstruction and COME. In animal models biofilms can spread from the nose to the middle ear, leading to COME. Nasal biofilms are associated with increased nasal resistance, a measure of nasal obstruction. The otopathogen non-typable Haemophilus influenza requires anaerobic conditions to form biofilms, and may therefore be aided by nasal congestion. Although direct evidence that nasal and nasopharyngeal biofilms connect nasal obstruction to COME is lacking, adenoid hypertrophy in particular is a risk factor for nasal obstruction, snoring, and COME, with the preferred explanation being that adenoids can act as a reservoir for otopathogens.

In addition to respiratory factors, we made several findings regarding socio-demographic factors, perinatal factors and feeding practices. Maori and Pacific Island children in NZ are more likely to fail preschool hearing tests. The prevalence of OME in 2 year old Pacific Island children has been measured at 25.4%, however chronicity and other ethnicities were not studied, and subjects were recruited from a less affluent area of Auckland. We did not observe Maori or Pacific Island ethnicities to be risk factors for COME. If a correlation exists, it may be concealed by these families being less likely to attend primary care practices for COME, as our subjects are limited to those referred for surgery.

Asian ethnicity was inversely associated with COME. It is also inversely correlated with a diagnosis of AOM in the US. A longitudinal study could determine whether this reflects a lower likelihood of referral/attendance for TTP surgery, genetic propensity, or cultural differences such as diet, housing, or hygiene practices.

### Virtual dysphagia evaluation: practical guidelines for dysphagia management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [^111CUodz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

With encouraging signs of pandemic containment nationwide, the promise of return to a full range of clinical practice is on the horizon. Clinicians are starting to prepare for a transition from limited evaluation of emergent and urgent complaints to resumption of elective surgical procedures and routine office visits within the next few weeks to months. Otolaryngology as a specialty faces unique challenges when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic due to the fact that a comprehensive head and neck examination requires aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is far from being over and the future may hold other highly communicable infectious threats that may require similar precautions, standard approaches to the clinical evaluation of common otolaryngology complaints will have to be modified. In this communication, we present practical recommendations for dysphagia evaluation with modifications to allow a safe and comprehensive assessment.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^111kvJRE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — selected conditions that may mimic rhinitis identify nasal septal deviation (NSD), nasal valve collapse, and turbinate hypertrophy as common anatomic causes of nasal congestion. NSD is described as a common cause of fixed nasal obstruction that may cause bilateral or unilateral congestion, though the importance and effectiveness of septoplasty for NSD does not appear to be universally accepted. The internal nasal valve is the narrowest portion of the nasal cavity and is responsible for more than two-thirds of nasal airflow resistance; nasal valve collapse refers to weakness or further narrowing that can be perceived as congestion, and examination should note valve patency and any alar collapse, with improvement on the Cottle maneuver suggesting nasal valve pathology. Turbinate hypertrophy can account for severe unilateral or bilateral obstruction; while some causes respond to medical therapy, a surgical approach may be required in others, and treatment in refractory cases can include turbinate reduction, which is often performed at the time of septoplasty for unilateral NSD.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116FCuZL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric rhinosinusitis — presentation and diagnostic considerations emphasize symptom patterns and practical examination limits. As to symptoms, cough is a prominent symptom. The frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children is higher than that in adults and therefore has a greater impact on rhinosinusitis in children. Some younger children might not tolerate nasal endoscopy, and clinicians are sometimes hindered in their physical examination and have to rely on history and on imaging studies for appropriate diagnosis. Unilateral nasal drainage in children should alert the clinician to the possible differential diagnosis of unilateral choanal atresia and nasal foreign body.

### Clinical profile of recurrent community-acquired pneumonia in children [^1118SJdX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aspiration syndrome was diagnosed clinically and confirmed by means of fluoroscopic feeding studies showing oropharyngeal incoordination. Immune function was determined by measuring serum immunoglobulin levels, IgG subclasses, T cell subpopulations, and complement assays. Atopy was diagnosed in the presence of total IgE levels of ≥ 2 standard deviations (SDs) for age and/or allergen-specific IgE for common inhaled and food allergens. The diagnoses of allergy were based on clinical symptoms, skin tests and IgE determinations. Cardiac anomalies were confirmed by means of echocardiography. Chronic rhinosinusitis with post-nasal drip was clinically diagnosed in the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: a mucous or purulent nasal discharge for more than three months, nasal congestion, and posterior nasal drainage; in the case of doubt or the frequent recurrence of pulmonary infections, flexible optical fibre nasal endoscopy and/or paranasal sinus computed tomography were used to confirm the diagnosis and identify any mechanical obstructions of the upper airways. Nasal ciliary function was evaluated by measuring ciliary beat frequency in samples of ciliated epithelium from the inferior nasal turbinate; in patients with two pathological values, a further brushing was taken for ultrastructural analysis by means of electron microscopy. A diagnosis of suspected GERD was based on clinical history and the assessment of symptoms such as regurgitation, nausea, chest and/or abdominal pain, hoarseness and dysphagia; when the diagnosis was doubtful, or in the presence of refractory respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations, the children underwent a 24-hour intra-esophageal pH study. The percentage of body fat was calculated as the body mass index (BMI) SD in accordance with the World Health Organisation child growth standards. Recurrent wheezing in pre-school children was defined as at least three episodes of respiratory tract infections in a period of six months with parental reports of shortness of breath and physician-diagnosed dyspnea. Bronchial asthma in school-age children was diagnosed in the presence of at least two episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, coughing, and pulmonary function test evidence of airflow limitation. Right middle lobe syndrome was defined as atelectasis persisting for more than 4–6 weeks or two or more episodes of consolidation of the right middle lobe.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease in children with chronic otitis media with effusion [^114Fmj2y]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate a possible relation between gastroesophageal reflux disease and middle ear effusion in children.

Methods

Children who came to ear, nose, and throat (ENT) department with the symptoms of hearing loss or aural fullness and diagnosed as OME by examination and tympanometry were included into the study. Children were reviewed gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms including the following: (a) airway symptoms: stridor, frequent cough, recurrent croup, wheezing, nasal congestion, obstructive apnea, hoarseness, and throat clearing; (b) feeding symptoms: frequent emesis, dysphagia, choking: gagging, sore throat, halitosis, food refusal, regurgitation, pyrosis, irritability, failure to thrive, and anemia. Diagnosis is made with at least one positive test of radionuclide gastroesophageal scintigraphy or 24 h pH probe in the patients with reflux. ENT findings were also examined between gastroesophageal reflux disease positive and gastroesophageal reflux disease negative groups.

Results

Approximately 39 (54.9%) of 71 children had at least 1 positive test for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Between the gastroesophageal reflux disease-positive and gastroesophageal reflux disease-negative groups, symptoms of reflux were not significantly different. Two pooled variables were created: airway complex (stridor, frequent cough, throat clearing), and feeding complex (irritability, pyrosis, failure to thrive). Percentage of positive symptom complexes were no statistically different between gastroesophageal reflux disease-positive and gastroesophageal reflux disease-negative groups (> 0.05). Ear, nose, and throat disorders (including rhinitis/sinusitis, adenoid hypertrophy, tonsillitis/pharyngitis, and laryngitis) were more frequent in gastroesophageal reflux disease-positive group. Tonsillitis/pharyngitis was significantly different between the gastroesophageal reflux disease positive and gastroesophageal reflux disease-negative groups.

Conclusions

Upper respiratory tract infections were seen more frequently in gastroesophageal reflux disease positive group. Children who present with gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms are more likely to have a positive gastroesophageal reflux disease test. However, no concordance may be found between the complaints and gastroesophageal reflux disease findings. For this reason, a decision about gastroesophageal reflux disease should not only be made by looking to complaints; diagnostic tests must also be performed.

### Pneumococcal carriage and disease in adults in england, 2011–2019: the importance of adults as a reservoir for pneumococcus in communities [^116yxp81]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Pneumococcal carriage in healthy adults and its relationship to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is not well understood.

Methods

Nasal wash samples from adults without close contact with young children (Liverpool, UK), 2011–2019, were cultured, and culture-negative samples tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pneumococcal carriage in adults 18–44 years was compared with carriage among pneumococcal conjugate vaccine–vaccinated children aged 13–48 months (nasopharyngeal swabs, Thames Valley, UK) and national IPD data, 2014–2019. Age group–specific serotype invasiveness was calculated and used with national IPD data to estimate carriage serotype distributions for ≥ 65 years.

Results

Overall, 98 isolates (97 carriers) were identified (3 solely by PCR) from 1631 ≥ 18 years adults (standardized carriage prevalence 6.4%). Despite different carriage and IPD serotype distributions between adults and children, serotype invasiveness was highly correlated (R = 0.9). Serotypes 3, 37, and 8 represented a higher proportion of adult carriage than expected. Predicted carriage serotype distributions for ≥ 65 years aligned closest with the young adult carriage serotype distribution.

Conclusions

Nasal wash technique is highly sensitive. For some serotypes carried by adults aged ≥ 65 years, other adults may be an important reservoir for transmission. Age groups such as older children should also be considered.

### WITHDRAWN: nasal decongestants for the common cold [^116riy1k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, on average affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use.

Search Strategy

In this updated review in 2006, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2006, issue 3); MEDLINE (January 1996 to September 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1951 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to Week 36, 2006). We contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo controlled trials of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DT, GJL) independently extracted data. All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the objective outcomes.

Main Results

Seven studies in adults, but none in children, fitted all inclusion criteria. There was a small but statistically significant 6% decrease in subjective symptoms after a single dose of decongestant compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. With repeated doses, nasal decongestants produce a very small statistical benefit of 4% over three to five days, again supported by a decrease in nasal airways resistance. Two studies provided safety data for this meta-analysis, showing a relatively small number of adverse events and only a small increased risk of insomnia with pseudoephedrine compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

A single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, and these drugs also provide benefit in some individuals after regular use over three to five days. Adverse events in adults are rare and mild. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years of age with the common cold.

### Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) [^114sn5dT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) are the most common illnesses affecting children. Most illnesses are mild and resolve completely without specific treatment, but the frequency of infection and association with fever and constitutional symptoms creates significant distress for the child and the family. By understanding the evidence available from high-quality studies, the clinician can advise the families on appropriate action. The goal of this article is to support clinicians in answering the following questions: (1) What happened to children with these conditions when no additional treatment was provided? (2) Which interventions have been assessed in well-designed studies? (3) Which interventions have been shown to improve outcomes? (4) How large is the overall benefit?

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD foundation consensus recommendations based on state of the art review [^111zUTJa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Other Chronic Respiratory Conditions to Consider

The clinical symptoms associated with PCD often overlap with other common pediatric and adult respiratory diseases (Table 6). Each of these other diseases should be considered in patients with chronic oto‐sino‐pulmonary symptoms; however, investigations should only be pursued when the clinical picture suggests their presence. Thus, PCD is not a diagnosis of exclusion.

Table 6
Other Chronic Respiratory Conditions to Consider When Considering a Diagnosis of PCD

Sweat testing or cystic fibrosis genetic testing are recommended when evaluating patients for PCD, as both diseases can present with similar phenotypes 83 and produce nNO levels below the PCD diagnostic cutoff of 77 nl/min. 58 Immunodeficiency can also present similarly to PCD, 84 and in patients with suspected PCD, laboratory studies investigating immunodeficiency are necessary. Preliminary study of nNO in certain humoral immunodeficiencies has shown normal values well above 77 nl/min, 85 but further study is required to know if all forms of immunodeficiency produce normal nNO levels.

Pulmonary aspiration, with or without gastroesophageal reflux, can cause chronic respiratory symptoms in adults and children, including cough, wheeze, bronchitis, or pneumonia. 86, 87 Thus in patients with possible PCD, a thorough feeding history is essential. A history of chronic cough from asthma can also resemble PCD in young children, especially with frequent viral infections from daycare exposures. Additionally, chronic nasal congestion from allergic rhinitis can seem similar to PCD rhinosinusitis. However, PCD nasal disease is present year‐round and does not resolve with seasonal change, as often occurs with allergic rhinitis. Lastly, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a disorder of preschool aged children causing > 3 weeks of wet cough with lower airway bacterial infection and airway neutrophilia. 88 In general though, the characteristic, year‐round, daily, often wet or productive cough of children with PCD usually distinguishes them from these other conditions.

### Determinants of chronic otitis media with effusion in preschool children: a case-control study [^111bsxJj]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To address the many inter-related factors associated with COME, we included a comprehensive set of variables in our regression analysis. In addition to well known risk factors such as frequent URI, daycare attendance, and sibling history of TTP, we also identified some respiratory risk factors that were independently associated with COME, notably nasal obstruction and snoring. Prenatal and perinatal events also appear to impact the risk of COME in preschoolers, including long labour and early introduction of cow's milk.

URI is a frequently observed risk factor. In animal models, bacteria in the nose are more likely to ascend to the middle ear if respiratory viruses are also present. Our finding regarding URI may reflect viruses acting as a compounding risk factor through polymicrobial interactions with bacteria in the nose and nasopharynx.

Daycare attendance exposes children to infection that can lead to COME. Children congregating at daycare increases the transfer of viruses, and the transmission of bacteria that may survive in a biofilm state in mucous secretions on toys and other surfaces. Sibling TTP being a risk factor may reflect shared family environment including parental healthcare practices, awareness of COME, or exposure to the same pathogens. It may also indicate familial predisposition, which is a risk factor supported by a number of twin studies, however a history of maternal OM was not significant in the multivariable analysis.

Reports as to whether atopy and allergic rhinitis are risk factors for OME are mixed. We did not find atopic diseases to be risk factors for COME. The discrepancy among studies could be explained by blocked nose or URI acting as confounders, as these conditions are associated with both allergic conditions and COME. We used a validated questionnaire for rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema and asthma, which may have improved our specificity in identifying allergic diseases.

### Treatment of the common cold in children and adults [^116VmkaT]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The common cold, or upper respiratory tract infection, is one of the leading reasons for physician visits. Generally caused by viruses, the common cold is treated symptomatically. Antibiotics are not effective in children or adults. In children, there is a potential for harm and no benefits with over-the-counter cough and cold medications; therefore, they should not be used in children younger than four years. Other commonly used medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisolone, and Echinacea, also are ineffective in children. Products that improve symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, Pelargonium sidoides (geranium) extract, and buckwheat honey. Prophylactic probiotics, zinc sulfate, nasal saline irrigation, and the herbal preparation Chizukit reduce the incidence of colds in children. For adults, antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, codeine, nasal saline irrigation, Echinacea angustifolia preparations, and steam inhalation are ineffective at relieving cold symptoms. Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, inhaled ipratropium, and zinc (acetate or gluconate) modestly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms for adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some herbal preparations, including Echinacea purpurea, improve symptoms in adults. Prophylactic use of garlic may decrease the frequency of colds in adults, but has no effect on duration of symptoms. Hand hygiene reduces the spread of viruses that cause cold illnesses. Prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduces cold symptom duration in adults and children.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^112b2X1r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or in shortening of illness duration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. We also followed up references in identified papers. We appealed for further articles at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections (1997). We corresponded with experts and got in touch with pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children.

Data were extracted by two reviewers and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review.

Main Results

We included thirty two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the eleven trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extend nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. It is however not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^112pDvDA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — nasal foreign bodies clinical features, burden, risks, and removal: These "are common among young children", and "Most cases present with unilateral congestion and foul-smelling purulent rhinorrhea". Burden is substantial because "Foreign bodies are estimated to account for 30% of ear, nose, and throat emergencies of which 19% are intranasal". Complications occur since "Complications of nasal foreign bodies include infection, nasal perforation and epistaxis", with heightened concern that "button batteries… can be corrosive and lead to septal perforation". Management can be complex because "Removal may require general anesthesia, especially in cases of prolonged impaction because of associated inflammation".

Table 2
Identified syndromes among 38 children with concomitant anomalies

Table 3 shows a descriptive list of the diagnosed concomitant congenital anomalies. The most common early cleft-related complication in this study was feeding difficulties and malnutrition (underweight for age) 51 (29%), with 3 children requiring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tubes. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections occurred in 9 (5%) children. Late complications were persistent speech challenges 16 (9%), neurodevelopmental delay because of malnutrition (underweight) and failure to thrive 13 (7%), and persistent nasal regurgitation of meals 4 (2%).

Table 3
Descriptive list of concomitant congenital anomalies by system

Anaesthetic technique was general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation for all children. Co-induction was done with sevoflurane, propofol and fentanyl for all except one. The majority were intubated with a direct laryngoscope, with 138 (79%) successful first attempts, 18 (10%) were difficult intubations (3 or more attempts) and 4 (2%) had planned video laryngoscopy because they were already predicted difficult airways. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. A single child with congenital myopathy received trigger-free anaesthesia, with propofol and remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia. Analgesia was multimodal with intravenous agents such as acetaminophen, ketamine, fentanyl, and magnesium sulphate. Some received rectal acetaminophen. In addition, 58 (33%) had local anaesthetic (xylocaine) infiltrated by the surgeons, whilst 17 (10%) had peripheral nerve blocks with bupivacaine.

Predominantly, unilateral cleft lip repairs were performed [70 (40%)], followed by first-stage palate repair [64 (37%)], then bilateral cleft lip repair [15 (9%)]. The rest were cleft nose repair [11 (6%)], second stage palate repair [10 (6%)], oronasal fistula repair [2 (1%)], and lip and revision procedures [2 (1%)].

Postoperative complications occurred in 11 (6%) children, with a total of 25 events (Table 4). One patient bled in recovery, requiring reintubation and surgical relook. The early postoperative anaesthetic complications were respiratory 10 (6%), with one requiring reintubation, and cardiovascular collapse [1 (0.6%)]. Intensive care admission was required for 6 (3%) of the children, and all had complex multiple congenital anomalies.

Perceived Impact of Nasal Glucagon Availability on Psychosocial Experiences with Severe Hypoglycemic Events

Perceived Impact of Nasal Glucagon on Distress

Nearly half (49.7%) of emerging adults perceived improvements in the distress or worry they felt about experiencing a severe hypoglycemic event since adding nasal glucagon (i.e. reduced distress; Fig. 3). A total of 48.1% and 50.7% of caregivers of emerging adults and children/teens, respectively, reported these improvements.

T1D type 1 diabetes

Perceived Impact of Nasal Glucagon on Ease of Treatment

A majority of emerging adults (73.8%) felt that having nasal glucagon available would improve the ease of treating a severe hypoglycemic event. Both groups of caregivers reported feeling that the ease of treating a severe hypoglycemic event improved since adding nasal glucagon (79.0% and 74.5% of caregivers of emerging adults and children/teens, respectively; Fig. 3).

Perceived Impact of Nasal Glucagon on Confidence in Others to Help

Most (81.4%) of emerging adults indicated that their confidence in other people's ability to handle a severe hypoglycemic event had improved a little or a lot since adding nasal glucagon. Both groups of caregivers reported improved confidence in other people's ability to handle a severe hypoglycemic event (77.6% and 75.5% of caregivers of emerging adults and children/teens, respectively) since adding nasal glucagon (Fig. 3).

### The impact of primary ciliary dyskinesia on the upper respiratory tract [^115Sxofz]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition affecting the function of motile cilia. The upper respiratory tract is lined with ciliated epithelium and hence a hallmark of PCD is the development, from the neonatal period onwards, of persisting secretion retention and suppurative infection in the middle ear, nose and facial sinuses [1]. This review aims to remind the clinician involved in the care of a patient with PCD of the complexities of making the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and chronic otitis media with effusion (ChOME), the morbidity associated with CRS and ChOME and of current evidence of best practice for the management of these conditions.

### WITHDRAWN: antihistamines for the common cold [^112uQxt6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or the shortening the duration of illness.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2002, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specilaized Register; MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003); and EMBASE (1987 to December 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and trial authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized.

### Otitis media with effusion in children [^111DMZrm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of children have been affected by otitis media with effusion (OME) by the age of 4 years, but prevalence declines beyond 6 years of age. Non-purulent middle-ear infections can occur in children or adults after upper respiratory tract infection or acute otitis media. Half or more of cases resolve within 3 months and 95% within 1 year, but complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea, and cholesteatoma can occur.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent otitis media with effusion in children? What are the effects of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical interventions to treat otitis media with effusion in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found one systematic review and one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adenoidectomy, antibiotics, antihistamines, autoinflation, bottle feeding, decongestants, exposure to other children, intranasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, oral corticosteroids, passive smoking, and ventilation tubes.

### Chronic stridor in a toddler after ingestion of a discharged button battery: a case report [^113os8gM]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Button battery (BB) ingestions (BBI) are increasingly prevalent in children and constitute a significant, potentially life-threatening health hazard, and thus a pediatric emergency. Ingested BBs are usually charged and can cause severe symptom within 2 h. Discharged BBs ingestion is very rare and protracted symptom trajectories complicate diagnosis. Timely imaging is all the more important. Discharged BBs pose specific hazards, such as impaction, and necessitate additional interventions.

Case presentation

We present the case of a previously healthy 19-month-old girl who was admitted to our pediatric university clinic in Germany for assessment of a three-month history of intermittent, mainly inspiratory stridor, snoring and feeding problems (swallowing, crying at the sight of food). The child's physical examination and vital signs were normal. Common infectious causes, such as bronchitis, were ruled out by normal lab results including normal infection parameters, negative serology for common respiratory viruses, and normal blood gas analysis, the absence of fever or pathological auscultation findings. The patient's history contained no evidence of an ingestion or aspiration event, no other red flags (e.g. traveling, contact to TBC). Considering this and with bronchoscopy being the gold standard for foreign body (FB) detection, an x-ray was initially deferred. A diagnostic bronchoscopy, performed to check for airway pathologies, revealed normal mucosal and anatomic findings, but a non-pulsatile bulge in the trachea. Subsequent esophagoscopy showed an undefined FB, lodged in the upper third of the otherwise intact esophagus. The FB was identified as a BB by a chest X-ray. Retrieval of the battery proved extremely difficult due to its wedged position and prolonged ingestion and required a two-stage procedure with consultation of Ear Nose Throat colleagues. Recurring stenosis and regurgitation required one-time esophageal bougienage during follow-up examinations. Since then, the child has been asymptomatic in the biannual endoscopic controls and is thriving satisfactorily.

Conclusion

This case describes the rare and unusual case of a long-term ingested, discharged BB. It underscores the need for heightened vigilance among healthcare providers regarding the potential hazards posed by discharged BBIs in otherwise healthy children with newly, unexplained stridor and feeding problems. This case emphasizes the critical role of early diagnostic imaging and interdisciplinary interventions in ensuring timely management and preventing long-term complications associated even to discharged BBs.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^112pC53D]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — prevalence and quality-of-life burden reports that allergic rhinitis (AR) affects up to 60 million people in the United States annually and is often associated with asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and sleep disturbances; self-reported AR prevalence is 10% to 30% of adults and as many as 40% of children in the United States, physician-confirmed rates were 14% of US adults and 13% of US children, and Canadian data support up to 20% physician-diagnosed AR; chronic nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) has been estimated to affect 17% to 52% of adults and up to 34% of patients with rhinitis may have mixed rhinitis; quality-of-life issues include disturbed sleep, daytime somnolence and fatigue, irritability, depression, impairment of physical and social functioning, and attention, learning, and memory deficits, and Thirty-five percent to 50% of adults reported that nasal allergies have at least a moderate effect on their daily life, with sleep disturbances including difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and awakening refreshed.

### Local and systemic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults [^114YYDmE]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Distinct changes in children and adults

We next examined gene expression changes in children versus adults, in healthy individuals, patients with COVID-19 and patients after COVID-19. In nasal epithelial cells, the biggest changes were observed for gene expression signatures associated with IFNα signalling (Fig. 2b). Healthy adults had the lowest IFNα response that was strongly induced in COVID-19 and returned to preinfection levels in patients after COVID-19. In children, this gene signature was already activated and increased only slightly after infection. These patterns were repeated for signatures of IFNγ response, TNF signalling and neutrophil migration, albeit with smaller fold changes. For nasal immune cells, the induction of the IFNα response signature was higher in children than in adults. The other signatures examined also showed greater induction in children than in adults.

Examining these responses by cell types in healthy children versus adults, the IFN response signatures were already activated in children across several epithelial cell types, with the highest levels in goblet inflammatory cells, Hillock precursors and rare melanocytes (Fig. 2c; absolute values per cell type are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5c). However, SARS-CoV-2-induced IFN responses were higher in adults across many epithelial cell types. Many immune cell types in healthy children had elevated IFN response signatures compared to adults, particularly CD56 lo natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, neutrophils, CXCL10 + monocytes and some CD8 + T cell subsets for IFNα, and a wider range for IFNγ (Fig. 2d). After infection, we observed a greater induction of these responses in immune cells in children, most prominently in monocytes, including in the already expanded IL6 + monocytes, CD4 CCR4 + T cells and T follicular helper cells.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^112iGQYW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Cough and rhinitis — Chronic cough is often defined as persisting for > 4 weeks in children or > 8 weeks in adults, and in immunocompetent nonsmokers is usually due to upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, with UACS the most common cause. In allergic rhinitis (AR), cough is frequent: in 1 large multinational observational study, 47% of patients with AR frequently reported cough, although only 11% cited cough as the main reason for seeking medical attention. Management complexity may be increased because up to 23% of patients with chronic cough have at least 2 contributing comorbidities. Additional observations include that cough sensitivity has been described to be heightened in patients with AR both during and outside pollen season, and that cough in AR is frequently related to concomitant asthma or nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity, often undiagnosed.

### Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, maxillomandibular advancement, and the velopharynx [^115VjhYX]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) symptoms and the associated changes of the velopharyngeal anatomy in patients who underwent maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) for persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP).

Methods

Preoperative and postoperative cephalometric radiographs were analyzed to assess the anatomic changes of the velopharynx. In addition, a questionnaire survey was sent to the patients between 6 to 12 months after MMA. The questionnaires evaluated the presence and extent of VPI symptoms, including nasal regurgitation while eating or drinking as well as hypernasal speech. A 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS 0–10) was included to assess the impact of VPI symptoms on the patient's quality of life. In the patients who reported VPI symptoms, telephone interviews were conducted 1 year after the survey to evaluate the changes in VPI symptoms over time.

Results

Fifty-two of the 65 questionnaires were returned. Five patients (9.6%) reported nasal regurgitation of liquids when drinking hastily, with 2 patients reporting the occurrences as occasional and 3 patients reporting as rare. The impact of these symptoms on the patient's quality of life was minimal (VAS 0.6 ± 0.4). Regurgitation of food or hypernasal speech was not reported. The telephone interviews 1 year later revealed that the symptoms have completely resolved in all 5 patients. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative cephalometric radiographs demonstrated the pharyngeal depth increase was 48% of the amount of maxillary advancement and the functional pharyngeal length increased 53% of the maxillary advancement. The functional depth of the pharynx after MMA was significantly greater in the patients with VPI symptoms (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that patients who undergo MMA for persistent OSA after UPPP have a low risk of developing VPI. If symptoms occur postoperatively, they are mild and have minimal effect on the patient's quality of life; moreover, the symptoms usually resolve over time.

Gastrostomy feeding access and timing — A gastrostomy tube or "button" is recommended for long-term enteral nutrition, and nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are not used long-term; earlier placement is associated with better growth outcomes. Specifically, "A gastrostomy tube or 'button' is recommended for long-term enteral nutrition because it is more comfortable for the child and is less easily dislodged than a nasogastric tube", while "Nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are not used long-term because they may be dislodged easily, may stiffen and cause intestinal perforation, or may result in nasal congestion, sinusitis, otitis media, and skin and mucosal irritation". "The best clinical response is seen in children with the shortest time between the neurological insult and gastrostomy placement with refeeding". "Children who have gastrostomies placed within the first year of life are more likely to exceed the fifth percentile for height and weight", and "Gastrostomy feedings initiated within 1 year of the neurological insult are associated with improved weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and length-for-age". In contrast, "Nutritional intervention initiated 8 years after the neurological insult does not improve length-for-age, despite improvement in weight-for-age".

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^113tGeSk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty controversies and challenges — The narrative describes variability in goals and techniques, diverse anatomic problems addressed, and areas to optimize perioperative care and patient selection. Variability exists in rhinoplasty goals and techniques, depending on factors such as patient preference and facial features, and rhinoplasty addresses myriad anatomic problems including dorsal humps, bulbous nasal tips, twisted noses, tip rotation, nasal valve compromise, and projection concerns. A growing body of evidence supports methods to optimize care in the perioperative period, and areas to expand the evidence base include preoperative physical and psychosocial evaluation, perioperative medication administration for bleeding, swelling, infection, and pain, and use of supporting materials such as nasal grafts and splints. The text notes opportunities to optimize pre- and postoperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), states that rhinoplasty can be of tremendous benefit toward improving self-esteem among those concerned about nasal appearance, and advises that physicians counseling preoperatively must consider patient expectations and motivations. It further states that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) commonly manifests with nasal concerns and that patients with BDD are best served with other treatments, as opposed to surgery.
