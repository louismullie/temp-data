## Question

Spironolatone

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spironolactone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and core pharmacology. Then, I should verify labeled indications and dosing. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence by indication, including heart failure, resistant hypertension, primary aldosteronism, edema, and dermatologic uses. After that, I need to check safety, monitoring, and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing pearls and highlight controversies or gaps where my initial assumptions might be wrong and need correction.

> Let me first confirm the basics: spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that competitively blocks aldosterone at the distal nephron, promoting natriuresis and potassium retention; it is both a diuretic and an antihypertensive, with active metabolites contributing to prolonged effect, and food increases bioavailability, so consistency with meals matters for exposure [^acbdfa0b] [^ed646006].

> I need to verify labeled indications and typical dosing ranges. The FDA labeling includes heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, essential hypertension as add-on therapy, edema from cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, and primary hyperaldosteronism for preoperative control or long-term maintenance when surgery is not feasible; usual hypertension dosing is 25–100 mg daily, with doses above 100 mg rarely adding benefit, and HF dosing typically starts at 25 mg daily with careful titration and monitoring [^755ae6f9] [^47a26ca0] [^94f2ec33].

> Now, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: I should confirm the magnitude and quality of benefit. The RALES trial in NYHA III–IV HFrEF showed a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 30% reduction in cardiac hospitalizations with spironolactone 25 mg daily on top of ACE inhibitors and loop diuretics; this is high-certainty evidence and supports a strong recommendation for use in appropriate patients with close monitoring [^12303b2b] [^33a1a088].

> For heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. TOPCAT did not meet its primary composite endpoint, but there was a significant reduction in heart failure hospitalizations and signals of benefit in the Americas cohort; post hoc analyses suggest greater benefit at lower LVEF within the preserved range and a sex-specific mortality reduction in women, so guidelines give a cautious IIb recommendation with emphasis on careful selection and monitoring rather than routine use [^013850de] [^b16e3a41] [^39c46f69] [^0f736d3b].

> Next, resistant hypertension: I should double-check the comparative effectiveness. PATHWAY-2 demonstrated that spironolactone 25–50 mg daily as the fourth agent outperformed placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin for home and clinic systolic blood pressure, with an average reduction around 10–12 mmHg and a low rate of serious adverse events; VA/DoD and ACC/AHA guidelines endorse spironolactone as preferred fourth-line therapy in the absence of contraindications [^5fed1f71] [^2643586f] [^0b80121b] [^0c3e2361] [^d5c4cb88].

> Primary aldosteronism: let me verify dosing strategy and relative roles of MRAs. Guidelines recommend starting low, often 12.5–25 mg daily, and titrating to effect while monitoring potassium, creatinine, and renin; spironolactone is generally preferred over eplerenone due to cost and availability, though eplerenone may be chosen for tolerability, and amiloride is a reasonable alternative when MRAs are contraindicated or not tolerated; typical maintenance ranges span 50–200 mg, with some patients requiring up to 400 mg in select cases [^417643eb] [^ad26b796] [^f01f1c36] [^01fc4f46] [^2f991616].

> For edema in cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, I should confirm dosing and safety context. Initial doses of 100 mg daily are standard in cirrhosis, with stepwise titration every 72 hours to a maximum of 400 mg if needed, and inpatient initiation with slow titration is advised; spironolactone is particularly useful when hypokalemia complicates other diuretic therapy, but close monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal function is essential [^ecb791cd] [^432821c9].

> Dermatologic indications are largely off-label; I need to check the highest-quality evidence. The SAFA randomized trial in adult women with acne showed clinically meaningful improvements in acne-specific quality of life and higher treatment success versus placebo with 50–100 mg daily, supporting its use as an alternative to antibiotics; for hirsutism and female pattern hair loss, evidence is more limited and largely observational, though anti-androgenic effects are biologically plausible and guideline bodies increasingly recognize its role in selected patients [^1a296059] [^71364c5e] [^f2968bad] [^75799988].

> Safety and monitoring: I should confirm the key risks and practical cadence. Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function are the primary concerns, with risk rising in CKD, diabetes, and when combined with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium supplements; start low, recheck potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change, and adjust frequency based on renal function and concomitant drugs; gynecomastia and menstrual irregularities are dose-related and more common with spironolactone than eplerenone, and men may experience sexual dysfunction; in stage 3b CKD, a recent RCT showed no outcome benefit and frequent discontinuations, so routine use for cardioprotection alone is discouraged unless there is another indication [^47a26ca0] [^13bc335c] [^c8ac0cb5] [^63ac9cd1].

> Special populations and contraindications: I need to ensure I flag these clearly. Avoid spironolactone in pregnancy, severe renal impairment, or baseline potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L; in eGFR 30–50, consider every-other-day dosing and closer labs; in dialysis, very low doses may be used with vigilant potassium monitoring; for transgender hormone therapy, spironolactone is commonly used as an anti-androgen, but this is off-label and requires shared decision-making and monitoring [^47a26ca0] [^77cb4579] [^8a175f71] [^a7d046c4].

> Practical pearls: let me reconsider a few nuances that often trip clinicians up. First, there is no clear dose-response for hypertension above 100 mg daily, so escalating beyond that rarely helps and increases adverse effects; second, in PA, suppressed renin can guide adequacy of blockade, but interpretation is trickier when patients are on multiple agents; third, real-world HFpEF data suggest potential benefit in those with resistant hypertension, but this remains hypothesis-generating and should not override neutral RCT results; finally, if hyperkalemia limits MRA use, a potassium binder like patiromer can enable continuation in selected high-risk patients, though outcome data are pending [^94f2ec33] [^417643eb] [^260e9839] [^7e56c17b].

> In summary, spironolactone is a cornerstone therapy for HFrEF, the preferred fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension, a first-line medical therapy for primary aldosteronism, and a validated alternative for women with moderate acne; benefits must be balanced against hyperkalemia, renal function effects, and sex hormone–related adverse effects, with dosing individualized and monitoring prioritized to maximize net clinical benefit [^12303b2b] [^5fed1f71] [^417643eb] [^1a296059].

Spironolactone is a **potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist** used for heart failure, resistant hypertension, primary aldosteronism, and edema from cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome [^755ae6f9] [^432821c9]. It **reduces mortality and hospitalizations in HFrEF** [^12303b2b] and is the preferred fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension [^5fed1f71] [^0c3e2361]. Common adverse effects include hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and menstrual irregularities; monitor potassium and renal function, especially with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or NSAIDs [^47a26ca0] [^13bc335c]. Start low and titrate slowly to minimize hyperkalemia and renal impairment [^ffd8a3a9].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Competitive aldosterone antagonism at mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal nephron, causing sodium and water excretion with potassium retention [^acbdfa0b].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Oral absorption ~90%; protein binding > 90%; hepatic metabolism to active metabolites (e.g. canrenone); half-life ~1.4 hours for parent drug, 13–24 hours for metabolites [^ed646006].

- **Onset/duration**: Diuretic effect in 2–3 days; full effect in 2–3 weeks; duration 2–3 days after discontinuation.

---

## Clinical indications

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Heart failure (HFrEF) | NYHA class III–IV, LVEF ≤ 35% | 25 mg daily; titrate to 50 mg if tolerated [^47a26ca0] |
| Resistant hypertension | Uncontrolled BP despite ≥ 3 agents | 25–50 mg daily [^5fed1f71] [^d5c4cb88] |
| Primary aldosteronism | - Preoperative control <br/> - Long-term therapy if surgery not feasible | 100–400 mg daily [^47a26ca0] [^54cd9e89] |
| Edema (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) | Refractory ascites or edema | 100–400 mg daily [^ecb791cd] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **HFrEF**: RALES showed 30% mortality reduction and fewer HF hospitalizations [^12303b2b].

- **Resistant hypertension**: PATHWAY-2 showed superior BP control vs placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin [^5fed1f71] [^2643586f] [^0b80121b].

- **Primary aldosteronism**: Controls BP and corrects hypokalemia; preferred MRA due to cost and availability [^ad26b796] [^fae663a0].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Hyperkalemia**: Dose-related; higher risk with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, or renal impairment [^47a26ca0] [^13bc335c].

- **Endocrine effects**: Gynecomastia, breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities, decreased libido [^63ac9cd1].

- **Renal impairment**: Risk of worsening function, especially in CKD; monitor closely [^c8ac0cb5].

- **Other**: Gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, rash, rare hepatotoxicity.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Baseline and periodic**: Serum potassium, creatinine/eGFR, and BP.

- **High-risk patients**: Start low (12.5–25 mg) and titrate slowly; consider every-other-day dosing in CKD [^77cb4579].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid with potassium supplements, other potassium-sparing diuretics, and use caution with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and NSAIDs [^13bc335c].

---

## Special populations

In **chronic kidney disease**, use cautiously and monitor potassium and renal function frequently; consider alternatives if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In **pregnancy**, avoid use due to potential fetal harm. In **pediatrics**, safety and efficacy are limited; use only when clearly indicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **HFrEF**: Strong recommendation (class I) in NYHA III–IV with LVEF ≤ 35% [^notfound].

- **Resistant hypertension**: Preferred fourth-line agent (weak recommendation) [^0c3e2361].

- **Primary aldosteronism**: Suggested MRA due to cost and availability (conditional recommendation) [^ad26b796].

---

## Recent developments

Recent developments include the **CLEAR trial**, which found no benefit of spironolactone after MI with PCI, limiting routine post-MI use [^ca50cce6]. Nonsteroidal MRAs such as finerenone are emerging for CKD and HFpEF with fewer hormonal side effects [^c8ac0cb5] [^9f1acb92].

---

Spironolactone is effective for HFrEF, resistant hypertension, and primary aldosteronism, but requires **careful monitoring** for hyperkalemia and renal effects; start low, titrate slowly, and avoid in high-risk combinations.

## References

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^9819cf89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.

Objectives

Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality, morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to determine if there is a blood-pressure lowering dose response with spironolactone.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95%CI:16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95%CI:4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. There may be a dose response effect with spironolactone up to 50 mg/day, but the confidence intervals around the mean end-of-study blood pressure for doses ranging 25–500 mg/day all overlapped. In other words, it appears that doses > 50mg/day do not produce further reductions in either SBP or DBP. One cross-over study found that spironolactone 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly change SBP or DBP compared to placebo, SBP: -9.9 (95%CI:-21.15,1.35); DBP -2.34 (95%CI:-7.92,3.06).

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited available evidence, spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary (essential) hypertension when doses of 100–500 mg/day are given. A dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, compared to placebo. Given the lack of a dose-response, coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses, doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. There is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^417643eb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism-specific therapy — panel recommendation and MRA dosing: The panel issued a conditional recommendation for the use of PA-specific therapies over nonspecific antihypertensive treatments, and the risk of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) side effects can be minimized by commencing at low doses (eg, 12.5–25 mg of spironolactone daily) and increasing the dose gradually (eg, every 2–3 months or sooner if clinically indicated) as required to control BP; measurement of renin during MRA titration can assist treatment decision making, but this is less straightforward if the individual is on other medications that affect renin levels.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ad26b796]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — choice of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability. The recommendation is driven by the availability and low cost of spironolactone over other MRAs; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating primary aldosteronism, and MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred; when initiating an MRA, consider hypertension severity for dosing and potential discontinuation of other antihypertensive medications, and monitor potassium, renal function, renin (concentration or activity), and blood pressure response during follow-up to guide MRA dose titration.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^dd7414e5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — justification for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist selection emphasizes that, despite legitimate concerns about spironolactone tolerability, there is no scientific basis from efficacy studies to recommend an alternative MRA as first-line therapy to replace spironolactone, while shared decision making allows for use of a non-spironolactone MRA where desired.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5 Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer spironolactone in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, spironolactone can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fae663a0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with PA receiving specific medical therapy due to its low cost and widespread availability.

### Spironolactone [^891d9a21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was time to all-cause mortality. Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

### Complications of inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure: when an old medicine spirals out of new guidelines [^d972f77a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to investigate the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) in clinical practice.

Background

Spironolactone was reported by one prospective randomized trial to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV HF. With this report (Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study [RALES] trial), we noted a marked increase in widespread use of spironolactone in patients with HF. Long-term outcome data with respect to safety and utilization of this medication in HF are not available.

Methods

To investigate the use of spironolactone for HF in a clinical setting, we analyzed the application of the RALES trial protocol to the care of 104 patients, whom we identified as being started on spironolactone for HF after prerelease of the RALES trial.

Results

We found broader use, less intensive follow-up, and increased complications with spironolactone treatment compared with the RALES trial. Cardiologists provided more appropriate care than did primary care providers.

Conclusions

These data suggest that spironolactone is being used widely in HF without consideration of the NYHA class and ejection fraction, and without optimization of background treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Clinical follow-up does not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in higher complications. We conclude that long-term studies with further safety and efficacy data are needed.

### The effect of spironolactone use on heart failure mortality: a population-based study [^d0a6776d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone use for heart failure (HF) has increased dramatically after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study trial; yet, few studies have examined its real-world impact. We aimed to determine the population effect of spironolactone use on mortality in HF patients discharged from hospital.

Methods and Results

All patients discharged alive between October 1997 and December 2001 in Nova Scotia, Canada, with a primary diagnosis of HF were enrolled in the Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes Study. Two year, all-cause mortality was the primary end point. A total of 7816 patients were identified, of whom 644 (8%) were discharged home on spironolactone. After adjusting for differences in clinical covariates, spironolactone use did not emerge as an independent predictor of long-term survival (OR 0.97, P = 0.80). When only the subgroup of patients enrolled in a HF clinic were included (n = 990), spironolactone use was associated with reduced rates of all-cause mortality at 2 years (OR 0.52, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Although spironolactone use was not associated with improved long-term survival in the general HF population, it was associated with improved long-term survival in patients enrolled in HF clinics. These data highlight the challenges of knowledge translation from a clinical trial into practice.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4dee926d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — research considerations identify gaps including determining the benefit of MRA treatment versus other nonspecific antihypertensive treatments in individuals with increased ARR but negative suppression tests, assessing efficacy of nonsteroidal MRAs and aldosterone synthase inhibitors compared with spironolactone in PA and in low-renin or elevated-ARR individuals not meeting diagnostic criteria, evaluating novel screening strategies outside the ARR, and the feasibility of a gold-standard randomized controlled trial comparing standard versus PA-specific medical therapy for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^5fed1f71]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the trial question was: what is the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 274 placebo (matching placebo daily for 12 weeks). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 4.1 mmHg; AD 8.7 mmHg, 95% CI 7.69 to 9.72). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 4.2 mmHg; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 10.8 mmHg; AD 9.92 mmHg, 95% CI 8.59 to 11.3). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2f991616]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Justification for Recommendation 10 states that although the evidence is limited and indirect, amiloride seems to be as effective as spironolactone in reducing BP in individuals with resistant hypertension and both drugs are low cost and both improve QOL; nevertheless, there is a lack of direct clinical evidence to recommend ENaC amiloride over MRA spironolactone as first-line therapy, and an MRA should be the preferred treatment in PA based on a small study of 10 individuals in which spironolactone (400 mg/day) had greater BP-lowering effects than amiloride (40 mg/day); when spironolactone is not tolerated and other MRAs are not available, amiloride may be an alternative therapy in the management of PA.

### Routine spironolactone in acute myocardial infarction [^ca50cce6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR (spironolactone) was published by Sanjit S Jolly and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with myocardial infarction? In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the population was: 7062 patients (1438 female, 5624 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; SBP < 90 mmHg; active diarrhea; known allergy or contraindication to everolimus; unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy; contraindication to spironolactone; cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease. In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the interventions were: n = 3537 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily) n = 3525 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF (1.7/100 py vs. 2.1/100 py; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, new or worsening HF, or death from cardiovascular causes (7.9% vs. 8.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.81 to 1.13) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (3.2% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.27) No significant difference in new or worsening HF (1.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.16). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death from renal causes, dialysis, renal transplantation, or a sustained drop of at least 40% in the eGFR. significant difference in gynecomastia (2.3% vs. 0.5%). In the CLEAR (spironolactone) study, the conclusion was: in patients with myocardial infarction who had undergone PCI, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or new or worsening HF.

Regarding medical management for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (particularly spironolactone in low to moderate doses) in patients with bilateral disease (such as idiopathic/bilateral adrenal hyperplasia). Monitor potassium and creatinine, especially if combined with ARBs or ACEis.

Primary aldosteronism medical therapy — cost and tolerability considerations indicate markedly lower costs for spironolactone vs eplerenone, with newer mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) drugs likely to have the highest costs; in models where lifelong MRA treatment is needed without surgery, medication costs are expected to rapidly dominate, and individual preference is important due to tolerability and side effect concerns beyond cost alone.

### Spironolactone, eplerenone and the new aldosterone blockers in endocrine and primary hypertension [^9f1acb92]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are commonly used to reduce blood pressure, left-ventricular hypertrophy, and urinary albumin excretion in patients with essential hypertension or primary aldosteronism. Effects of MRAs on hypertensive organ damage seem to occur beyond what is expected from the mere reduction of blood pressure. This suggests that activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor plays a central role in the development of cardiac and renal abnormalities in hypertensive patients. However, broad use of classic MRAs such as spironolactone has been limited by significant incidence of gynecomastia and other sex-related adverse effects. To overcome these problems, new aldosterone blockers have been developed with different strategies that include use of nonsteroidal MRAs and inhibition of aldosterone synthesis. Both strategies have been designed to avoid the steroid receptor cross-reactivity of classic MRAs that accounts for most adverse effects. Moreover, inhibition of aldosterone synthesis could have an additional benefit due to blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor-independent pathways that might account for some of the untoward effects of aldosterone. The new aldosterone blockers are currently having extensive preclinical evaluation, and one of these compounds has passed phase 2 trials showing promising results in patients with primary hypertension and primary aldosteronism. This narrative review summarizes the knowledge on the use of classic MRAs in hypertension and covers the evidence currently available on new aldosterone blockers.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^37f96ca5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Benefits and harms summarize indirect evidence showing similar blood pressure effects of spironolactone and amiloride in resistant or low-renin hypertension, with reports that results showed similar BP-lowering effects of spironolactone and amiloride and that in a double-blind crossover trial spironolactone and high-dose amiloride had similar antihypertensive effects, and several smaller studies also found they were similarly effective at lowering BP; however, in supranormal aldosterone secretion effects of spironolactone were better than those of amiloride and in volume-dependent hypertension spironolactone and triamterene reduced BP with spironolactone having greater effects; when spironolactone is not tolerated these studies suggest ENaC inhibitors as a viable substitute, and both amiloride and spironolactone equally improved quality of life in individuals with PA; in small PA-specific data, low-dose amiloride controlled BP within 1 to 4 weeks of initiation with effects sustained for up to 20 years.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^be0960e2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) medical therapy — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) selection: In individuals with primary aldosteronism (PA) receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability (2 | ⊕⊕OO). The recommendation is supported by evidence that a systematic review identified 7 randomized controlled trials (n = 229) and 1 comparative observational study (n = 188); meta-analysis concluded that eplerenone, compared with spironolactone, was associated with a higher number and dosage of antihypertensive agents, with no statistically significant differences in achieving BP control, control of hypokalemia, and SBP level. Regarding tolerability, spironolactone has far greater ability to block androgen action and affect progesterone action than eplerenone, and indirect data show male gynecomastia incidence 7.9% vs 0.6% among placebo users (OR: 8.39 [5.02–13.99]) and relative odds for male gynecomastia of 8.44 (3.9–18.2) for spironolactone vs 0.77 (0.31–1.88) for eplerenone.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^2643586f]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the trial question was: is spironolactone superior to add-on bisoprolol in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 285 bisoprolol (at a dose of 5 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 10 mg/day through week 12). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.3 mmHg; AD 4.48 mmHg, 95% CI 3.46 to 5.5). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 8.4 mmHg; AD 5.98 mmHg, 95% CI 4.51 to 7.45) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 16.3 mmHg; AD 4.45 mmHg, 95% CI 3.11 to 5.8). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to bisoprolol with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### Spironolactone vs amiloride for resistant hypertension… [^df06cedf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Amiloride was noninferior to spironolactone in lowering home SBP, suggesting that it could be an effective alternative for treatment of resistant hypertension. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04331691. At week 12, mean home SBP decreased by
13. 6 mm Hg and 14. 7 mm Hg in the amiloride and spironolactone groups, respectively. No significant between-group difference was observed in the change in mean home SBP. Second, amiloride was not inferior in terms of target SBP achievement rate after 12 weeks of treatment. Third, low-dose spironolactone and amiloride both showed meaningful BP lowering in participants with resistant hypertension, demonstrating an excellent safety profile and tolerability.

Fourth, spironolactone tended to show better efficacy with decreasing renin and increasing aldosterone to renin ratio, whereas the efficacy of amiloride was consistent regardless of renin and aldosterone-renin status. Spironolactone, unlike doxazosin and bisoprolol, reduced thoracic fluid overload. 10 Thus, the efficacy of spironolactone can be attributed to its ability to block excess aldosterone and reduce fluid volume. 8 However, spironolactone can lead to poor adherence owing. This study used lower doses of spironolactone and amiloride, compared with those used in the PATHWAY-2 study, because low-dose spironolactone has been shown to effectively lower BP while minimizing adverse effects. In an uncontrolled study by Nishizaka et al, 25 low-dose spironolactone administered to participants with resistant hypertension resulted in a mean SBP reduction of 25 mm Hg and a mean diastolic BP reduction of 12 mm Hg at 6 months. SBP reduction of 21.

9 mm Hg and a mean diastolic BP reduction of
9. 5 mm Hg. 26 Regarding hyperkalemia, the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study reported a 5% incidence of hyperkalemia with spironolactone, 12. 5 mg/d.

### A double-blind, randomized study comparing the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone and spironolactone in patients with hypertension and evidence of primary aldosteronism [^f7428c04]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone is claimed to be a more selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor than spironolactone being associated with fewer antiandrogenic side-effects. We compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eplerenone versus spironolactone in patients with hypertension associated with primary aldosteronism.

Methods

The study was multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, and parallel group design. Following a single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized 1: 1 to a 16-week double-blind, treatment period of spironolactone (75–225 mg once daily) or eplerenone (100–300 mg once daily) using a titration-to-effect design. To be randomized, patients had to meet biochemical criteria for primary aldosteronism and have a seated DBP at least 90 mmHg and less than 120 mmHg and SBP less than 200 mmHg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone versus spironolactone to establish noninferiority of eplerenone in the mean change from baseline in seated DBP.

Results

Changes from baseline in DBP were less on eplerenone (-5.6 ± 1.3 SE mmHg) than spironolactone (-12.5 ± 1.3 SE mmHg) [difference, -6.9 mmHg (-10.6, -3.3); P < 0.001]. Although there were no significant differences between eplerenone and spironolactone in the overall incidence of adverse events, more patients randomized to spironolactone developed male gynaecomastia (21.2 versus 4.5%; P = 0.033) and female mastodynia (21.1 versus 0.0%; P = 0.026).

Conclusion

The antihypertensive effect of spironolactone was significantly greater than that of eplerenone in hypertension associated with primary aldosteronism.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^1a296059]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SAFA was published by Miriam Santer and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: Acne vulgaris. In the SAFA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in female patients with acne vulgaris? In the SAFA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SAFA study, the population was: 410 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult female patients with facial acne for at least 6 months, judged to warrant oral antibiotics. The key exclusion criteria were Investigator's Global Assessment acne score of 0–1; previous use of spironolactone; use of oral isotretinoin in the past 6 months; use of oral antibiotics for > 1 week for acne within the previous month. In the SAFA study, the interventions were: n = 201 spironolactone (50 mg/day until week 6, increasing to 100 mg/day until week 24) n = 209 placebo (matching placebo). In the SAFA study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12 (19.2 points vs. 17.8 points; AD 1.27 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46). In the SAFA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 24 (21.2 points vs. 17.4 points; AD 3.45 points, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.75) Significant increase in self-assessed overall improvement score of 3–6 at week 24 (82% vs. 63%; OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.93) Significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for treatment success at week 12 (19% vs. 6%; OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.28). In the SAFA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue. significant differences in at least one adverse reaction (64% vs. 51%), headache (20% vs. 12%). In the SAFA study, the conclusion was: in adult female patients with facial acne for at least 6 months, judged to warrant oral antibiotics, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^c8ac0cb5]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: ISRCTN44522369.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^5147c512]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

While endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing some new insights, this systematic review has highlighted existing important gaps in the evidence about how best to utilize oral spironolactone in managing acne in women, including clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize the risk of side effects, the lowest effective dose, the possible requirement for concomitant therapies and what these should be, which types of acne are likely to be responsive, and how effective spironolactone is compared with standard therapies. It is interesting to note that several current acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone on the basis of consensus and/or expert opinion. Others either do not mention spironolactone, or specifically say it is regarded as ineffective, not recommended or there is insufficient evidence to support its use. All, including those that purport to be evidence-based, have failed to identify the majority of studies that were included in this systematic review. Although there were five relevant studies that, to date, have proved unobtainable (two of which were almost certainly duplicate publications of included case series), we are confident that all the RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until such time as higher quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will have to continue to rely on recommendations largely based on expert experience or reached via consensus of expert panels. While this review has identified some very-low-quality evidence which showed that the 200 mg daily dose was statistically significantly more effective than placebo versus inflamed lesions, it has also confirmed that this dose is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse side effects than lower doses. Hence, there would appear to be no merit in using these higher doses for managing acne, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. in obese women with PCOS). Data from the multiple case series suggest that any future RCT examining lower doses is likely to generate results that confirm the effectiveness and better safety profile of doses ≤ 100 mg/day.

12. 1 Mechanism of Action Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule. These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and a reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility, and fecundity. Spironolactone tablets, administered i. p.

to female mice during a two-week cohabitation period with untreated males, decreased the number of mated mice that conceived and decreased the number of implanted embryos in those that became pregnant, and at 200 mg/kg, also increased the latency period to mating.

In patients with HFpEF from the Americas, Kaplan–Meier survival curves and cumulative event rates for primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Figures S4 and S5 and Table S3. In patients with resistant hypertension, the primary outcome event rates (number of events per 1000 person‐years) in the spironolactone and placebo groups were 102.4 and 156.0, respectively. The risk of primary outcome events in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension was significantly lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.89; P = 0.006 [Figure S4A]), whereas the risk of primary outcome events in patients with HFpEF without resistant hypertension was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.13; P = 0.50 [Figure S4B]). Kaplan–Meier survival curves for all‐cause death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with HFpEF from the Americas are shown in Figure S5. The risks of all‐cause death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension were significantly lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (HR for all‐cause death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.80; P = 0.002 [Figure S5A]; and HR for heart failure hospitalization, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51–0.98; P = 0.04 [Figure S5B], respectively), whereas the risks in patients with HFpEF without resistant hypertension did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (HR for all‐cause death, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79–1.26; P = 0.96 [Figure S5C]; and HR for heart failure hospitalization, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.68–1.13; P = 0.30 [Figure S5D], respectively). Furthermore, the risks of cardiovascular death and major cardiovascular events in patients from the Americas with resistant hypertension were significantly lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (Table S3). The risk of other outcome events in patients with or without resistant hypertension was not significantly different between the 2 groups.

### Spironolactone [^acbdfa0b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions.

Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

Spironolactone has dose dependent side effects of gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction in men and menstrual irregularities in women, and a meta-analysis estimated higher medication-related adverse events with medical vs surgical therapy (OR: 29.853; 95% CI: 3.726–239.166). Fewer side effects were associated with eplerenone than spironolactone.

### Spironolactone in left-sided heart failure: how does it fit in? [^28a84284]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The familiar diuretic spironolactone has taken on new life as a treatment for left-sided congestive heart failure. Spironolactone has been shown to decrease mortality in such patients who are New York Heart Association class IV. It can be used in addition to agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, which also decrease mortality, and diuretics and digoxin, which are useful in treating symptoms. Spironolactone is safe, easy to use and reasonably priced. More research is necessary to determine the order and combinations of these medications in slowing the progression of this disease.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^058507c5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Spironolactone, a synthetic 17-lactone steroid, acts as a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with moderate affinity for both progesterone and androgen receptors. Spironolactone is predominantly utilized in clinical practice as a potassium-sparing diuretic, however it has been used off-label for acne since the 1980s. A reduction in sebum may be achieved by blocking dihydrotestosterone binding to the androgen receptor within sebocytes and inhibiting androgen-induced sebocyte proliferation. The systemic effects of spironolactone on adrenal synthesis of androgen precursors may also contribute to clinical efficacy, although at therapeutic doses this may be unlikely. The diuretic effect of spironolactone may benefit women who experience a premenstrual acne flare associated with fluid retention.

Successful long-term management of acne in adult women presents a considerable therapeutic challenge. As an anti-androgen and potential inhibitor of sebogenesis, spironolactone represents a possible alternative to oral isotretinoin and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the only licensed anti-acne medications that significantly reduce sebum secretion, but which may be associated with serious adverse effects in some patients. Antibiotics are often over-prescribed in acne, drive antimicrobial resistance in targeted and non-targeted bacteria, and have no effect on sebum synthesis.

A Cochrane review focusing primarily on hirsutism included only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of oral spironolactone for acne in its analyses and concluded there was insufficient evidence for effectiveness in treating acne. In contrast, a narrative review, based largely on clinical experience, highlighted the potential therapeutic usefulness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females, and detailed recommendations about appropriate use and monitoring during therapy.

Take-home messages from these different reviews are contradictory. In view of this clinical uncertainty, we conducted a hybrid systematic review of all studies that had assessed the clinical efficacy of oral spironolactone for acne in women. The primary aim was to determine whether oral spironolactone monotherapy produces a degree of improvement in acne that is clinically important and comparable to conventional drug-based remedies. Secondary aims were to identify evidence that could better inform clinicians on the selection of patients likely to benefit, and/or reveal the most appropriate dosing regimen.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^13b000c2]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

As for the increased awareness of primary aldosteronism as a potentially preventable or curable cause of resistant hypertension, possible investigations and treatments in selected centres and patients will probably vary greatly, as will what can be more widely recommended on the basis of available clinical and health economic evidence. Prospective evaluation of sodium-to-potassium ratios might allow their use as an initial screening filter. Management of primary aldosteronism is rapidly changing as less invasive modalities become available for diagnosis and treatment of functional adenomas.

Our study has some limitations. By design, only some of the patients in PATHWAY-2 participated in the various substudies. However, baseline characteristics were similar between the cohorts. Prospective power was calculated for the primary outcome in PATHWAY-2, but not for the individual substudies, which were intended to allow prespecified, secondary mechanistic analyses that might help to explain the results of the main study. In our favour, the size of the study proved much larger than necessary to detect the primary outcome, having been powered to detect a difference of only 3 mm Hg between spironolactone and other drugs, at an α of 0·003;, indeed, post-hoc analysis of the first cycle of treatment showed the superiority of spironolactone in just 80 patients. Urine aldosterone measurements might have helped to confirm a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism. Finally, the similarity and correlation of the amiloride responses with those previously measured on spironolactone add qualified support for use of open-label treatment to simplify and encourage complex rotation studies, but do not guarantee that the two potassium-sparing diuretics are interchangeable. The finding that only the spironolactone response correlated with SUSPPUP might point to spironolactone as the more effective drug when aldosterone is the cause of sodium retention, and amiloride when the cause is clearly downstream.

We conclude that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone is an effective treatment of resistant hypertension because resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining condition probably due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Amiloride seems to be an effective, well tolerated alternative to spironolactone. Finally, our findings should encourage debate about whether thresholds for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism should be reconsidered in patients presenting with resistant hypertension, and about the possibility of earlier diagnosis of primary aldosteronism to prevent development of resistant hypertension.

Primary outcome

There was no significant difference in the number of participants who experienced the composite primary outcome (defined as the time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death and failed sudden death), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease (PAD), or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline) between groups (Fig. 2) — 113 primary outcome events among the 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) compared to 111 among the 695 participants (16.0%) in the usual care arm (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.81–1.37, P = 0.702). Summary statistics for the primary are shown in Table 2. The incidence rate per 100 years at risk was 6.83 among participants prescribed spironolactone, compared to 6.27 among those in the usual care group and 6.54 among all participants.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^aa3b76b7]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Secondary clinical outcomes

There were no significant differences between groups for any of the individual components of the primary endpoint, including hospitalization (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.64–1.53, P = 0.970), CVD (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.80–1.61, P = 0.478) or death (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.70–1.70, P = 0.699; Table 2). In total, 6.0% of participants died, including 42 (6.2%) deaths among the intervention group and 38 (5.5%) among those randomized to usual care.

Among participants randomized to spironolactone compared to usual care, there was a small reduction in mean eGFR over follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, 95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37, P = 0.004; Table 3). A modest deterioration in mean eGFR was observed in the spironolactone arm at 6 months to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, which then remained stable at 1, 2 and 3 years. The mean eGFR in the control group was stable for up to 2 years and then a small decline to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 at year 3. Although small differences, these slightly lower mean eGFRs in the spironolactone participants were statistically significant at each follow-up time point (Table 3). Among those randomized to spironolactone, the adjusted treatment effects for eGFR at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, were −1.68 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −2.41 to −0.94), −2.33 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −3.08 to −1.58), −0.89 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.69 to −0.09) and −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37; Table 3).

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^0b80121b]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the trial question was: is spironolactone superior to add-on doxazosin in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 282 doxazosin (at a dose of 4 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.7 mmHg; AD 4.03 mmHg, 95% CI 3.02 to 5.04). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 9.1 mmHg; AD 5.3 mmHg, 95% CI 3.83 to 6.77) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 16.3 mmHg; AD 4.42 mmHg, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.75). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to doxazosin with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^c9cd024e]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, among participants with stage 3b CKD, treatment with low-dose spironolactone was not associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular events compared to usual care. Discontinuation from the study due to safety concerns was more common among participants randomized to spironolactone. This suggests that low-dose spironolactone should not generally be used in people with stage 3b CKD unless there is another explicit indication for the treatment.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^71364c5e]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult women.

Design

Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary and secondary healthcare, and advertising in the community and on social media in England and Wales.

Participants

Women (≥ 18 years) with facial acne for at least six months, judged to warrant oral antibiotics.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either 50 mg/day spironolactone or matched placebo until week six, increasing to 100 mg/day spironolactone or placebo until week 24. Participants could continue using topical treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) symptom subscale score at week 12 (range 0–30, where higher scores reflect improved QoL). Secondary outcomes were Acne-QoL at week 24, participant self-assessed improvement; investigator's global assessment (IGA) for treatment success; and adverse reactions.

Results

From 5 June 2019 to 31 August 2021, 1267 women were assessed for eligibility, 410 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 201) or control group (n = 209) and 342 were included in the primary analysis (n = 176 in the intervention group and n = 166 in the control group). Baseline mean age was 29.2 years (standard deviation 7.2), 28 (7%) of 389 were from ethnicities other than white, with 46% mild, 40% moderate, and 13% severe acne. Mean Acne-QoL symptom scores at baseline were 13.2 (standard deviation 4.9) and at week 12 were 19.2 (6.1) for spironolactone and 12.9 (4.5) and 17.8 (5.6) for placebo (difference favouring spironolactone 1.27 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 2.46), adjusted for baseline variables). Scores at week 24 were 21.2 (5.9) for spironolactone and 17.4 (5.8) for placebo (difference 3.45 (95% confidence interval 2.16 to 4.75), adjusted). More participants in the spironolactone group reported acne improvement than in the placebo group: no significant difference was reported at week 12 (72% v 68%, odds ratio 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.91)) but significant difference was noted at week 24 (82% v 63%, 2.72 (1.50 to 4.93)). Treatment success (IGA classified) at week 12 was 31 (19%) of 168 given spironolactone and nine (6%) of 160 given placebo (5.18 (2.18 to 12.28)). Adverse reactions were slightly more common in the spironolactone group with more headaches reported (20% v 12%; p = 0.02). No serious adverse reactions were reported.

Conclusions

Spironolactone improved outcomes compared with placebo, with greater differences at week 24 than week 12. Spironolactone is a useful alternative to oral antibiotics for women with acne.

Trial Registration

### Efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in subjects with resistant hypertension [^259ef3f5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports have demonstrated the antihypertensive efficacy of high doses of spironolactone in subjects with primary aldosteronism and, to a lesser degree, subjects with resistant hypertension.

Methods

In current analysis, we examined the antihypertensive benefit of adding low-dose spironolactone to multidrug regimens that included a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in subjects with resistant hypertension with and without primary aldosteronism. Subjects referred for resistant hypertension were evaluated with an early morning plasma renin activity, 24-h urinary aldosterone and sodium during a high dietary salt ingestion. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed with a renin activity < 1.0 ng/mL/h, urinary aldosterone > 12 mug/24 h and urinary sodium > 200 mEq/24 h. After biochemical evaluation, spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) was added to each subject's antihypertensive regimen. If blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled, the dose of spironolactone was titrated up to 50 mg/d. Follow-up BP was determined at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

Results

A total number of 76 subjects were included in the analysis, 34 of whom had biochemical primary aldosteronism. Low-dose spironolactone was associated with an additional mean decrease in BP of 21 ± 21/10 ± 14 mm Hg at 6 weeks and 25 ± 20/12 ± 12 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. The BP reduction was similar in subjects with and without primary aldosteronism and was additive to the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.

Conclusions

We conclude that low-dose spironolactone provides significant additive BP reduction in African American and white subjects with resistant hypertension with and without primary aldosteronism.

### Spironolactone use and improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with resistant hypertension [^bbd625bc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes in Patients With HFpEF With or Without Resistant Hypertension

In patients with HFpEF with or without resistant hypertension, the mean (SD) follow‐up periods were 3.1 (1.7) and 3.2 (1.7) years, respectively, and 210 and 461 patients had at least 1 confirmed primary outcome event, respectively. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and cumulative event rates for primary outcome events in patients with HFpEF with or without resistant hypertension are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. In patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension, primary outcome event rates (number of events per 1000 person‐years) in the spironolactone and placebo groups were 81.7 and 56.0, respectively. The risk of primary outcome events in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension was significantly lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.91; P = 0.009 [Figure 1A]), whereas the risk of primary outcome events in patients with HFpEF without resistant hypertension was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83–1.20; P = 0.97 [Figure 1B]). There was a significant interaction between spironolactone use and resistant hypertension (P = 0.03). Kaplan–Meier survival curves for all‐cause death and hospitalization for heart failure are shown in Figure 2. The risk of all‐cause death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension were significantly lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (HR for all‐cause death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44–0.91; P = 0.01 [Figure 2A]; and HR for heart failure hospitalization, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51–0.94; P = 0.01 [Figure 2B], respectively), whereas those risks in patients with HFpEF without resistant hypertension did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (HR for all‐cause death, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86–1.27; P = 0.63 [Figure 2C]; and HR for heart failure hospitalization, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72–1.15; P = 0.41 [Figure 2D], respectively). The risk of other outcome events in patients with or without resistant hypertension was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Table 2).

### Innovative use of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in the treatment of female pattern hair loss [^75799988]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Patterned hair loss in men and women, although medically benign, is a common, albeit unwelcome, event that may cause considerable anxiety and concern. Patterned hair loss is progressive and when untreated leads to baldness. The prevalence and severity of this physiologic process both increase with advancing age. Although androgens play a key role in the pathogenesis of male pattern hair loss (MPHL), the role of androgens in female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is less well established. Satisfactory treatment response to antiandrogen therapy supports the involvement of androgens in the pathogenesis of FPHL. Spironolactone has been used for 30 years as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid structurally related to aldosterone. Since the serendipitous discovery 20 years ago that spironolactone given to a woman for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and associated hypertension also improved hirsutism, it has been used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism. Spironolactone both reduces adrenal androgen production and exerts competitive blockade on androgen receptors in target tissues. Spironolactone has been used off-label in FPHL for over 20 years. It has been shown to arrest hair loss progression with a long-term safety profile. A significant percentage of women also achieve partial hair regrowth. Spironolactone is not used in male androgenetic alopecia because of the risk of feminization.

a Inhibition of steroidogenesis in the adrenals, ovaries and/or peripheral tissues, including skin, reduces serum levels of androgens and androgen precursors

Four of the RCTs evaluated spironolactone in combination with a COC. Hirsutism or PCOS was the primary diagnosis and acne was the secondary diagnosis. Since COCs are potent anti-androgens, and are effective as monotherapy for acne, superiority of the combination needs to be demonstrated over the COC alone. Despite this, only one trial included a COC monotherapy arm and found no benefit of adding spironolactone to norgestimate/EE, although, at trend, the combination was more effective. In this three-arm trial, treatment allocation was unbalanced, with three times as many women in the combination arm as those receiving COC monotherapy. Any added benefit of spironolactone might have been revealed had treatment arms been of equal size.

One potentially more useful trial put spironolactone head-to-head against oral tetracycline and found no difference in efficacy over 8 weeks of treatment; however, caution is necessary in interpreting the results as this trial was also unbalanced, with 63 women receiving spironolactone but only 14 receiving tetracycline. Interestingly, the duration of therapy was consistently short (2–3 months) for those RCTs in which acne was the primary diagnosis, and much longer (9–12 months) for the trials in which hirsutism was the primary diagnosis. After only 3 months of treatment, the response of acne to spironolactone may not be optimal. The case series show that clinicians often use longer courses to manage acne in the real world. Using the PP population, improvement rates were significantly higher in the case series compared with those RCTs that had also used an outcome measure that could be dichotomized. This difference in efficacy rates may be an indication that longer treatment is likely to be more successful.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^013850de]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

Results

With a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.04; P = 0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P = 0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7%, vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter) or higher, or dialysis.

### Spironolactone in dermatology: uses in acne and beyond [^f2968bad]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a synthetic aldosterone receptor antagonist, with a role off-label in various dermatological conditions. Its antiandrogenic properties make it suitable for diseases in which excess androgen production results in unwanted and psychologically distressing manifestations in susceptible females. Treatment with spironolactone aims to attenuate androgen-mediated conditions including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, female pattern hair loss and hirsutism. We discuss the emerging utility of spironolactone in dermatology, its potential adverse effects and considerations for monitoring.

### The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure. randomized aldactone evaluation study investigators [^12303b2b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1999). Excellent credibility.

The study RALES was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 1999 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the RALES study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with severe HF and a LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi? In the RALES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RALES study, the population was: 1663 patients (446 female, 1217 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi. The key exclusion criteria were congenital heart disease, unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active cancer, or any life-threatening disease (other than HF), or heart transplantation. In the RALES study, the interventions were: n = 822 spironolactone (25 mg daily) n = 841 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the RALES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 24 months (35% vs. 46%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.82). In the RALES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in frequency of hospitalization for worsening HF (26% vs. 35%; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77) Significant increase in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%; RR 10, 95% CI 4.07 to 15.93). In the RALES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious hyperkalemia. significant differences in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). In the RALES study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to death at 24 months.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

### Spironolactone [^755ae6f9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Effect of spironolactone on blood pressure in subjects with resistant hypertension [^0536c791]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is recommended as fourth-line therapy for essential hypertension despite few supporting data for this indication. We evaluated the effect among 1411 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm who received spironolactone mainly as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent for uncontrolled blood pressure and who had valid BP measurements before and during spironolactone treatment. Among those who received spironolactone, the mean age was 63 years (SD: ± 8 years), 77% were men, and 40% had diabetes. Spironolactone was initiated a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 4.4 years) after randomization and added to a mean of 2.9 (SD: ± 0.9) other antihypertensive drugs. The median duration of spironolactone treatment was 1.3 years (interquartile range: 0.6 to 2.6 years). The median dose of spironolactone was 25 mg (interquartile range: 25 to 50 mg) at both the start and end of the observation period. During spironolactone therapy, mean blood pressure fell from 156.9/85.3 mm Hg (SD: ± 18.0/11.5 mm Hg) by 21.9/9.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.0/9.0 to 10.1 mm Hg; P < 0.001); the BP reduction was largely unaffected by age, sex, smoking, and diabetic status. Spironolactone was generally well tolerated; 6% of participants discontinued the drug because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse events were gynecomastia or breast discomfort and biochemical abnormalities (principally hyperkaliemia), which were recorded as adverse events in 6% and 2% of participants, respectively. In conclusion, spironolactone effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension uncontrolled by a mean of approximately 3 other drugs. Although nonrandomized and not placebo controlled, these data support the use of spironolactone in uncontrolled hypertension.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperaldosteronism in patients with hypertension: a practical approach endorsed by the British and Irish hypertension society [^cd12ee18]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

If adrenalectomy is not clinically indicated or individuals are not willing to consider a surgical intervention, medical management should be initiated. MRAs, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, are recommended in order to control blood pressure and achieve normokalaemia.

Spironolactone and eplerenone are MRAs available in the UK, although only spironolactone is licensed for primary hyperaldosteronism. Spironolactone, developed in the 1950s, has structural elements of the progesterone molecule; thus, it is associated with progestogenic and antiandrogenic adverse effects. Eplerenone is a spironolactone derivative designed to enhance selective binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor, whilst minimizing binding to progesterone and androgen receptors. MRAs-induced side effects are common, dose-dependent, and can be troublesome particularly in men. Although eplerenone is more selective (thus potentially causing fewer side effects), it is also a less potent antagonist of the MR, and shorter acting, compared with spironolactone. In general, eplerenone must be dosed twice as high as spironolactone for therapeutic equivalence. Clinical evidence suggest that when used at an appropriate dose, both drugs are safe and effective treatment in patients with PA.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^33a1a088]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Mortality hazard ratios for some subgroups are shown in Figure 2. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Spironolactone in dermatology [^1f06fbfb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a drug, similar in structure to aldosterone and acts as an aldosterone receptor antagonist with an anti-androgenic effect. This drug has proven to be useful in several dermatological entities, however its use has not been well explored. Its use in diseases such as acne has opened the door to the possibility of new therapies depending on the clinical manifestations of the patients, as well as its possible to use it as a first line treatment. Other diseases associated with the use of spironolactone where its effects have been shown to be useful are hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and female pattern androgenetic alopecia. In this review, we discuss the use of spironolactone in different skin diseases that are common in our environment, dosage according to different studies, treatment recommendations and adverse effects; all of the above mentioned in order to use this drug in a daily clinical practice.

Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy. Spironolactone is effective in lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. It is also effective in most cases of essential hypertension, despite the fact that aldosterone secretion may be within normal limits in benign essential hypertension.

Through its action in antagonizing the effect of aldosterone, spironolactone inhibits the exchange of sodium for potassium in the distal renal tubule and helps to prevent potassium loss. Spironolactone is indicated in the management of: Establishing the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism by therapeutic trial. Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are judged to be poor operative risks or who decline surgery. Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro- or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. Congestive heart failure: For the management of edema and sodium retention when the patient is only partially responsive to, or is intolerant of, other therapeutic measures.

Spironolactone is also indicated for patients with congestive heart failure taking digitalis when other therapies are considered inappropriate. Spironolactone is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. For the treatment of patients with hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate or inadequate. Spironolactone is also indicated for the prophylaxis of hypokalemia in patients taking digitalis when other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate. To increase survival, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure when used in addition to standard therapy.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^93754f15]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Post hoc analyses

The slow rate of recruitment meant the follow-up of earlier recruits was longer than planned, which would have increased the chance of competing risks influencing the primary outcomes of interest. We, therefore, performed a post hoc per-protocol sensitivity analysis restricted to events observed in 3 years of follow-up of participants, as originally planned (Extended Data Fig. 4). This analysis showed no difference in rates of death, new-onset CVD or hospitalization in these participants with CKD stage 3b receiving spironolactone compared to usual care (Extended Data Fig. 4). Because of the late correction of PAD in the composite primary outcome (Methods), we also performed a post hoc sensitivity of the primary analysis with and without PAD, which showed no difference (Extended Data Fig. 5).

In the post hoc conditional power calculations, the average conditional probability power was 30.4% when event rates were simulated based on the previous data used to inform our sample size calculation, but only 11.8% when simulated based on the observed event rate within our study.

Finally, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of the primary outcome and safety analysis by participants' gender. The HR for the primary outcome among women was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.77–1.71) and among men was 0.97 (0.68–1.38; Extended Data Table 3). Safety events were similar between men and women (Extended Data Tables 4 and 5), although the trial was not powered to detect differences between genders.

### Rationale and design of the treatment of preserved cardiac function heart failure with an aldosterone antagonist trial: a randomized, controlled study of spironolactone in patients with symptomatic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^b6fac0cd]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite increasing prevalence of heart failure (HF) in patients with preserved ejection fraction (PEF), there are no available therapies proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. Aldosterone, a potent stimulator of myocardial and vascular fibrosis, may be a key mediator of HF progression in this population and is therefore an important therapeutic target.

Objective

The TOPCAT trial is designed to evaluate the effect of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life in patients with HF-PEF.

Methods

Up to 3,515 patients with HF-PEF will be randomized in double-blind fashion to treatment with spironolactone (target dose 30 mg daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients include those with age ≥ 50 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%, symptomatic HF, and either a hospitalization for HF within the prior year or an elevated natriuretic peptide level (B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 100 pg/mL or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 360 pg/mL) within the 60 days before randomization. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension and those with known infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are excluded. The primary end point is the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for HF, or aborted cardiac arrest. Key secondary end points include quality of life, nonfatal cardiovascular events, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Ancillary studies of echocardiography, tonometry, and cardiac biomarkers will provide more insight regarding this understudied population and the effects of spironolactone therapy.

Conclusion

TOPCAT is designed to assess definitively the role of spironolactone in the management of HF-PEF.

### Carospir [^27e39f16]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, Spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^5da29fc9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether lower than target doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) were started at 15mg/day, and increased up to a maximum of 45mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 75years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2, and with potassium levels > 4.5mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median≈20mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death without significant heterogeneity between the study subgroups (P interaction > 0.1). Spironolactone discontinuation was associated with a two to fourfold higher risk of subsequent events.

Conclusion

Spironolactone (but not placebo) was used at lower doses among the elderly, those with renal dysfunction and with higher potassium levels. The effect of spironolactone was homogeneous across these subgroups. In patients unable to tolerate target doses, a low-dose strategy should be preferred to stopping treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperaldosteronism in patients with hypertension: a practical approach endorsed by the British and Irish hypertension society [^ffa3a962]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone has a slow onset of action relative to vasodilators and is usually started at a relatively low dose (12.5–25 mg once daily). Electrolytes, creatinine, and blood pressure should be reassessed within 4 weeks (before titrating the dose upward), but these tests could be assessed sooner in patients with renal insufficiency who are prone to develop electrolytes abnormalities since the risk of severe hyperkalaemia is mitigated by appropriate monitoring. Because PA induces a hyperfiltration state, a small rise in serum creatinine is expected in PA patients on treatment with MRA, reflecting the effects of the drug on glomerular hemodynamic. Spironolactone can be increased to the maximum tolerated dose until the patient maintains normokalaemia without potassium supplementation (usually achieved with doses of spironolactone < 100 mg od). Non-adherence and incomplete adherence are common in resistant hypertension and should be evaluated particularly in subjects with refractory hypokalaemia despite MRA treatment. Doses of spironolactone > 100 mg daily for PA have reportedly been used with anecdotal reports of 200–400 mg daily doses used chronically for PA. Plasma renin might be used as an additional marker to evaluate successful aldosterone blockade. In cases of persistent renin suppression, increasing the MRA dose should be considered, provided that there are no contraindications (e.g. antiandrogen side effects, hyperkalaemia, reduced kidney function). Common side effects of spironolactone in women include spotting and breast tenderness; contraception for those of reproductive potential should always be advised. Men can develop gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction due to spironolactone's antagonism of testosterone. The incidence of gynaecomastia may be as high as 30% at 100 mg daily and 62% at 200 mg daily. If adverse effects to spironolactone develop, eplerenone can be considered an off-label substitute, usually given twice daily at a dose twice that of spironolactone.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^98bd403a]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

There was no significant difference in total healthcare resource use costs comparing between treatment groups at any follow-up time point nor a significant difference in the subcategories of primary care, secondary care or medication costs. Total mean healthcare resource use costs at 3-year follow-up for people randomized to spironolactone were £1,080 compared to £1,136 with usual care, a mean difference of −£56 (bootstrapped 95% CI: −£463 to £378, P = 0.796). There was no difference in mean EuroQol five-dimensions five-levels (EQ-5D-5L) scores between the two treatment arms at baseline, 6-month, 1-year or 2-year follow-up. However, by 3-year follow-up, spironolactone was associated with an increased mean score (0.751) compared to usual care (0.719) that was statistically significant (mean difference 0.032, 95% CI: 0.001–0.060, P = 0.037). There was no significant difference in Kidney Disease Quality of Life scores between groups across follow-up, although there was a statistically significant difference in favor of usual care for the burden of kidney disease component of the score at 1-year (spironolactone 91.0, usual care 93.2; P = 0.017) and a statistically significant difference in favor of spironolactone in the physical composite scale at 3-years in the complete case analysis (spironolactone 42.9, usual care 39.6; P = 0.008).

### Influence of ejection fraction on outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^39c46f69]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

While mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to benefit patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), spironolactone did not reduce the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT trial, which enrolled patients with LVEF of 45% or greater. We utilized data from TOPCAT to assess the relationship between LVEF as well as outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone.

Methods and Results

We assessed differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes across LVEF categories in 3444 patients with HFpEF, and determined whether LVEF modified the treatment effect of spironolactone. Ejection fraction ranged from 44 to 85%. Patients with higher ejection fraction were older, more likely to be female, less likely to have a history of myocardial infarction, and more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes. The incidence of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular death was highest in patients at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum. Ejection fraction modified the spironolactone treatment effect, particularly in the patients enrolled in the Americas, for the primary outcome (P = 0.046) and for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.039), with stronger estimated benefits of spironolactone at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum with respect to the primary endpoint (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.50, 1.05; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76, 1.23) and heart failure hospitalization (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46, 1.27; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74, 1.30).

Conclusion

In patients with HFpEF enrolled in TOPCAT, patient characteristics and outcomes varied substantially by LVEF. The potential efficacy of spironolactone was greatest at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^5b042868]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a potassium‐sparing diuretic and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which has been used to treat a wide range of conditions including cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertension. As demonstrated by the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, spironolactone is an effective treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction. Given the success in HF with reduced ejection fraction and that spironolactone decreases the interstitial fibrotic process that is common in HFpEF, multiple clinical trials have investigated whether spironolactone also effectively treats HFpEF, with only a few that evaluated death and all‐cause hospitalization outcomes. Though findings varied across studies, and many lacked significant results, meta‐analysis pooling data suggest that spironolactone improves diastolic function and reduces blood pressure in HFpEF but had minimal effect on death and hospitalization outcomes. The largest trial thus far, the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial), also did not show a benefit on the primary composite outcome, although spironolactone did significantly reduce HF hospitalizations. Furthermore, wide regional variations may have contributed to the lack of a significant effect on the primary composite outcome in TOPCAT, because stratification by region demonstrated significant outcome improvements in the Americas but not in Russia and Georgiaand potential issues with adherence in Russia and Georgia. Additional trials, SPIRRIT‐HFPEF (Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) and SPIRIT‐HF (Spironolactone in the Treatment of Heart Failure), are currently underway to further assess the efficacy of spironolactone in HFpEF.

Based on the results of the TOPCAT trial, current guidelines include a IIb level of evidence recommendation for spironolactone in HFpEF. We conducted the current study to further investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone on death and hospitalization outcomes in a real‐world setting using national electronic health record data, to generate real‐world evidence for the effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism in HFpEF.

### Spironolactone for hirsutism in polycystic ovary syndrome [^7cd52ba3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the level of evidence for treatment of hirsutism associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with spironolactone.

Data Sources

Studies and reports were located in MEDLINE (1966-January 2005), EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts through the second week of January 2005.

Data Synthesis

Hirsutism is a common clinical problem and is often associated with PCOS. Research has been performed to assess the efficacy of spironolactone therapy in patients with hirsute characteristics. Five studies that evaluated the effectiveness of spironolactone for hirsutism in PCOS were identified and reviewed.

Conclusions

The effects of multiple treatment options on the subjective and objective measures of hirsutism have displayed varying results. The outcomes reported to date have shown a positive trend toward using spironolactone in women with PCOS and hirsutism.

### Spironolactone tablets, USP… [^6c4b56b9]. FDA (DailyMed) (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of action: Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions.

Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy. Spironolactone is effective in lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. It is also effective in most cases of essential hypertension, despite the fact that aldosterone secretion may be within normal limits in benign essential hypertension. Through its action in antagonizing the effect of aldosterone, spironolactone inhibits the exchange of sodium for potassium in the distal renal tubule and helps to prevent potassium loss. Spironolactone tablets are indicated in the management of: Primary hyperaldosteronism for: Establishing the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism by therapeutic trial. Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism.

Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are judged to be poor operative risks or who decline surgery. Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. Edematous conditions for patients with: Congestive heart failure: For the management of edema and sodium retention when the patient is only partially responsive to, or is intolerant of, other therapeutic measures. Spironolactone tablets are also indicated for patients with congestive heart failure taking digitalis when other therapies are considered inappropriate.

### Spironolactone management of resistant hypertension [^c06e48a9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone in the treatment of resistant hypertension.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-July 2010), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2010), and Cochrane database (2009) for the key words spironolactone or resistant hypertension. References cited in the articles were reviewed for additional information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature reporting pharmacology data from animal studies and clinical trials evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone were included.

Data Synthesis

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic with anti-aldosterone effects that are beneficial in the management of hypertension. Spironolactone has shown improvement in 5 prospective studies and 1 retrospective study evaluating its blood pressuring-lowering abilities in patients with resistant hypertension. Specifically, the average blood pressure lowering noted in these trials with the addition of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension was 22/10 mm Hg. Trials evaluating spironolactone's role in resistant hypertension treatment have identified hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and renal insufficiency as the major adverse effects that warrant monitoring.

Conclusions

Spironolactone is an appropriate antihypertensive medication to add to treatment of patients with resistant hypertension (≥ 3 antihypertensive medications at optimal doses) not at their blood pressure goal. In patients considered to have resistant hypertension, secondary causes should be ruled out.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^72f7c03f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — underdiagnosis, screening, and treatment implications — remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, and screening is critically low and often delayed until years after hypertension has been diagnosed. The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated BP and hypertension suggest screening for PA in all adults with diagnosed hypertension. For treatment, individuals with lateralizing PA can often be cured through unilateral adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral PA typically benefit from mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone or eplerenone, which effectively control BP, alleviate hypokalemia, and mitigate excess cardiovascular risk; however, MRAs are not routinely used as first-line treatments for hypertension, resulting in missed diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for those with undiagnosed PA.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^c45fe831]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening test interpretation and patient preparation — relies on combined interpretation of plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and the aldosterone to renin activity ratio as the most accurate and reliable screening approach. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive, and the most commonly used aldosterone to renin activity ratio cutoff is 30 (with plasma aldosterone in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h), although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally, MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone) withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing, and additional evaluation may be indicated if the renin activity is suppressed; low screening rates may be due to barriers such as older medication-withdrawal guidance, which has since been disputed by growing evidence supporting screening despite treatment with most medications.

The dose response of spironolactone for hypertension has not been well characterized. In patients with hypertension, decreases in systolic blood pressure have been observed at doses ranging from 25 to 100 mg/day. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^7e56c17b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The present data, stemming from a trial aimed at demonstrating the MRA‐enabling effect of the potassium binder patiromer in high cardiovascular risk patients, corroborate and extend the results obtained in another HFrEF population. 19 In that trial (PEARL‐HF), patiromer enabled spironolactone use and prevented hyperkalaemia in patients with predominantly HFrEF with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a history of hyperkalaemia that provoked discontinuation of drugs blocking the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. 19 Whether this enabling effect may ultimately lead to improved cardiovascular outcomes is currently being tested in the ongoing DIAMOND trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03888066).

Several clinical outcome trials have been performed in patients with HFpEF, yet none have met their primary endpoint. 9 The TOPCAT trial comparing spironolactone with placebo did not meet its primary endpoint, with an 11% non‐significant reduction in cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. The 18% nominally significant risk reduction of the primary outcome in the Americas has encouraged societies in the US to believe that, if properly implemented, spironolactone may improve outcomes in patients with HFpEF. 9 In HFpEF patients with resistant hypertension from the Americas enrolled in TOPCAT, a post hoc analysis showed that spironolactone enabled better blood pressure control. 20 The magnitude of the blood pressure‐lowering effect [−5.53 (1.95) mmHg vs. placebo] after 4 months in TOPCAT 20 was actually close to that observed after 3 months (−8 to −9 mmHg) in both treatment groups of HF patients receiving open‐label spironolactone in AMBER, despite the fact that the two study populations were notably different (i.e. kidney function being more impaired in AMBER: mean of 36 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in AMBER vs. 61–64 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in TOPCAT). Moreover, the blood pressure reductions in the HF subgroup in AMBER were generally consistent with those observed in the overall study population (−11 to −12 mmHg). If the guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF include spironolactone, the results of the AMBER subgroup analysis presented here would become even more broadly applicable.

### Adoption of spironolactone therapy for older patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the United States, 1998–2001 [^7516cce1]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of spironolactone use in some patients with heart failure. We studied the adoption of spironolactone therapy after publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in national cohorts of older patients hospitalized for heart failure.

Methods and Results

This is a study of serial cross-sectional samples of Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years old discharged after hospitalization for the primary diagnosis of heart failure and with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The first sample was discharged before (April 1998 to March 1999, n = 9758) and the second sample after (July 2000 to June 2001, n = 9468) publication of RALES in September 1999. We assessed spironolactone prescriptions at hospital discharge in patient groups defined by enrollment criteria for the trial. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified factors independently associated with prescriptions not meeting these criteria. Spironolactone use increased > 7-fold (3.0% to 21.3% P < 0.0001) after RALES. Of patients meeting enrollment criteria, 24.1% received spironolactone, as compared with 17.4% of those not meeting the criteria. Of all prescriptions after RALES, 30.9% were provided to patients not meeting enrollment criteria. Spironolactone was prescribed to 22.8% of patients with a serum potassium value ≥ 5.0 mmol/L, to 14.1% with a serum creatinine value ≥ 2.5 mg/dL, and to 17.3% with severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)). In multivariable analyses, factors associated with prescriptions not meeting enrollment criteria included advanced age, noncardiovascular comorbidities, discharge to skilled nursing facilities, and care provided by physicians without board certification.

Conclusions

Spironolactone prescriptions increased markedly after the publication of RALES, and many treated patients were at risk for hyperkalemia. Simultaneously, many patients who might have benefited were not treated. These findings demonstrate the importance of balancing efforts to enhance use among appropriate patients and minimizing use in patients at risk for adverse events.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^68c7fb3b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — benefits, harms, and justification for PA-specific treatment are summarized as follows: Aldosterone excess has adverse cardiovascular and renal effects beyond hypertension, with a higher rate of cardiovascular and renal complications in individuals with primary aldosteronism (PA) compared with primary hypertension matched for blood pressure (BP) levels. Unilateral adrenalectomy in lateralizing PA often leads to cure of hypertension and is associated with a lower rate of cardio- and cerebrovascular complications than in matched primary hypertension. Observational data report complete biochemical resolution of PA at 6-month follow-up after unilateral adrenalectomy, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy reduced systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) without a significant increase in antihypertensive treatment, whereas nonspecific antihypertensive therapy reduced SBP and DBP at 6 months but with increased treatment. PA-specific treatment is associated with significant BP reduction, and with MRAs in sufficient doses to unsuppress renin the risk is similar (rather than higher) to matched primary hypertension, while insufficient doses still display higher risk. Spironolactone's dose-dependent adverse effects, including gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities, limit tolerability, whereas newer MRAs such as eplerenone have a much lower side effect profile; surgical therapy requires skilled surgeons and adequate postsurgical care to minimize surgical complications. While the certainty of evidence is low, indirect data from noncomparative cohorts support the intervention.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^ed646006]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

Absorption

The mean time to reach peak plasma concentration of spironolactone and the active metabolite, canrenone, in healthy volunteers is 2.6 and 4.3 hours, respectively.

Effect of food: Food increased the bioavailability of spironolactone (as measured by AUC) by approximately 95.4%. Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking ALDACTONE with regard to meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Distribution

Spironolactone and its metabolites are more than 90% bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

The mean half-life of spironolactone is 1.4 hour. The mean half-life values of its metabolites including canrenone, 7-α-(thiomethyl) spirolactone (TMS), and 6-β-hydroxy-7-α-(thiomethyl) spirolactone (HTMS) are 16.5, 13.8, and 15 hours, respectively.

### Sex differences in outcomes and responses to spironolactone in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of TOPCAT trial [^0f736d3b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate sex differences in outcomes and responses to spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Background

HFpEF affects women more frequently than men. Sex differences in responses to effects of mineralocorticoid antagonists have not been reported.

Methods

This was an exploratory, post hoc, non-pre-specified analysis of the TOPCAT (Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function) trial. Subjects with symptomatic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone or placebo therapy. Subjects enrolled from the Americas were analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, cardiac arrest, or HF hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, CV, and non-CV mortality and CV, HF, and non-CV hospitalization. Sex differences in outcomes and treatment effects were determined using time-to-event analysis.

Results

In total, 882 of 1,767 subjects (49.9%) were women. Women were older with fewer comorbidities but worse patient-reported outcomes. There were no sex differences in outcomes in the placebo arm or in response to spironolactone for the primary outcome or its components. Spironolactone therapy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in women (hazard ratio: 0.66; p = 0.01) but not in men (p interaction = 0.02).

Conclusions

In TOPCAT, women and men presented with different clinical profiles and similar clinical outcomes. The interaction between spironolactone and sex in TOPCAT overall and in the present analysis was nonsignificant for the primary outcome, but there was a reduction in all-cause mortality associated with spironolactone therapy in women, with a significant interaction between sex and treatment arm. Prospective evaluation is needed to determine whether spironolactone therapy may be effective for treatment of HFpEF in women.
