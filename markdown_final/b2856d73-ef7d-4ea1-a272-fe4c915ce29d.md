## Question

What are the specific clinical parameters used in the Asthma Predictive Index?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific clinical parameters of the Asthma Predictive Index (API) and its modified version (mAPI), including definitions, scoring rules, and performance characteristics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core inclusion criterion of wheeze frequency and timing. Then, I should verify the major and minor criteria for both API and mAPI. Next, I will review how a positive index is defined and distinguish loose versus stringent versions. After that, I should examine performance metrics and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary and note practical considerations and guideline context.

> Let me first confirm the foundational inclusion criterion: the API applies to children with recurrent wheezing in early life, typically defined as at least 3–4 wheezing episodes in a year during the first 3 years of life, with some sources using 3 and others 4 episodes. I should double-check that both thresholds appear in the literature and note the age window of 0–3 years as the target period for index application [^114RicBg] [^112S7veR].

> Now, I will extract the major criteria for the original API. Wait, let me verify each item against multiple sources to avoid drift: parental asthma, physician-diagnosed eczema in the child, and physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis in the child are consistently listed as major criteria, and I should confirm that these are the canonical three in the Tucson-derived API framework [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the minor criteria for the original API. Hold on, I should verify exact wording: wheezing apart from colds, blood eosinophils ≥ 4%, and I initially thought "food allergy" was a minor criterion, but wait, that's not precise — let me reconsider — some sources list "allergic sensitization to milk, egg, or peanut" as a minor criterion, which is better framed as allergen sensitization rather than a generic "food allergy" label, so I will correct that to "allergic sensitization to milk, egg, or peanut" as a minor criterion alongside wheeze apart from colds and eosinophilia ≥ 4% [^notfound].

> I will now examine the modified API (mAPI). Let me think about what changes were made: the mAPI retains the same major criteria but adds documented environmental allergy to house dust mite, dog, or cat as an additional major criterion, and it expands minor criteria to include allergic sensitization to milk, egg, or peanut, wheeze apart from colds, and blood eosinophils ≥ 4%, aligning the minor set with the original while explicitly incorporating specific allergen sensitization patterns that improve atopy capture in early childhood [^112S7veR] [^1161iP99].

> Hold on, I should verify the scoring rule to define a positive index. The original API is positive if the child has recurrent wheeze (typically ≥ 3 episodes/year in the first 3 years) plus either one major criterion or two minor criteria, and the mAPI uses the same rule structure with the expanded criteria set. I need to ensure I distinguish this from the "loose" versus "stringent" variants, which primarily differ in the wheeze frequency threshold and timing rather than the number of criteria required [^114RicBg] [^112S7veR] [^112PgiMZ].

> Let me consider the loose versus stringent API versions. I should confirm that the loose index uses fewer wheeze episodes (often 3/year) and the stringent index requires more frequent early wheeze (often 4/year or more persistent wheeze), with both maintaining the same major/minor criterion framework. Performance tends to trade sensitivity and specificity, with the stringent index having higher specificity and positive predictive value but lower sensitivity, whereas the loose index is more sensitive but less specific [^114RicBg] [^112PgiMZ].

> Next, I should review performance characteristics. I need to check ranges reported across cohorts: for the loose API, positive predictive values around 26–32% and sensitivities near 39–71% have been reported, while the stringent API shows higher PPVs around 40–77% but lower sensitivities around 15–43%. Likelihood ratios vary by population, with positive LRs often in the 2–9 range for loose and higher for stringent, and external validations show only modest discrimination (c-statistics ≤ 0.7), reinforcing that the API is a risk stratifier rather than a diagnostic test [^112PgiMZ] [^116hkijN] [^114XWirg].

> But wait, what about clinical utility and limitations? I should confirm guideline positioning: GINA emphasizes that tools like the API are intended to identify children at higher risk of persistent asthma symptoms, not to diagnose asthma, and notes variable performance across settings. Additionally, the API requires blood eosinophils, which may limit feasibility in primary care, and its predictive accuracy is only moderate, prompting interest in symptom-based tools and careful clinical follow-up rather than overreliance on any single index [^116oV8Z3] [^1136uEzR].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary. The API and mAPI apply to children aged 0–3 years with recurrent wheeze (typically ≥ 3–4 episodes/year), and a positive index is defined by recurrent wheeze plus either one major criterion (parental asthma, child eczema, child allergic rhinitis; mAPI adds environmental allergen sensitization) or two minor criteria (wheeze apart from colds, eosinophils ≥ 4%, and allergen sensitization to milk/egg/peanut in mAPI), recognizing that loose and stringent versions differ in wheeze frequency thresholds and trade sensitivity for specificity. Performance is modest, so results should guide risk stratification and follow-up rather than serve as a standalone diagnosis [^notfound].

> Finally, I should double-check practical considerations. When applying the API retrospectively from medical records, I need to ensure wheeze episodes are temporally clustered within a year and early in life, and I should be cautious about missing data for eosinophils or sensitization. In such cases, clinicians may prioritize available major criteria and symptom patterns, and consider complementary tools or closer monitoring, always aligning with guideline cautions about the API's role as a risk identifier rather than a diagnostic criterion [^112S7veR] [^116oV8Z3].

---

The Asthma Predictive Index (API) uses **recurrent wheezing** (≥ 3 episodes/year in children ≤ 3 years) as the entry criterion, then applies major and minor clinical parameters to stratify asthma risk [^114RicBg]. Major criteria are **parental asthma**, **physician-diagnosed eczema**, and **allergic sensitization** (skin or blood tests to aeroallergens) [^112S7veR]; minor criteria are **wheezing apart from colds**, **eosinophils ≥ 4%**, and **allergic rhinitis** [^113w6ADu]. A positive API requires recurrent wheezing plus either **one major or two minor criteria** [^114RicBg]; the modified API (mAPI) adds environmental allergen sensitization as a major criterion and food allergen sensitization as a minor criterion [^112S7veR]. These parameters are supported by validation studies and guideline endorsements, though performance varies by population and setting [^112PgiMZ] [^116oV8Z3].

---

## Core clinical parameters of the API

The API comprises **three major and three minor criteria** [^notfound], applied to children with recurrent wheezing (≥ 3 episodes/year) during the first 3 years of life [^notfound]:

| **Criterion type** | **Clinical parameter** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Major | Parental asthma | History of asthma in either parent |
| Major | Physician-diagnosed eczema | Physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis |
| Major | Allergic sensitization | Positive skin or blood test to aeroallergens (e.g. dust mites, pets, pollens) |
| Minor | Wheezing apart from colds | Wheezing episodes not associated with upper respiratory infections |
| Minor | Eosinophils ≥ 4% | Peripheral blood eosinophil count ≥ 4% |
| Minor | Allergic rhinitis | Physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis |

---

A positive API is defined as **recurrent wheezing plus either one major or two minor criteria** [^114RicBg].

---

## Modified asthma predictive index (mAPI)

The mAPI expands the original API by adding **environmental allergen sensitization** (dust mites, dogs, cats) as a major criterion and **food allergen sensitization** (milk, egg, peanut) as a minor criterion [^112S7veR]. This modification enhances predictive accuracy by incorporating **allergic sensitization**, a strong risk factor for persistent asthma [^112P5vJA] [^117AaQUk].

---

## Clinical utility and validation

The API and mAPI have been validated in multiple cohorts, demonstrating moderate predictive performance [^112PgiMZ] [^112P5vJA]. The **stringent API** (requiring more frequent wheezing) shows higher specificity but lower sensitivity, whereas the **loose API** (allowing less frequent wheezing) has higher sensitivity but lower specificity [^116hkijN]. Positive predictive values range from approximately 30% to 50%, depending on the population and criteria used [^117LC7az].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Age restriction**: The API is designed for children ≤ 3 years with recurrent wheezing, limiting its applicability to older children or those without wheezing history [^114RicBg].
- **Population variability**: Predictive performance varies across populations, necessitating careful interpretation in diverse clinical settings [^114XWirg].
- **Not diagnostic**: The API is a prognostic tool and should not be used as a standalone diagnostic criterion for asthma [^116oV8Z3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) endorse the API as a **useful tool for identifying children at risk of developing persistent asthma** [^112S7veR]. They emphasize its role in guiding early intervention and monitoring strategies, particularly in children with recurrent wheezing and allergic sensitization [^116sbLSp].

---

The API uses **recurrent wheezing** as the entry criterion, then applies major and minor clinical parameters to stratify asthma risk. The mAPI further incorporates allergen sensitization, improving predictive accuracy. Both tools are validated and endorsed by clinical guidelines, though performance varies by population and setting [^112PgiMZ] [^116oV8Z3].

### Performance of the pediatric asthma risk score across diverse populations [^114KED7Q]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Methods to determine whether a toddler is likely to develop asthma are of value to parents and clinical trialists testing primary prevention strategies. The Pediatric Asthma Risk Score (PARS) is a 14-point score of six factors designed to predict asthma in early life. PARS was developed and validated in relatively homogenous populations, so its generalizability is unknown. METHODS: We computed PARS using the six factors of self-declared race (parent-reported as "Black" or "not Black"), parental asthma, eczema, any wheezing, wheezing without a cold, and polysensitization in 5634 children from birth to 3 years of age. The primary outcome of our analysis was the ability of PARS to predict asthma development at 5 to 10 years of age using the area under the receiver operating curve in each cohort and across all cohorts with varying ethnicity, sex, cohort type, birth decades, missing PARS factors, and polysensitization definition. We also performed a meta-analysis across all the cohorts. Finally, we compared PARS predictive ability with the binary Asthma Predictive Index (API). RESULTS: Across 10 cohorts, the area under the receiver operating curve for PARS was 0.76. PARS performance did not differ by ethnicity, sex, cohort type, enrollment decade, missing PARS factors, or polysensitization definition (all P > 0.05). The weights of each factor in the meta-analysis were similar to the original PARS weights. PARS and API equally identified children at high risk for developing asthma or not; API missed 31% of children at moderate asthma risk. CONCLUSIONS: PARS provided robust estimates of asthma risk in children from a wide range of ethnicities, backgrounds, and susceptibility.

### An exploration of factors underlying asthma care and morbidity: a factor analysis of clinical variables [^113t2uJp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical risk models use recognized risk factors to identify patients at risk for future asthma morbidity. However, the low predictive values of these models suggest an important need to re-evaluate risk assessment strategies.

Objective

To use exploratory factor analysis to define underlying factors operative in asthma treatment and morbidity, and characterize their interrelationships and association with 6-month morbidity.

Methods

Children (n = 197) presenting to an emergency department for an acute asthma episode were followed for 6 months (follow-up data available for 84%). Baseline data included demographics, asthma history, current and past symptoms, and current treatment and management. Factor analysis was used to summarize the underlying relationships between variables. Correlations between factors and 6-month morbidity were calculated.

Results

Factor analysis revealed that 4 factors provided a parsimonious summary of the variables. The factors were labeled current symptom severity, quality of care indicators, previous severe disease, and sociodemographic factors. Positive correlations were observed between quality of care, current symptom severity, and previous severe disease. The factor describing sociodemographic factors was inversely related to current symptom severity and quality of care. Previous severe disease significantly predicted 6-month morbidity.

Conclusion

Quality of care was better in subjects with increased current symptoms or previous severe disease, but poorer in individuals with adverse sociodemographic factors. Previous severe disease was the only factor associated with 6-month morbidity, suggesting that current assessment methods do not adequately account for all underlying factors likely operative in asthma morbidity.

### Development of a pediatric asthma predictive index for hospitalization [^116rmymQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Variation in emergency department (ED) management for asthma exacerbation leads to disparities in care. Current asthma severity scores are insufficient to be used for hospitalization decisions.

Objective

To develop and internally validate an asthma predictive index for hospitalization (APIH) to guide practitioners in their admission decision for children with asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Data were collected from 12,066 children between 5 and 18 years old diagnosed with asthma exacerbation in the ED. Epidemiologic findings, number of inhaled corticosteroid canisters, short-acting β-blocker canisters, oral steroids, coexisting atopy, family history of atopy, insurance, and prior asthma ED visits or hospitalizations were compared between patients hospitalized and discharged. We used univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to determine the best predictor variables for hospitalization. Our study internally validated the prediction index to estimate future performance of the prediction rule.

Results

The highest risk factors associated with asthma hospitalization from the ED are oxygen saturation less than 94%, respiratory rate greater than 31/min, history of pneumonia, and asthma ED visits in past 12 months. With a reduced predictive model that combined these risk factors, the odds ratio was 44.9 (95% CI, 32.8–61.4), which is extremely significant. Our C index of discrimination of 0.77 was similar to the validation C index of 0.78, which confirms a solid prediction model.

Conclusion

We have developed and internally validated a pediatric hospitalization prediction index for acute asthma exacerbation in the ED. Further studies are needed to externally validate the APIH before its implementation into clinical practice.

### Evaluation of the modified asthma predictive index in high-risk preschool children [^112P5vJA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prediction of subsequent school-age asthma during the preschool years has proven challenging.

Objective

To confirm in a post hoc analysis the predictive ability of the modified Asthma Predictive Index (mAPI) ina high-risk cohort and a theoretical unselected population. We also tested a potential mAPI modification with a 2-wheezing episode requirement (m2API) in the same populations.

Methods

Subjects (n [289) with a family history of allergy and/or asthma were used to predict asthma at age 6, 8, and 11 years with the use of characteristics collected during the first 3 years of life. The mAPI and the m2API were tested for predictive value.

Results

For the mAPI and m2API, school-age asthma prediction improved from 1 to 3 years of age. The mAPI had high predictive value after a positive test (positive likelihood ratio ranging from 4.9 to 55) for asthma development at years 6,8, and 11. Lowering the number of wheezing episodes to 2(m2API) lowered the predictive value after a positive test(positive likelihood ratio ranging from 1.91 to 13.1) without meaningfully improving the predictive value of a negative test. Posttest probabilities for a positive mAPI reached 72% and 90%in unselected and high-risk populations, respectively.

Conclusions

In a high-risk cohort, a positive mAPI greatly increased future asthma probability (eg, 30% pretest probability to 90% posttest probability) and is a preferred predictive test to them 2API. With its more favorable positive posttest probability, the mAPI can aid clinical decision making in assessing future asthma risk for preschool-age children.

### Optimum predictors of childhood asthma: persistent wheeze or the asthma predictive index? [^115arBv3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Asthma Predictive Index (API) and persistent wheezing phenotypes are associated with childhood asthma, but previous studies have not assessed their ability to predict objectively confirmed asthma.

Objective

To determine whether the University of Cincinnati API Index (ucAPI) and/or persistent wheezing at age 3 can accurately predict objectively confirmed asthma at age 7.

Methods

Data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a high-risk prospective birth cohort, was used. Asthma was defined as parent-reported or physician-diagnosed asthma objectively confirmed by a change in FEV1 of ≥ 12% after bronchodilator or a positive methacholine challenge (PC20 ≤ 4 mg/mL); or as prior treatment with daily asthma controller medication(s). Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between confirmed asthma at age 7 and a positive ucAPI (adapted and modified from prior published API definitions) and persistent wheezing at age 3.

Results

At age 7, 103 of 589 children (17.5%) satisfied the criteria for asthma. Confirmed asthma at age 7 was significantly associated with a positive ucAPI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 13.3 [95% CI, 7.0–25.2]; P < .01) and the persistent wheezing phenotype (aOR 9.8 [95% CI, 4.9–19.5]; P < .01) at age 3. Allergic persistent wheezing was associated with a significantly higher risk of asthma (aOR 10.4 [95% CI, 4.1–26.0]; P < .01) than nonallergic persistent wheezing (aOR 5.4 [95% CI, 2.04–14.06]; P < .01).

Conclusion

Both a positive ucAPI and persistent wheeze at age 3 were associated with objectively confirmed asthma at age 7; however, the highest risk was associated with ucAPI. These results demonstrate the ucAPI as a clinically useful tool for predicting future asthma in school-age children.

### Exacerbations in adults with asthma: a systematic review and external validation of prediction models [^115jfVZp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several prediction models assessing future risk of exacerbations in adult patients with asthma have been published. Applicability of these models is uncertain because their predictive performance has often not been assessed beyond the population in which they were derived.

Objective

This study aimed to identify and critically appraise prediction models for asthma exacerbations and validate them in 2 clinically distinct populations.

Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched to April 2017 for reports describing adult asthma populations in which multivariable models were constructed to predict exacerbations during any time frame. After critical appraisal, the models' predictive performances were assessed in a primary and a secondary care population for author-defined exacerbations and for American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society-defined severe exacerbations.

Results

We found 12 reports from which 24 prediction models were evaluated. Three predictors (previous health care utilization, symptoms, and spirometry values) were retained in most models. Assessment was hampered by suboptimal methodology and reporting, and by differences in exacerbation outcomes. Discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [c-statistic]) of models for author-defined exacerbations was better in the primary care population (mean, 0.71) than in the secondary care population (mean, 0.60) and similar (0.65 and 0.62, respectively) for American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society-defined severe exacerbations. Model calibration was generally poor, but consistent between the 2 populations.

Conclusions

The preservation of 3 predictors in models derived from variable populations and the fairly consistent predictive properties of most models in 2 distinct validation populations suggest the feasibility of a generalizable model predicting severe exacerbations. Nevertheless, improvement of the models is warranted because predictive performances are below the desired level.

### Accuracy of eosinophils and eosinophil cationic protein to predict steroid improvement in asthma [^112rTzMF]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is a large variability in clinical response to corticosteroid treatment in patients with asthma. Several markers of inflammation like eosinophils and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), as well as exhaled nitric oxide (NO), are good candidates to predict clinical response.

Aim

We wanted to determine whether we could actually predict a favourable response to inhaled corticosteroids in individual patients.

Methods

One hundred and twenty patients with unstable asthma were treated with either prednisolone 30 mg/day, fluticasone propionate 1000 microg/day b.i.d. or fluticasone propionate 250 microg/day b.i.d., both via Diskhaler. They were treated during 2 weeks, in a double-blind, parallel group, double dummy design. We measured eosinophils and ECP in blood and sputum, and exhaled nitric oxide as inflammatory parameters before and after 2 weeks in order to predict the changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20 Mch), and asthma quality of life (QOL). Secondly, to test whether these results were applicable in clinical practice we determined the individual prediction of corticosteroid response.

Results

We found that changes in FEV1, PC20 Mch and QOL with corticosteroids were predominantly predicted by their respective baseline value and to a smaller extent by eosinophils in blood or sputum. ECP, measured in blood or sputum, was certainly not better than eosinophils in predicting clinical response to corticosteroids. Smoking status was an additional predictor for change in FEV1, but not for change in PC20 Mch or QOL. Prediction of a good clinical response was poor. For instance, high sputum eosinophils (≥ 3%) correctly predicted an improvement in PC20 Mch in only 65% of the patients.

Conclusion

Our findings show that baseline values of the clinical parameters used as outcome parameters are the major predictors of clinical response to corticosteroids. Eosinophil percentage in blood or sputum adds to this, whereas ECP provides no additional information. Correct prediction of clinical response in an individual patient, however, remains poor with our currently used clinical and inflammatory parameters.

### Development and validation of database indexes of asthma severity and control [^112cmNCd]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of administrative databases to perform epidemiological studies in asthma has increased in recent years. The absence of clinical parameters to measure the level of asthma severity and control is a major limitation of database studies. A study was undertaken to develop and validate two database indexes to measure the control and severity of asthma.

Methods

Database indexes of asthma severity and control were derived from definitions in the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines based on dispensed prescriptions and on medical services recorded in two large administrative databases from the Canadian province of Québec (Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and MED-ECHO) over 12 months. The database indexes of asthma severity and control were validated against the pulmonary function test results of 71 patients with asthma randomly selected from two asthma clinics, and they were also applied to a cohort of patients with asthma followed up for 139 283 person-years selected from the RAMQ and MED-ECHO databases between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2004.

Results

According to the database indexes, 49.3%, 29.6% and 21.1% of patients recruited at the asthma clinics were found to have mild, moderate and severe asthma, respectively, while 53.5% were found to have controlled asthma. The mean predicted value of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) ranged from 89.8% for mild asthma to 61.5% for severe asthma (p < 0.001), whereas the range from controlled to uncontrolled asthma was 89.5% to 67.3% (p < 0.001). The ratio of the FEV(1) to the forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC ratio) measured in 56 patients ranged from 75.8% for mild asthma to 61.8% for severe asthma (p = 0.030), whereas the range from controlled to uncontrolled asthma was 75.3% to 65.7% (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

In the absence of clinical data, these database indexes could be used in epidemiological studies to assess the severity and control of asthma.

### Predicting asthma in preschool children with asthma symptoms: study rationale and design [^113rRAqb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

External validation

As a first step we will compare the distribution of the predictors of the PIAMA Risk Score and the asthma outcome in the development (PIAMA) and validation (Generation R) data to determine whether the datasets are comparable. Univariate logistic regression analyses will be performed to establish the effect of the different predictors on asthma at the age of 6 and 9 years. The resulting univariate odds ratios (ORs) will be compared with ORs in the development sample as reported for the PIAMA model. Next, the multivariate PIAMA model will be fitted in the validation sample to compare the multivariate ORs. Finally we will calculate the predicted probability to develop asthma for each child in the validation sample, based on the PIAMA score. These predicted probabilities are used to assess the external validity of the PIAMA model, in terms of calibration and discrimination. Calibration refers to the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes. The extent of over- or underestimation relative to the observed and predicted rate will be explored graphically using validation plots. We will assess calibration-in-the-large by fitting a logistic regression model with the model predictions as an offset variable. The intercept indicates whether predictions are systematically too low or too high, and should ideally be zero. The calibration slope reflects the average effects of the predictors in the model and will be estimated in a logistic regression model with the logit of the model predictions as the only predictor. For a perfect model, the slope is equal to 1. The Concordance-index (C-index) or Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be used to assess the ability of the model to discriminate children with and without asthma. The external validation will also be performed in specific subgroups (e.g. at different ages or in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups of preschool children, see subgroup analysis). To interpret any differences in C-indices, we will consider benchmark values as recently proposed.

### The asthma predictive index: a very useful tool for predicting asthma in young children [^113w6ADu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent wheezing is a common problem in young children: approximately 40% of children wheeze in their first year of life. However, only 30% of preschoolers with recurrent wheezing still have asthma at the age of 6 years. Nevertheless, asthma, the most prevalent chronic disease in children, is difficult to diagnose in infants and preschoolers. This article reviews the importance of determining at an early age which infants/preschoolers will have asthma later in life, analyzes the pros and cons of different predictive indices, and discusses the efficacy of the Asthma Predictive Index.

### A simple diagnostic index for asthma [^115jTujL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is becoming increasingly prevalent and a number of research groups are investigating its genetic and environmental basis.

Objective

To produce a brief screening tool suitable for determining phenotype in asthma research.

Methods

The scores from eight questions on symptoms and history were obtained from 678 adults and 244 children from high asthma-incidence caucasian families. An independent physician diagnosis was also obtained with the use of a modified NHLBI-CSGA questionnaire and pulmonary function test. Stepwise logistic regression was applied to determine which of the eight questions had greatest predictive value for asthma, and the quality of the resultant models was evaluated using an independent set of 643 adults and 239 children.

Results

For adults, the most parsimonious model used responses from three of the eight questions. It had sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. For children, responses to two questions gave a model with sensitivity and specificity of 0.97. For both age groups, negative predictive values were above 0.87. Positive predictive values were 0.58 and 0.78 for adults and children respectively. The latter emphasize the need for conformation, by physician, of "affected" calls made by this initial screen.

Conclusion

The brief questionnaires described are potentially useful in a research setting, as a preliminary screening mechanism of low cost. Their use will reduce the numbers of subjects that must undergo detailed phenotyping.

### External validation of the predicting asthma risk in children tool in a clinical cohort [^11558gLZ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This external validation of the PARC tool in a clinical cohort embedded in routine pediatric pulmonology care suggested that the tool has a role for application in this setting. Currently, it can be used to help identify 1–6‐year old children who are at low risk of having asthma at 2 years of follow‐up, due to its negative predictive value and sensitivity at a cut‐off of 4. Discrimination of the PARC tool between children who will and will not have asthma 2 years later was borderline good highlighting the need for new childhood asthma prediction tools in the clinical setting. We suggest that future efforts to improve asthma prediction in this setting should explore the added value of biomarkers of physiological asthma‐related traits available in pulmonology clinics, such as FeNO, allergy tests, and lung function measurements.

Upper respiratory tract infection (RTI)–triggered yellow zone plan — directive and supporting data: Summary Statement 3 states, "Instruct patients to activate the yellow zone plan at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection if this is a previously identified trigger. (Strong Recommendation: B Evidence)". Supporting context notes strategies of starting intervention at earliest RTI signs versus waiting for symptom increase; intermittent montelukast at first RTI sign "has not been effective in preventing the progression to severe exacerbation requiring OCS", with benefits detected only in children with a positive modified asthma predictive index; intermittent high‑dose fluticasone propionate is described as "750 μg twice daily".

### Does machine learning have a role in the prediction of asthma in children? [^1173piqn]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease in childhood. There has been a significant worldwide effort to develop tools/methods to identify children's risk for asthma as early as possible for preventative and early management strategies. Unfortunately, most childhood asthma prediction tools using conventional statistical models have modest accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. Machine learning is an approach that may improve on conventional models by finding patterns and trends from large and complex datasets. Thus far, few studies have utilized machine learning to predict asthma in children. This review aims to critically assess these studies, describe their limitations, and discuss future directions to move from proof-of-concept to clinical application.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis with these binary predictors was also performed (Table 2). However, given the limited numbers of non-responders, we simplified the prediction model by using a scoring system and avoided having more than two variables in the logistic regression analysis. The final prediction tool included three parameters, and each of them contributed to the prediction score (range from 0 to 5, Table 3 & Fig. 1) with one of three values (0, 1, or 2). It showed similar discriminative ability (AUC = 0.763) when it was compared to the main model (AUC = 0.763) (Fig. 2).

The sensitivity and specificity of this prediction tool for ICS non-responders was 0.75 and 0.69 (Youden index: 0.44), respectively, when the cut-off score was greater than or equal to 3 (Table 4). We could use this score to define three clinical groups for ICS responsiveness. In our study, the percentage of ICS non-responders in children with scores less than or equal to 2 was 16%, compared to 43% (score equal to 3) and 60% (score greater than or equal to 4) in other groups.

### Treating severe asthma: targeting the IL-5 pathway [^111FepW8]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with different phenotypes based on clinical, functional or inflammatory parameters. In particular, the eosinophilic phenotype is associated with type 2 inflammation and increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐4, IL‐5 and IL‐13). Monoclonal antibodies that target the eosinophilic inflammatory pathways (IL‐5R and IL‐5), namely mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, are effective and safe for severe eosinophilic asthma. Eosinophils threshold represents the most indicative biomarker for response to treatment with all three monoclonal antibodies. Improvement in asthma symptoms scores, lung function, the number of exacerbations, history of late‐onset asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, low oral corticosteroids use and low body mass index represent predictive clinical markers of response. Novel Omics studies are emerging with proteomics data and exhaled breath analyses. These may prove useful as biomarkers of response and non‐response biologics. Moreover, future biomarker studies need to be undertaken in paediatric patients affected by severe asthma. The choice of appropriate biologic therapy for severe asthma remains challenging. The importance of finding biomarkers that can predict response continuous an open issue that needs to be further explored. This review describes the clinical effects of targeting the IL‐5 pathway in severe asthma in adult and paediatric patients, focusing on predictors of response and non‐response.

### Inflammatory and clinical risk factors for asthma attacks (ORACLE2): a patient-level meta-analysis of control groups of 22 randomised trials [^113wpFub]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

We identified 976 reports in the literature review. After automated screening of titles and abstracts, we manually reviewed 219 full-text articles (appendix pp 52–66). Of these, 19 publications comprising 23 RCTs met our eligibility criteria (figure 1). Over 2.5 years, nine data sharing agreements were reached with three academic or public data providers and six pharmaceutical data providers to pool IPD from control groups centrally. An overview of the 23 identified RCTs is shown in table 1, with detailed study characteristics of the analysed trials provided in the appendix (pp 74–78). Data from one small RCT were no longer retrievable. Of the 6841 control group patients for whom data were requested, 6513 participants spanning 22 RCTs were included for data analysis (figure 1). All trials except two had a low risk of bias (table 1; appendix p 14)and there was no relevant overlap of participants. Of the 22 analysed trials, 20 were double-blind and two were open-label RCTs.

Table 1
Summary of 19 reports of the 23 identified trials meeting inclusion criteria

5972 (92%) of 6513 patients had moderate-to-severe asthma (treatment steps 3–5). The majority of participants had a history of severe attacks or poor asthma control, but 1280 (20%) of 6400 had not had an attack in the previous year and 929 (15%) of 6055 had at least partly controlled symptoms (ACQ-5 < 1.5). Overall, 4615 attacks over 5482 person-years of follow-up occurred (annualised rate 0.84 per person-year), providing ample power for regression analyses and prediction modelling (table 2). Extended variables and values disaggregated per trial are shown in the appendix (p 79–87).

### AI model for predicting asthma prognosis in children [^112cYJhV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study cohort characteristics

After applying our inclusion criteria, which required that subjects have their PACs index date (ie, first date of asthma onset based on PACs) fall within the observation window and also have EHR data at Mayo Clinic until at least the end of the prediction window (3 years after observation window), we included 357 subjects for a manually annotated cohort (considered the criterion standard) and 2532 subjects for a weakly labeled cohort data (computer-generated labels).

Table I summarizes the basic characteristics of the 2 experimental cohorts (criterion standard and criterion standard + weakly labeled data), showing similar sociodemographic and asthma-related clinical status. As Table I illustrates, the majority of the cohort was non-Hispanic and White, with a significant male prevalence. Socioeconomic status, represented through quartiles of the HOUSES (Housing-Based Socioeconomic Status) index, shows a fairly even distribution across all levels, albeit a slight majority is in the lower SES quartiles.

Table I
Basic characteristics of the 2 cohorts

The proportions of asthma remission between the 2 cohorts are similar, reflecting that the weakly labeled data effectively represents the true nature of the patient cohort (criterion standard). Notably, the remission percentages among patients aged 6 to 9, 9 to 12, and 12 to 15 years show close alignment between the 2 cohorts. Regarding remission of asthma, it has been observed that approximately half of the individuals in each age group achieved remission within the 3-year prediction window.

### Baseline spirometry parameters as predictors of airway hyperreactivity in adults with suspected asthma [^114guhsM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Design

The dataset was randomly split into two cohorts, 75% were assigned to the derivation cohort (n = 2237) and 25% were included in the validation cohort (n = 746). The validation cohort was used to evaluate if the predictive models obtained in the derivation cohort perform similarly for a separate dataset (internal validation).

The following variables were obtained from the dataset and used for analysis: gender, age, weight (kg), height (cm), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (FEF 50%), Forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of forced vital capacity (FEF 25–75%), the methacholine provocation concentration resulting in a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20). Predicted values for FVC, FEV 1, Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), FEF 25–75%, and FEF 50% were based on reference equations from the European Community of Coal and Steel (ECCS), and were also analyzed according to the reference equations from the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI). In addition, the following composite variables were calculated from extracted data: BMI (kg/m 2), FEV 1 /FVC ratio, FEV1/FVC %predicted, FVC %predicted, PEFR %predicted, FEV1%predicted, FEF 50% %predicted and FEF 25–75% %predicted.

To quantify the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve (MEFV), the angle β was calculated using equation in: All tan −1 values were calculated in degrees and defined as the a ngle formed when projecting a line from the PEFR point to the mid flow point on the X-axis (FEF 50%) and then connecting that point to the end point of the forced vital capacity (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

Following ATS guidelines, a negative methacholine challenge result was defined as PC20 > 16 mg/ml, while values of PC20 ≥ 4 to ≤ 16 mg/ml were defined as borderline AHR. For borderline cases the patient's symptoms were assessed by a physician and asthma treatment was initiated if deemed appropriate. For this reason, PC20 ≤ 16 mg/ml was set as the appropriate cut-off level for this study.

### Discriminative properties of two predictive indices for asthma diagnosis in a sample of preschoolers with recurrent wheezing [^116hkijN]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is important to predict if preschool children with recurrent wheezing will suffer from asthma in future years. To aid in this early identification, a number of asthma predictive scores have been reported, such as the asthma predictive index (API) and the PIAMA risk score. However, to the best of our knowledge, their predictive properties have not been evaluated in any lower- to middle-income country.

Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort study was carried out including preschoolers aged 1–3 years with recurrent wheezing who came to our Pediatric Pulmonary Unit in Bogota, Colombia. We collected the information required to complete the API index and the PIAMA risk score. At 5–6 years of age, the patients were contacted in order to determine if they were suffering from active asthma. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the API and PIAMA risk scores for the presence of active asthma at 5–6 years old.

Results

The mean age at recruitment of the 130 included patients was 27.2 ± 5.9 months. The loose API yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI: 50.0–86.2), specificity of 33.3% (95% CI 23.5–44.8), and positive predictive value of 23.8% (95% CI: 15.0–35.6). The stringent API yielded a sensitivity of 42.9% (95% CI: 24.5–63.5), specificity of 79.2% (95% CI 68.4–86.9), positive predictive value of 37.5% (95% CI: 21.2–57.3), and positive LR of 2.06. The PIAMA risk score yielded a sensitivity of 54.5% (95% CI: 42.6–66.0), specificity of 78.9 (95% CI: 66.7–87.5), positive predictive value of 75.0 (95% CI: 61.2–85.1), and positive LR of 2.59.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that both indices can be used to predict asthma in preschoolers with recurrent wheezing in the context of a referral hospital.

### Bronchoalveolar lavage profiles in uncontrolled wheezy children compared by asthma predictive index [^114h5kGd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The asthma predictive index (API) predicts later asthma in preschoolers with frequent wheeze. We hypothesized that airway cytology differs between API positive (API+)/negative (API-) children with uncontrolled/recurrent wheezing with dominance of eosinophils in API+ and neutrophils in API- groups respectively. The main objective of this study is to compare bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell profiles in API+/API- children with recurrent wheezing unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Design

Retrospective analysis of BAL in 43 children, 3–36 months (median: 14 months) receiving ICS (31 API+, 12 API-). BAL cell differential counts, bacterial/viral cultures, and lipid-laden macrophage percentages were analyzed. Cell counts presented as median (range).

Results

Neutrophil percentages were increased in both groups (API- 16% [1%-76%]; API+ 42% [1%-95%]; p = NS). Cell percentages were similar for lymphocytes (API- 12% [1%-30%]; API+ 7% [1%-37%]), and macrophages (API- 67.5% [12%-97%]; API+ 41% [2%-94%]). Eosinophil percentages were low in both groups (API- 1% [1%-2%]; API+ 1% [1%-11%]). There was no difference in cellular distributions using absolute cell counts comparing API groups. Bacterial cultures were positive in 18 (60%) API+ and 5 (41%) API- patients (p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Cell profiles do not differ between API groups in children ≤ 36 months with recurrent wheezing unresponsive to ICS. Neutrophil percentages and total granulocyte count correlate with positive bacterial cultures independent of API status. Persistent bacterial bronchitis likely plays an important role in the persistence of symptoms unresponsive to ICS therapy regardless of API status with a trend to more positive cultures in API positive children.

### Systematic review of clinical prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care [^112CSqEy]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study selection

Retrieved records were de-duplicated, screened and managed using Covidence. Two reviewers (L.D. A.B.) independently screened titles and abstracts. Full-text copies of all relevant records were obtained. Two reviewers (L.D. S. McL.) independently assessed each full-text record for eligibility. Discrepancies were arbitrated by discussion (H.P. S.L. and A.S.).

Data collection process

A standardised data extraction form was developed using CHARMS and piloted. Two reviewers (L.D. S. McL.) independently extracted data from included studies, with disagreements resolved by third reviewer (H.P. S.L. or A.S.). Study authors were contacted if further information or clarification was required. Data were summarised in descriptive tables (Supplementary Table 3).

Critical appraisal of individual studies

Two reviewers (L.D. S. McL.) used the PROBAST to independently evaluate risk of bias and concerns about applicability before reaching a consensus for each included study. According to PROBAST, risk of bias assessment is guided by 20 signalling questions across four domains; participant selection, predictors, outcome and analysis. Each domain is scored low, high or unclear risk of bias and combined to provide an assessment for each study. If a study scores high risk of bias for any domain, PROBAST advises the study to be rated high risk of bias overall. The extent to which each study matched the review question was assessed using PROBAST applicability concern questions. Three domains were assessed; participant selection, predictors and outcome, leading to an overall rating for applicability.

Data synthesis and summary measures

Results were summarised by narrative synthesis as between-study heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses. We summarised the final model presentation and available measures of overall performance, including calibration, discrimination and classification parameters, from each included study. We appraised the strength of association of predictors used in each model against the outcome (asthma) by comparing regression coefficients and odds ratios.

Evaluating confidence in cumulative evidence

We planned to report the overall quality of evidence using GRADE. However, in a change from our protocol, we decided to omit the use of GRADE, as without an adaptation for prediction modelling studies, we did not find it to be a suitable tool. Assessment of publication bias was not completed due to heterogeneity between studies.

### Development and initial testing of asthma predictive index for a retrospective study: an exploratory study [^116oJZhB]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Asthma Predictive Index (API) has been used for predicting asthma in prospective or cross-sectional studies, not for a retrospective study. We aim to develop and validate API for a retrospective study.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional study based on a convenience sample of children who participated in a previous retrospective cohort study. API was operationalized by two or more wheezing episodes in a year during the first 3 years of life PLUS one of the major or two of the minor criteria of the original API. We assessed validity of retrospective API against Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC) which has been extensively used in clinical studies for asthma. We assessed criterion validity by measuring kappa and agreement rate between API and PAC and construct validity by determining associations of API with known risk factors for asthma.

Results

Of the eligible 105 children, 55 (52.4%) were male, 90 (85.7%) Caucasians, and the mean age (± SD) was 5.8 years (± 1.5). API criteria was met by 15 (14.3%), compared to 33 (31.4%) by PAC, respectively. The agreement rate and kappa between API and definite asthma of PAC were 89.5% and 0.66 (p < 0.01). Atopic conditions, lower parental education, no history of breastfeeding and family history of asthma were significantly associated with risk of asthma by API.

Conclusions

Application of API to a retrospective study for ascertaining asthma status is suitable. Our study findings need to be replicated by future studies with a larger sample size.

### Predictive factors for moderate or severe exacerbations in asthma patients receiving outpatient care [^113VffJ3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we prospectively evaluated asthma patients followed up in outpatient pulmonology clinics to determine factors that could predict an SE or ME in the following year. The multiple analysis showed that previous SEs at both the baseline interview and 4-month follow-up is the only predictive factor for SE in the future. The only predictive factor for ME at baseline visit was previous ME, while the 4-month follow-up ACT test score was a predictive factor.

Several different studies have evaluated predictive factors for asthma exacerbations. However, the patient profile in these studies usually differs from ours, which included patients receiving treatment in pulmonology outpatient clinics. Under our inclusion criteria, most patients presented mild or moderate asthma, with a small group of severe asthma patients. Patients with more serious disease and with more previous exacerbations, or those taking oral steroids in the month prior to the baseline interview, were excluded. Our aim in including this type of patient was to study clinical and functional variables and inflammatory parameters without interference from changes in the patient's usual status brought about by intensive recent treatment with oral steroids. In view of the follow-up schedule (4-monthly), we did not include patients whose baseline severity required more frequent follow-up. Because of this, the results of our study cannot, a priori, be generalized to patients with more severe disease. As a result, relatively few of our study subjects presented an SE during follow-up (only 27, or around 8% of the total). Nevertheless, the predictive factor uncovered in the multivariate analysis (previous SE) is consistent with the findings of other studies, such as Miller et al. in 2007, a prospective study of 2,780 patients aged > 12 years in the US diagnosed with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma (TENOR study). In this project, the factor most strongly related with future exacerbations was recent exacerbations (OR 6.33). Other less important predictive factors were severity of disease (severe asthma) and level of control. These data were used in a more recent study that included the same series studied in the TENOR plus a paediatric population (6–11 years). Other studies, such as that conducted by Peters et al. also found that a history of exacerbations can be predictive of future flare-ups in asthmatic adults. Similarly, the retrospective cohort study of UK asthma patients followed-up in primary care centres published by Price et al. found that patients with allergic rhinitis associated with asthma presented more exacerbations (more visits to the doctor and hospitalisation). They also found that patients needing 1 or more courses of oral steroids to treat exacerbations in the preceding year are 3 times more likely to be hospitalised for asthma the following year. In other studies, need for a course of oral steroids has been shown to be a predictor of need for oral steroid in the future.

### Predicting asthma outcomes [^117AaQUk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

This review addresses predictors of remission or persistence of wheezing and asthma from early childhood through adulthood. Early childhood wheezing is common, but predicting who will remit or have persistent childhood asthma remains difficult. By adding parental history of asthma and selected infant biomarkers to the history of recurrent wheezing, the Asthma Predictive Index and its subsequent modifications provide better predictions of persistence than simply the observation of recurrent wheeze. Sensitization, especially to multiple allergens, increases the likelihood of development of classic childhood asthma. Remission is more likely in male subjects and those with milder disease (less frequent and less severe symptoms), less atopic sensitization, a lesser degree of airway hyperresponsiveness, and no concomitant allergic disease. Conversely, persistence is linked strongly to allergic sensitization, greater frequency and severity of symptoms, abnormal lung function, and a greater degree of airway hyperresponsiveness. A genetic risk score might predict persistence more accurately than family history. Remission of established adult asthma is substantially less common than remission during childhood and adolescence. Loss of lung function can begin early in life and tracks through childhood and adolescence. Despite therapy which controls symptoms and exacerbations, the outcomes of asthma appear largely resistant to pharmacologic therapy.

### Inflammatory and clinical risk factors for asthma attacks (ORACLE2): a patient-level meta-analysis of control groups of 22 randomised trials [^115ii1Fd]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Added value of this study

We collaborated with academic, public, and pharmaceutical data providers to access high-quality individual patient data (IPD) from the control groups of 22 randomised controlled trials of asthma, for a total of 4615 attacks over 5482 person-years of follow-up. This first broad consortium in airway disease enabled us to perform a large IPD meta-analysis providing precise estimates of the prognostic value of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers and other characteristics while background therapy was controlled. Our multivariable analyses show that raised blood eosinophil count and FeNO are important, multiplicative, and prevalent predictors of asthma attacks, with synergistic prognostic effects (high-certainty evidence). The prognostic effects of blood eosinophil count and FeNO were incremental to other key risk factors, which our model adjusted for: asthma attack history, disease severity, lower lung function, and symptoms (high-certainty evidence). After adjusting for the presence of type 2 inflammation, we showed that moderate bronchodilator reversibility — traditionally considered the defining characteristic and diagnostic gold standard for asthma — was associated with reduced asthma attack risk (moderate-certainty evidence). These findings imply that clinical risk stratification in asthma should incorporate inflammatory phenotyping using blood eosinophil count and FeNO.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^111f6ARw]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Will symptoms persist in the long term (the prognosis)?

For some children, early wheezing will translate into long-term asthma. This is particularly the case for those with early rhinovirus infections, with sensitisation to aeroallergens and with reduced lung function. The problem is that we cannot, with complete certainty, identify those in whom symptoms will persist and those in whom they will remit. Nevertheless, in the child in our case study, the early frequent and severe episodes in a child with a maternal history of hay fever and possible exposure to environmental smoke may point to a more protracted course of the respiratory symptoms.

Although not widely used in clinical practice, several asthma prediction scores have been developed and published in the last decade, and may usefully inform the history that the healthcare professional needs to take. The clinical asthma prediction score (CAPS), designed specifically for use in general practice, is based on five parameters: age, family history of asthma or allergy, wheezing-induced sleep disturbances, wheezing in the absence of colds, and (if available) specific Immunoglobulin E. The score ranges from 0 to 11 points; CAPS < 3 signifies a negative predictive value of 78% while CAPS ≥ 7 signifies a positive predictive value of 74%. Measurement of specific IgE provides additional value, though the downside is the need for a blood test in a young child.

Prognosis for the 3 year old boy in the case study

Based on the available information, the score in this boy will be at least three (asthma probability 30% at school age) but, with additional information on specific IgE and sleep disturbances, could be as high as nine (asthma probability of 82% at school age). These CAPS scores suggest a policy of either watchful waiting (asthma probability 30–60%) or initiating formal asthma management (asthma probability of 60% or higher). The wide range reflects the current difficulties in predicting prognosis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1111hgEi]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — early warning symptoms and predictors include onset of symptoms of respiratory tract infection, an acute or sub-acute increase in wheeze and shortness of breath, an increase in coughing, especially while the child is asleep, lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impairment of daily activities, including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication. In a study of children aged 2–5 years, the combination of increased daytime cough, daytime wheeze, and night-time beta2 agonist use was a strong predictor at a group level of an imminent exacerbation (1 day later), with this combination predicting around 70% of exacerbations and a low false positive rate of 14%, whereas no individual symptom was predictive. Upper respiratory symptoms frequently precede the onset of an asthma exacerbation, and in a randomized controlled trial of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen for pain or fever in children with mild persistent asthma, there was no evidence of a difference in the subsequent risk of flare-ups or poor symptom control.

### Validation of childhood asthma predictive tools: a systematic review [^114XWirg]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is uncertainty about the clinical usefulness of currently available asthma predictive tools. Validation of predictive tools in different populations and clinical settings is an essential requirement for the assessment of their predictive performance, reproducibility and generalizability. We aimed to critically appraise asthma predictive tools which have been validated in external studies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1946–2017) for all available childhood asthma prediction models and focused on externally validated predictive tools alongside the studies in which they were originally developed. We excluded non-English and non-original studies. PROSPERO registration number is CRD42016035727.

Results

From 946 screened papers, eight were included in the review. Statistical approaches for creation of prediction tools included chi-square tests, logistic regression models and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Predictive models were developed and validated in general and high-risk populations. Only three prediction tools were externally validated: the Asthma Predictive Index, the PIAMA and the Leicester asthma prediction tool. A variety of predictors has been tested, but no studies examined the same combination. There was heterogeneity in definition of the primary outcome among development and validation studies, and no objective measurements were used for asthma diagnosis. The performance of tools varied at different ages of outcome assessment. We observed a discrepancy between the development and validation studies in the tools' predictive performance in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive values.

Conclusions

Validated asthma predictive tools, reviewed in this paper, provided poor predictive accuracy with performance variation in sensitivity and positive predictive value.

### Clinical index for predicting asthma in wheezing infants… [^114RicBg]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, wheezy infants who develop asthma later in childhood coexist with a larger group of their peers who also wheeze in early life but whose symptoms subside by the early school years. Castro-Rodríguez and colleagues evaluated data to determine whether simple clinical indices could reliably predict the subsequent development of asthma in children with wheezing episodes in the first three years of life. Parents were asked to complete questionnaires about their child's history of respiratory conditions and general health at two, three, six, eight, 11 and 13 years of age. The issues specifically addressed were history of physician-diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, as well as presence of wheezing apart from colds. Blood specimens were collected to test for eosinophilia. Two separate indices were constructed for the study.

The "stringent" index required early frequent wheezing during the first three years of life and either one major risk factor or two of three minor risk factors. The "loose" index was defined as early wheezing and either one major risk factor or two minor risk factors. Of the 1, 002 children who had complete information for the stringent index, 63 had a positive index. Of the 986 children who had complete information for the loose index, 233 were positive. Children with a positive loose index for the prediction of asthma were 2. 6 to
5. 5 times more likely to have active asthma at some time during the school years than were children with a negative loose index. The risk of subsequent active asthma increased to 4. 3 to
9. 8 times more likely when the stringent index was used. The positive predictive values of the loose and stringent indexes were 59. 1 and
76.

6 percent, respectively, while the negative predictive values were 73. 2 and
68. 3 percent. The authors conclude that deciding which of the two indexes to apply depends on the efficacy and potential side effects of any preventive measures recommended for at-risk patients. If a potential treatment has high efficacy but significant potential side effects, it should probably only be used in children with a very high risk of disease. Conversely, for a treatment regimen of modest efficacy but few or no side effects, applying a loose index for the prediction of asthma is reasonable.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115MUa2M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The summary of evidence for Recommendation 4 can be found in EtD Table III in Appendix B.

Ten studies addressed the ability of Fmeasures in children younger than 5 years to predict the subsequent development of asthma in children aged 5 years and older. – None of these studies were RCTs; seven studies were nonrandomized longitudinal studies and three were cross-sectional studies. Only four studies investigated the use of Fmeasures to predict the diagnosis of asthma (and not wheezing or Asthma Predictive Index score). In one study in children, a Flevel indicating an increased risk of asthma had a positive predictive value of 58.0% on a composite measure of wheezing, diagnosis of asthma, or use of an ICS at age 7 years, where as the negative predictive value was 78.2%. This result was similar to that for the Asthma Predictive Index score without the use of Flevels. Therefore, although Flevels appear to reflect eosinophilic bronchial inflammation early in life, the current evidence is in sufficient to justify the conclusion that Ftesting in children aged 0 to 4 years reliably predicts a diagnosis of asthma at ages 5 years and above. Future studies may, however, demonstrate otherwise.

Although Flevels appear to reflect T2 inflammation early in life, T2 inflammation is not specific to asthma. Flevels in early childhood (ages 0–4 years) strongly correlate with Asthma Predictive Index scores. This correlation is not surprising because of the relationship between atopy and Flevels and the fact that this index is heavily predicated on an atopic constitution. Flevels are higher in children with wheezing than in children without a recent history of wheezing and in children with persistent wheezing than in those with transient wheezing. Because most children with transient wheezing stop wheezing by age 3 years, young children who continue to wheeze after age 3 years are more likely to develop asthma in the future. Four studies ascertained whether elevated Flevels in children younger than 5 years predicted a future diagnosis of asthma. The studies, which used Fand other clinical measures in different models, had mixed results (see EtD Table III). One longitudinal studyis ongoing and may provide new information on this issue.

### Systematic review of clinical prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care [^1154A3Ux]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018078418). Detailed methods were described in the published protocol, with salient points presented here. We followed the CHARMSand Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).

Study eligibility criteria

Population

Children or adults presenting with symptoms suggestive of asthma in primary care.

Intervention

Any clinical prediction model designed to aid the diagnostic decision-making of a healthcare professional during the assessment of an individual with symptoms suggestive of asthma.

Comparator

Not applicable.

Outcome

The primary outcome to be predicted was the probability of an asthma diagnosis. We included studies that presented a prediction model, or equivalent statistical method, that allowed the probability of asthma to be calculated for an individual. To be included, the study had to use an outcome based on an internationally recognised definition for asthma (as available, for instance, from the Global Initiative for Asthma.)

Timing

Any diagnostic prediction model that provides an estimate for the probability that asthma is present at the time of clinical assessment.

Setting

We included any clinical prediction model designed for use in a primary care population or equivalent (defined as any setting where undifferentiated health problems are presented to healthcare professionals).

Study type

We included prediction model derivation studies (with or without external validation) and external model validation studies. Randomised controlled trials, cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), cross-sectional, nested case–control and case–cohort studies were eligible for inclusion.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded if:
Variables were not combined to produce a diagnostic estimate
Publication occurred before 1 January 1990 (preliminary searches identified no relevant citations before this date)
Variables used in the clinical prediction model were not clearly reported, or unavailable in routine clinical practice (for example genetic tests)
Separate outcomes for asthma were not reported or the asthma outcome was not extractable
The prediction model was derived to predict the future risk of asthma
Over half of study participants were children < 5 years old (because of the overlap between asthma and viral associated wheeze in this age group)
Non-original studies such as editorials, expert views.

Information sources and search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, TRIP and US National Guidelines Clearinghouse databases from 1 January 1990 to 23 November 2017. The search strategy (Supplementary Table 2) combined published searches for prediction models, with Cochrane Airways asthma search terms. Forward and backward citation searching was completed. No language restrictions were used. Studies were translated when necessary.

Risk of bias

All included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. Bias was introduced by various means, though certain limitations were shared by several studies (Table 2). Most notable was the lack of model validation. See Supplementary Note 1 for detailed risk of bias assessment.

Model performance and validation

Three studies reported model performance using classification measures (Table 1), whilst three reported model discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which ranged from 0.61 to 0.82. None of the studies reported model calibration.

Hirsch et al.conducted internal validation, but did not report model performance. Metting et al.conducted an internal (10-fold cross) validation and external validation of the final decision tree using data from a different asthma/COPD referral service within the Netherlands. Model performance (derived from available data; no confidence intervals (CIs) available) was similar in the derivation (sensitivity 0.79, specificity 0.75) and validation datasets (sensitivity 0.78, specificity 0.60). Five studies reported no validation, with model performance likely to be over-estimated in these cases.,

Model presentation

Of the six studies that derived a prediction model using logistic regression, four presented a scoring system, one a web-based clinical calculatorand one presented model output from which a probability could be calculated. The decision tree had six 'branches' of predictors that led to a probability of asthma, though this approach limited the number of predictor combinations.

Model outcome measures

Four studies based their outcome measure on bronchial challenge testing;, an asthma diagnosis was indicated by a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) from baseline after stepwise inhalation of methacholine up to a maximum 8 mg/mlor 16 mg/ml.

Expert opinion informed the outcome in two studies. Hirsch et al.used a panel of three experts, whilst Metting et al.used one of ten respiratory specialists to make a diagnosis. In one study, healthcare providers made an asthma diagnosis when a child demonstrated reversible episodic symptoms, indicated by spirometry or symptom resolution.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114Hb5jc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

FENO measurement for exacerbation assessment and asthma control: Among children and adults, FENO levels did not correlate with exacerbation severity, and in children in the acute setting FENO testing was difficult to perform, did not correlate with other measures of acute severity, and was poorly reproducible; based on this evidence, the Expert Panel recommends against the use of FENO measurement to assess asthma control, predict future exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity unless these measurements are used as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy as described in Recommendation 2, and further research is needed on its role as a marker for medication adherence and its impact on outcomes, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.

### Systematic review of clinical prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care [^1168LAyE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma is challenging. Misdiagnosis can lead to untreated symptoms, incorrect treatment and avoidable deaths. The best combination of clinical features and tests to achieve a diagnosis of asthma is unclear. As asthma is usually diagnosed in non-specialist settings, a clinical prediction model to aid the assessment of the probability of asthma in primary care may improve diagnostic accuracy. We aimed to identify and describe existing prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in children and adults in primary care. We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, TRIP and US National Guidelines Clearinghouse databases from 1 January 1990 to 23 November 17. We included prediction models designed for use in primary care or equivalent settings to aid the diagnostic decision-making of clinicians assessing patients with symptoms suggesting asthma. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. From 13,798 records, 53 full-text articles were reviewed. We included seven modelling studies; all were at high risk of bias. Model performance varied, and the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.61 to 0.82. Patient-reported wheeze, symptom variability and history of allergy or allergic rhinitis were associated with asthma. In conclusion, clinical prediction models may support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care, but existing models are at high risk of bias and thus unreliable for informing practice. Future studies should adhere to recognised standards, conduct model validation and include a broader range of clinical data to derive a prediction model of value for clinicians.

### Intermittent montelukast in children aged 10 months to 5 years with wheeze (WAIT trial): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^1161iP99]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the 95% CI of the IRR for unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze excluded a 33% reduction in such attendances. However, the fewer unscheduled medical attendances in the montelukast group, albeit non-significant, suggests heterogeneity of treatment response — a characteristic of previous studies in young children with wheeze. For example, response to continuous inhaled corticosteroids is most favourable in the subgroup of white males with an unscheduled medical attendance for wheeze in the previous 12 months and aeroallergen sensitisation. Furthermore, in Bacharier and colleagues' study, intermittent montelukast, despite having no overall benefit, reduced the area under the curve for wheezing score in children with a positive asthma predictive index, defined as four or more wheezing episodes with at least one diagnosed by a doctor, and one or more major criteria of parental asthma, doctor-diagnosed dermatitis, allergic sensitisation to one or more aeroallergen, or at least two minor criteria of allergic sensitisation to milk, egg, or peanuts; wheeze unrelated to colds; and blood eosinophils greater than 4%. We did not stratify by asthma predictive index because Meyer and colleaguesreported that no clinical variable predicts response to continuous montelukast in wheeze in young children, and blood sampling, in our experience, greatly reduces the willingness of parents to enter their infants into a therapeutic trial. Furthermore, use of parental-reported diagnosis for disorders such as eczema overestimates physician-diagnosed disease. As such, we cannot exclude montelukast responsiveness in children with a positive asthma predictive index. However, our prespecified subgroup analyses showed that neither the pattern of wheeze nor use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with montelukast response, although our study was not powered for these interactions.

### External validation of the predicting asthma risk in children tool in a clinical cohort [^115vhuxU]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Other asthma predictive tools have been developed for preschool children in clinical settings. A retrospective study by Boersma et al.that aimed to examine how senitization to inhalant allergens among wheezing toddlers in secondary healthcare predicted asthma development, demonstrated an improvement in the AUC from 0.70 to 0.79 when it included invasive senitization measures compared to when they used only International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questions. Vial Dupuy et al.developed and independently validated the Persistent Asthma Predicting Score in a clinical setting. They defined the outcome as "persistent" asthma. Predictors included: family history of asthma, personal history of atopic dermatitis and immunoglobulin E (IgE) senitization. Their analysis demonstrated an AUC of 0.66 in the development population and 0.65 in the internal validation population demonstrating low overall discrimination of the tool. In a clinical setting including corticosteroid‐naïve 3–47 month‐old children in Zürich, Switzerland, Singer et al.performed an external validation of a modified asthma predictive index (API) tool. They used an outcome of physician‐diagnosed asthma and included FeNO as a predictor. Their analysis showed good discrimination with AUC of 0.76 when FeNO was used instead of blood eosinophilia, as per the original API tool. Rodriguez‐Martinez et al.implemented the loose API and modified Prevalence and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) tools in a clinical setting in Bogota, Columbia. They reported a sensitivity and specificity for predicting asthma at age 5–6 years in preschoolers with recurrent wheeze of 71.4% and 33.3% (loose API) and 54.5% and 78.9% (modified PIAMA) for ideal receiver operator curves cut‐off points. The authors suggested that these prediction tools could therefore be applicable in clinical practice. In our external validation, the PARC tool had an NPV of 83%, PPV of 46%, and sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 50%, respectively at a PARC score of 7, which suggests that it also has scope for clinical application.

### Screening tools for work-related asthma and their diagnostic accuracy: a systematic review [^114xLNJ9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The addition of objective test(s), as expected, improved the specificity of screening questionnairesand increased AUC in the diagnostic model. Similarly, the study of the prediction model for laboratory animal sensitisation showed that the addition of skin-prick test and/or methacholine challenge test could improve the specificityand the AUC of the model. However, these objective tests are not routinely used in primary care settings, but rather in secondary care, due to their specialised procedures/interpretations, limited access and safety considerations.

### Automated chart review utilizing natural language processing algorithm for asthma predictive index [^114D6N5w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma predictive index (API)

The presence of asthma was defined if frequent wheezing episodes (i.e. two or more wheezing episodes within one year) AND either one of the major criteria or two of the minor criteria are satisfied (Table 1); otherwise, study subjects were considered non-asthmatics. An index date of asthma was defined as the earliest date when the API criteria were met. The operational procedures for API for retrospective studies were described in a previous study.

Table 1
Asthma Predictive Index (API) for asthma a ascertainment

a Asthma is determined by frequent wheezing episodes (two or more wheezing episodes within one year) plus at least one of major criteria or two of minor criteria

Development of NLP algorithm for API

The overall process for the NLP-API algorithm to ascertain asthma status is depicted in Fig. 1. Our NLP algorithm used three different sources of data — i.e. clinical notes, laboratory data, and patient-provided information. Parents' asthma information (one of major criteria) was identified from both clinical notes (family history section of the patient's chart) and patient-provided information, and an eosinophil value was extracted from the lab data if tested for any reason. The other items of API criteria (i.e. eczema, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing ± colds) were extracted from clinical notes using pattern-based rules, assertion status (e.g. non-negated, associated with patient), and section constraints (e.g. diagnosis section). Then, we developed expert rules implementing API criteria (Table 1). Our algorithm was built in the open-source NLP pipeline MedTagger developed by Mayo Clinic. In this pipeline, there are two basic conceptual blocks to identify API-positive asthmatics. 1) A text processing component which finds evidence text in EHRs to match specific API criteria, and 2) A patient classification component which decides the patient's API status based on available evidence.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^117UbH85]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Research needs for mild asthma treatments — suggested research priorities include identifying patients who need daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment rather than ICS used whenever an as-needed reliever is taken; determining whether ICS-containing treatment is required in all mild asthma populations; defining who benefits most from ICS in terms of exacerbation reduction and symptom control; conducting real-world and long-term studies of as-needed ICS plus rapid-acting bronchodilator regimens; evaluating ICS benefits in patients with elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO); determining whether strategies should differ between adolescents and adults; identifying predictors of treatment response and the predictive value of T2 biomarkers; comparing as-needed ICS–SABA with SABA alone, as-needed ICS–formoterol, and maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA in newly diagnosed and mild asthma; investigating twice-weekly fluticasone furoate–LABA as a step-down option; assessing stepwise algorithms across asthma severity; addressing beliefs/behaviors about SABA-only treatment and communicating population-level risk reduction strategies; exploring biologics in well-characterized mild asthma (including biomarker identification for corticosteroid refractoriness); standardizing allergen immunotherapy outcomes; characterizing responders to allergen immunotherapy; and conducting head-to-head comparative studies versus other therapies.

### Asthma score: predictive ability and risk factors [^116P4pwk]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Definition of asthma as a continuous score is a promising tool for population studies that has not yet been fully evaluated.

Objective

We assessed (i) the predictive ability of an asthma score against the occurrence of different asthma-related outcomes and (ii) the risk factors identified when using an asthma score.

Methods

The European Community Respiratory Health Study II included subjects from the general population randomly studied during 1991–1993 who were followed up in the years 1998–2001, from 29 centres in 14 countries. A total of 8956 subjects were included. The asthma score consisted of a simple sum of the positive answers to five respiratory symptoms.

Results

Asthma score at baseline showed a linear relationship with incidence of asthma, the occurrence of asthma attacks, use of asthma medication and bronchial reactivity at the end of the follow-up. Asthma score at the end of follow-up was associated with known risk factors at baseline such as IgE to grass, rhinitis or body mass index, in addition to passive smoking in men [average score ratio (RR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.50] or changes in body mass index (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.05–1.27, per each kg/m(2)).

Conclusion

The asthma score had good predictive ability against outcomes related with asthma and also good ability to detect risk factors. This encourages the use of the score as a measure of asthma in epidemiological studies on aetiology of asthma.

### Development and validation of personalized prediction to estimate future risk of severe exacerbations and uncontrolled asthma in patients with asthma, using clinical parameters and early treatment response [^113Rua6U]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current level of asthma control can be easily assessed by validated instruments, but it is currently difficult to assess individuals' level of future risk.

Objective

Develop, and validate, a risk prediction score for level of future risk, including patient characteristics and information on early treatment response.

Methods

We used data of 304 adult patients with asthma from a 12-month primary care randomized controlled trial with 3-monthly assessments. With logistic regression we modeled the association between the level of future risk and patient characteristics including early treatment response. Future risk was defined as Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score of 1.5 or more at 12 months or the experience of at least 1 exacerbation during the final 6 months. We developed a risk prediction score on the basis of regression coefficients.

Results

Performance of the risk prediction score improved, taking into account data on early treatment response (area under receiver-operating curve [AUROC] = 0.84) compared with a model containing only baseline characteristics (AUROC = 0.78). The score includes 6 easy-to-obtain predictors: sex, ACQ score and exacerbations in the previous year at baseline and at first follow-up, and smoking status and exacerbations in the previous 3 months (indicating early treatment response). External validation yielded an AUROC of 0.77. The risk prediction score classified patients into 3 risk groups: low (absolute risk, 11.7%), intermediate (47.0%), and high (72.7%).

Conclusions

We developed and externally validated a risk prediction score, quantifying both level of current asthma control and the guideline-defined future risk. Patients' individual risk can now be estimated in an easy way, as proposed but not specified, by asthma management guidelines.

### Diagnostic accuracy of FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio z scores in asthmatic patients [^111gkcfG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is used as a criterion for airflow obstruction; however, the test characteristics of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma are not well established. The accuracy of a test depends on the pretest probability of disease.

Objective

We wanted to estimate the FEV1/FVC ratio z score threshold with optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of asthma for different pretest probabilities.

Methods

Asthmatic patients enrolled in 4 trials from the Asthma Clinical Research Centers were included in this analysis. Measured and predicted FEV1/FVC ratios were obtained, with calculation of z scores for each participant. Across a range of asthma prevalences and z score thresholds, the overall diagnostic accuracy was calculated.

Results

One thousand six hundred eight participants were included (mean age, 39 years; 71% female; 61% white). The mean FEV1 percent predicted value was 83% (SD, 15%). In a symptomatic population with 50% pretest probability of asthma, optimal accuracy (68%) is achieved with a z score threshold of -1.0 (16th percentile), corresponding to a 6 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. However, in a screening population with a 5% pretest probability of asthma, the optimum z score is -2.0 (second percentile), corresponding to a 12 percentage point reduction from the predicted ratio. These findings were not altered by markers of disease control.

Conclusion

Reduction of the FEV1/FVC ratio can support the diagnosis of asthma; however, the ratio is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnostic accuracy. When interpreting spirometric results, consideration of the pretest probability is an important consideration in the diagnosis of asthma based on airflow limitation.

### Impact of clinical characteristics and biomarkers on asthma impairment and risk questionnaire exacerbation prediction ability [^111DCjJx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex models combining impairment-based control assessments with clinical characteristics and biomarkers have been developed to predict asthma exacerbations. The composite Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire (AIRQ) with adjustments for demographics (age, sex, race, and body mass index) predicts 12-month exacerbation occurrence similarly to these more complex models.

Objective

To examine whether AIRQ exacerbation prediction is enhanced when models are adjusted for a wider range of clinical characteristics and biomarkers.

Methods

Patients aged 12 years and older completed monthly online surveys regarding exacerbation-related oral corticosteroid use, emergency department or urgent care visits, and hospitalizations. Univariate logistic regressions to predict exacerbations were performed with sociodemographics, comorbidities, exacerbation history, lung function, blood eosinophils, IgE, and FeNO. Significant (P ≤ .05) variables were included in multivariable logistic regressions with and without AIRQ control categories to predict 12-month exacerbations (log odds ratio [95% Wald confidence interval]). Model performances were compared.

Results

Over 12 months, 1,070 patients (70% female; mean [SD] age, 43.9 [19.4] years; 22% non-White; body mass index [SD], 30.6 [8.7]) completed one or more survey (mean [SD], 10.5 [2.8] surveys). In the multivariable analysis, AIRQ control category adjusted for significant clinical characteristics and biomarkers was predictive of one or more exacerbations: odds ratio (95% CI) not well-controlled versus well-controlled: 1.93 (1.41–2.62), very poorly controlled versus well-controlled: 3.81 (2.65–5.47). Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) for this more complex model of exacerbation prediction (AUC = 0.72) did not differ from AIRQ (AUC = 0.70). Models with AIRQ performed better than those without AIRQ (AUC = 0.67; P < .05).

Conclusion

Costly and time-consuming complex modeling with clinical characteristics and biomarkers does not enhance the strong exacerbation prediction ability of AIRQ.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116wPPJ7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society — mild asthma treatments research priorities are to identify patients who need daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–containing treatment and determine if ICS-containing treatment is required in all populations with mild asthma, identify populations that will benefit most from ICS therapy, and conduct real-world and long-term follow-up studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of as-needed ICS plus rapid-acting bronchodilator regimens. Additional priorities are to evaluate the benefits of ICS therapy in patients with elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) concentrations but otherwise controlled mild asthma, identify whether treatment strategies should differ between adolescents and adults, and identify predictors of treatment response in mild asthma including whether the predictive value of type 2 (T2) biomarkers varies by the criteria chosen to define ICS response. Comparative treatment questions are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of as-needed ICS plus a short-acting β-2 agonist (SABA) compared with a SABA alone, versus as-needed ICS–formoterol, versus maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA in newly diagnosed and mild asthma; investigate fluticasone furoate plus long-acting β-2 agonist for twice-weekly use as a step-down option compared with continuing daily treatment; and assess the efficacy and safety of stepwise algorithms across the range of asthma severity, including mild asthma. Further research is to investigate how beliefs and behaviors about SABA-only treatment can be changed and how to communicate population-level risk reduction strategies when symptoms are infrequent, explore the effect of biologics in well-characterized patients with mild asthma including identifying biomarkers for relative corticosteroid refractoriness, and optimize allergen immunotherapy (AIT) by standardizing outcomes, characterizing responders, and conducting head-to-head comparative studies to assess the size of effect compared with other therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114pBjSU]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — criteria for hospitalization versus discharge from the emergency department prioritize that clinical status and lung function 1 hour after treatment are more reliable predictors than arrival status, and provide spirometric thresholds and risk factors to guide decisions. Hospitalization is recommended if pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 25% predicted or personal best, or if post-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 40% predicted or personal best. Discharge may be possible when post-treatment lung function is 40–60% predicted after considering patient risk factors and availability of follow-up care, and discharge is recommended when post-treatment lung function is > 60% predicted or personal best after considering risk factors and follow-up care availability. Other factors associated with increased likelihood of admission include female sex, older age and non-white race; use of more than eight beta2 agonist puffs in the previous 24 hours; severity indicators such as respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation < 95%, and final PEF < 50% predicted; past history of severe exacerbations; and previous unscheduled office and emergency department visits requiring use of OCS.

### Evaluation of risk scores to predict pediatric severe asthma exacerbations [^111qsQrW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations commonly lead to unplanned health care utilization and are costly. Early identification of children at increased risk of asthma exacerbations would allow a proactive management approach.

Objective

We evaluated common asthma risk factors to predict the probability of exacerbation for individual children aged 0–21 years using data from the electronic medical record (EMR).

Methods

We analyzed longitudinal EMR data for over 3000 participants with asthma seen at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center over a 7-year period. The study population was divided into 3 age groups: 0–4, 5–11, and 12–21 years. Each age group was divided into a derivation cohort and a validation cohort, which were used to build a risk score model. We predicted risk of exacerbation in the next 12 months, validated the scores by risk stratum, and developed a clinical tool to determine the risk level based on this model.

Results

Risk model results were confirmed with validation cohorts by calendar year and age groups. Race, allergic sensitization, and smoke exposure were each important risk factors in the 0–4 age group. Abnormal spirometry and obesity were more sensitive predictors of exacerbation in children > 12 years. For each age group, a higher expanded score was associated with a higher predicted probability of an asthma exacerbation in the subsequent year.

Conclusion

This asthma exacerbation prediction model, and the associated clinical tool, may assist clinicians in identifying children at high risk for exacerbation that may benefit from more aggressive management and targeted risk mitigation.

### Early intestinal Bacteroides fragilis colonisation and development of asthma [^117LC7az]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first prospective cohort study that links gut flora to API (a clinically relevant risk factor for developing asthma) at the age of 3 years. It was demonstrated that differences in gut flora precede the development of asthma: early colonisation with Bacteroides fragilis was more often found in recurrent wheezing children at risk of persistent asthma at school age. Differences in feeding or use of antibiotics cannot explain the findings.

Between 25 and 50% of children suffer from one or more wheezing episodes below the age of 6. However, wheezing illness below the age of 6 years is not a single disease, but comprises several distinct disorders. Asthma phenotypes have been identified in epidemiologic trials, each with their own risk factors and different outcome. Overall, 30–40% of the children presenting with wheezing below the age of 3, will wheeze later in life. Decreased airway calibre could be an important factor in pathophysiology, explaining the transient nature of wheeze in many children. The diagnosis is not straightforward since no simple clinical tools are available to discriminate children prone to develop persistent asthma from those who will not. The 'Asthma Prediction Index' has been associated with an increased risk for asthma at school age. This index was chosen as outcome parameter for the study since it is at present the best tool for prediction of asthma at school age. A 'stringent' index that required subjects to have wheezed more frequently in early life combined with risk factors for asthma had an acceptable positive predictive value (e.g. at age 13: 51%) and a very high specificity (97%), but its sensitivity was quite low (15%). Conversely, a more 'loose' index, which only required infrequent wheezing episodes plus the same combination of other risk factors included in the 'stringent' index had a much higher sensitivity (39%) but lower specificity (82%) and positive predictive values (32%). The negative predictive value at all ages was very high for both indices, suggesting that the great majority of children who did not develop asthma during the school years had a negative predicted index during the first years of life. Because the Asthma Predictive Index is only an approximation to predict which children will subsequently develop persistent asthma, further follow-up at school age is required to definitely determine the relation between early Bacteroides fragilis colonisation and asthma.

### Predictive factors for moderate or severe exacerbations in asthma patients receiving outpatient care [^116WabSF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations are important events that affect disease control, but predictive factors for severe or moderate exacerbations are not known. The objective was to study the predictive factors for moderate (ME) and severe (SE) exacerbations in asthma patients receiving outpatient care.

Methods

Patients aged > 12 years with asthma were included in the study and followed-up at 4-monthly intervals over a 12-month period. Clinical (severity, level of control, asthma control test [ACT]), atopic, functional, inflammatory, SE and ME parameters were recorded. Univariate analysis was used to compare data from patients presenting at least 1 SE or ME during the follow-up period vs no exacerbations. Statistically significant (p < 0.1) factors were then subjected to multiple analysis by binary logistic regression.

Results

A total of 330 patients completed the study, most of whom were atopic (76%), women (nearly 70%), with moderate and mild persistent asthma (> 80%). Twenty-seven patients (8%) had a SE and 183 had a ME (58.5%) during follow-up. In the case of SEs, the only predictive factor identified in the multiple analysis was previous SE (baseline visit OR 4.218 95% CI 1.53–11.58, 4-month follow-up OR 6.88 95% CI 2.018–23.51) and inhalation technique (OR 3.572 95% CI 1.324–9.638). In the case of MEs, the only predictive factor found in the multiple analysis were previous ME (baseline visit OR 2.90 95% CI 1.54–5.48, 4-month follow- up OR 1.702 95% CI 1.146–2.529).

Conclusions

The primary predictive factor for SE or ME is prior SE or ME, respectively. SEs seem to constitute a specific patient "phenotype", in which the sole predictive factor is prior SEs.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), measured as the provocative dose of inhaled histamine or methacholine required to produce a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (PD20), is widely used as one of the indices of asthma severity. Excessive bronchoconstriction, reflected by the maximal percentage fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) at PD20 (deltaFVC %) during BHR testing, is considered to be the most important pathophysiological determinant in fatal asthma. The present study hypothesized that an index which combines both the ease of airway narrowing and excessive bronchoconstriction, deltaFVC %/log(PD20), may be better in assessing asthma severity, especially in those at risk of near-fatal attacks. The dose-response curves of 46 asthmatics who underwent methacholine challenge testing were studied. Group 1 (n = 14) patients had mild disease, Group 2 (n = 21) had moderate disease and Group 3 (n = 11) had severe disease, as classified according to the Global Initiative for Asthma. Nine patients had prior intubation for near-fatal asthma. deltaFVC %/log (PD20) was better than deltaFVC % and PD20 in categorizing patients into the three severity groups (p < 0.0001), but more importantly, it was able to discriminate patients with previous intubation from those without (p = 0.04). It also correlated better with FEV1 (% predicted), frequency of symptoms and inhaled steroid requirement than either index alone. It is concluded that the percentage fall in forced vital capacity/log of the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second combines information on the ease and excessive degrees of airway narrowing in asthma. This new index may be better at assessing asthma severity and in discriminating those at risk of near-fatal attacks.

### Assessment of severity measures for acute asthma outcomes: a first step in developing an asthma clinical prediction rule [^114DWxir]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

As a first step in the development of an asthma prediction rule, our primary objective was to assess the association of 8 candidate predictor variables with 2 clinically relevant asthma outcomes.

Methods

Among a cohort of 125 adults hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation, we examined models to identify clinical variables associated with length of stay (LOS) and clinically significant asthma exacerbations within 3 months after hospitalization (3-month exacerbation). Eight candidate predictor variables were chosen, including age, sex, race, pulsus paradoxus, prior endotracheal intubation for asthma, hospitalization within 5 years for asthma, and 2 chronic asthma severity scores.

Results

We found independent associations between LOS and pulsus paradoxus (P = 0.005), prior intubation (P = 0.03), sex (P = 0.03), and prior hospitalization (P = 0.019). Among men, 52% had a 3-month exacerbation in comparison with 25% of women; and in multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with 3-month exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.37–18.9; p = 0.015). Participants with 3-month exacerbation had higher Johns Hopkins Allergy and Asthma Composite (JHAAC) chronic severity scores (median = 77; interquartile range = 57–91) than those who did not (median = 54; interquartile range = 35–69; P < .001) (for 40-unit increase, adjusted OR for 3-month exacerbation = 1.54; 95% confidence interval = 1.16–2.03; p = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, male sex and the JHAAC severity score were independently associated with 3-month exacerbation.

Conclusions

Elevated pulsus paradoxus, prior intubation for asthma, and 5-year asthma hospitalization are independently associated with LOS. Race, 5-year asthma hospitalization, and JHAAC score predict 3-month asthma exacerbation. These variables warrant consideration for use in the development of an asthma prediction rule.

### Variability and lack of predictive ability of asthma end-points in clinical trials [^113PLa5x]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

While a consensus definition of the clinical parameters important in asthma control exists, an adequate objective definition of a response to asthma treatment and parameters for prediction of that response remain undefined. Given that asthma is a complex biological disease and that different parameters may measure dissimilar aspects of the disease status, this study assessed the relationship among several end-points of asthma control, and attempted to select a combination of variables measured before (baseline characteristics) or early in asthma therapy which would be predictive of a long-term clinical response. Data from two previously reported clinical studies which included montelukast, inhaled beclomethasone, and placebo in mild-to-moderate asthmatics (n = 1,576) were analysed. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), daily symptoms score (DSS), beta-agonist use, and morning peak expiratory flow (PEFAM) were recorded during the baseline period and throughout the 12-week treatment period. For the long-term response, as measured during the last 9 weeks of treatment, there was a large within-patient variability and no more than a moderate correlation between the changes in FEV1 and PEFAM; DSS and FEV1; and DSS and beta-agonist use. The overall predictive values for FEV1 and DSS were 70–80%. The results showed that multiple measurements over a length of time are needed to establish a more complete profile of response, and that demographic and early treatment responses had a small but inadequate ability to predict future response. This study demonstrates the complex relationship among asthma end-points and the difficulty of reliably estimating long-term response using common, surrogate clinical markers of asthma control.

### Development of a risk prediction model to predict the risk of hospitalization due to exacerbated asthma among adult asthma patients in a lower middle-income country [^112K2zYG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We aimed to develop a simple, low-cost, risk prediction tool that would be applicable to primary healthcare settings to identify at-risk asthma patients for hospitalization. The model was developed incorporating simple, measurable risk predictors that can be easily obtained from the history and examination of patients. This enabled application of the model in low-resource settings at the first contact care level. A simple ten-question interviewer-administered tool was designed to obtain information on risk predictors. A simple risk score was given to each asthma patient by this tool, which would allow clinicians to stratify patients for proactive management within the existing busy clinic setups.

Existing risk prediction models on asthma hospitalizations are either applicable to specialized populations, predictions are purely based on literature and statistical methods or are designed to predict different outcomes such as hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. Furthermore, the predictive performance of these models has often not been assessed beyond the population from which they were derived.

The present risk prediction model was primarily based on adjusted risk factors for asthma-related hospitalizations derived from a case-control study conducted among adult asthma patients in four local healthcare settings. Therefore, this model is more valid for local settings to apply to adult asthma patients. In identifying candidate predictors for the model, the opinion of experts in the field was also considered in addition to the statistical method. This allowed us to develop a more comprehensive and clinically relevant model. As prediction is all about estimation rather than testing of risk factors, it is recommended to include clinically relevant and reliable predictors for a risk prediction model.

Most of the asthma-specific risk prediction tools have utilized a lot of clinical information as predictors which would be costly in obtaining at a large scale. Other tools have incorporated subtle physical findings like accessory muscle use, spirometry or peak expiratory flow rate variability which may reduce the feasibility of the tool and thereby the acceptance in the routine clinical practice. The ability to verify all risk predictors in the present model from a short history and examination is an advantage in the utilization of this model even in busy clinic settings.

### Predicting persistence of asthma in preschool wheezers: crystal balls or muddy waters? [^111pwP5X]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Since preschool wheezing is the common expression of several heterogeneous disorders, identification of children at risk for persistent asthma is particularly challenging. To date, efforts to predict the outcome of preschool wheeze have mainly relied on predictive rules consisting of simple clinical and laboratory parameters. Among these tools, the asthma predictive index (API) has been introduced in international guidelines and position papers and is recommended for use in clinical practice. This article reviews the currently available asthma predictive models focusing on their validity and performance characteristics. Although these tools are generally simple and easy to apply, they suffer important intrinsic and practical limitations and they have been insufficiently validated to allow for widespread use in clinical settings. We also present evidence that their ability to predict the long-term outcome of preschool wheeze is limited in general populations, and even poorer in high-risk children in which prediction of asthma persistence might have important clinical and prognostic implications. Due to the complex and multifactorial nature of asthma, prediction of asthma persistence based on simple clinical models is practically impossible.

### Predictive value of respiratory symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to diagnose asthma in New Zealand [^113wRbVe]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Respiratory symptoms are often used as the only diagnostic criteria for asthma in epidemiological surveys and the clinical diagnosis of asthma relies primarily on a detailed history. The aim of this study is to predict the diagnostic value of 11 different respiratory symptoms to diagnose asthma, and to determine if bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) improves the predictive value of these respiratory symptoms. A random sample of 1257 subjects aged 20–44 years old in 3 different areas of New Zealand were selected between March 1991 and December 1992 to answer the European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire on respiratory symptoms. Of these, 784 underwent bronchial challenge with methacholine. The prevalence of current doctor diagnosed asthma (DDA) defined as asthma confirmed by a physician and an asthma attack in the last 12 months was 8.3%. Wheezing with dyspnoea is the single best predictor of diagnosed asthma with a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 90% and a Youden's index of 0.72. Wheezing alone is more sensitive (94%) but less specific (76%), with a Youden's index of 0.70. The addition of BHR to asthma symptoms decreases sensitivity and increases specificity with a small increase in Youden's index to 0.75. In New Zealand adults, a history of wheezing with BHR best predicts a diagnosis of asthma but wheezing alone or with dyspnoea are the two best symptoms for predicting asthma.

### Automated chart review utilizing natural language processing algorithm for asthma predictive index [^113sCMn3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The main strength of our study is the epidemiological advantages of conducting retrospective studies in a study setting that is virtually a self-contained health care environment. In addition, under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we were able to capture all inpatient and outpatient asthma-related events for this present study from birth to the last follow-up date. Our NLP algorithm has a unique capability to determine asthma index (inception) date, which helps researchers discern temporality. An additional strength of this study is the unique aspect of NLP algorithm incorporating free-text data (e.g. asthma symptoms), lab data (e.g. eosinophil count), and structured data (e.g. self-reported response collected at clinic visit).

Limitations of our study includes a retrospective study design with a relatively small sample size, and thus, we were not able to fully address the associations between asthma status and certain risk factors such as second-hand smoking exposure and breastfeeding history. Although it was not statistically significant, NLP-API still showed strong associations with the expected direction for these factors. Another potential limitation is the portability of applying NLP-API to different EHR and health care systems. Appropriate adjustments to NLP algorithms may be necessary to address the intrinsic heterogeneity of EHR in order to produce a desirable performance of NLP algorithms at a different study setting. While our previous study demonstrated the portability of NLP asthma ascertainment tool based on a different asthma criteria using EHR, the study result of NLP-API needs to be validated in different clinical settings to ensure the portability. In addition, there were the difficulties of semantic understanding of complex assertion status in clinical narratives (e.g. identifying asthma-related concepts that are negated, hypothetical, or associated with other family members), resulting in false negatives and false positives. Intrinsic limitation of EHR reliability collected from the sources may not represent complete history of patient's conditions (eg, parents' asthma collected from family history section and patient provided information) and thus affect the final asthma ascertainment. Our earlier work based on a prospective cohort study showed a close correlation between medical events (mild acute illnesses) in EMR and those captured by prospective follow up. Lastly, our cohorts used for the training (Mayo Clinic sick child care cohort) and test (preterm-weighted cohort) from a single center may not represent general population in children.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

### Individual risk assessment tool for school-age asthma prediction in UK birth cohort [^111hoqED]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Preschool wheeze is prevalent 1, 2 and incorporates several different phenotypes, with varying prognosis. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 In some children it is transient; in others it may indicate early signs of persistent asthma. In clinical practice, the identification of the children with preschool wheeze who are at high risk of developing asthma in later childhood may aid parents and facilitate clinicians in early risk stratification, allowing closer follow‐up for those at risk.

Asthma predictive tools have been developed previously, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and likelihood ratios (LR) have been frequently used to assess and validate the predictabilities of these tools. 10, 14, 15, 16 High positive LRs (+LR) "rule‐in" the disease when the test is positive, while low negative LRs (−LR) "rule‐out" the disease when the test is negative. 17, 18 For a good predictive tool, a high +LR and a low −LR are required. 14 A +LR of > 10 and a −LR of < 0.1 are likely to have substantial impact on clinical decision making. 19 In contrast, a +LR between 1 and 2 and a −LR between 0.5 and 1 alter disease probability by a small and less clinically significant degree. 19 The ease of application and consistency of performance of a predictive tool also determines its clinical applicability.

The Asthma Predictive Index (API) from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study 9 was the first of several published predictive tools. The API includes invasive investigations (blood eosinophil levels) and has a moderate +LR (4.9 for asthma at age 8) with a high −LR (0.9), making it a moderate prediction tool for "ruling in" school‐age asthma but not helpful in "ruling out". 14 Validation studies have expressed reservations about its ease of implementation and clinical usefulness. 14, 20, 21 Subsequently, other studies have developed predictive tools. 10, 11, 12, 22 However, these often achieve moderately high +LRs at a cost of high −LRs. 14 Some included predictors solely from clinical history to improve ease of use in clinical settings. 10, 12 However, the additions of minimally invasive objective predictors (eg, skin prick tests [SPT]) may add additional value to the predictive tool.

### Exhaled nitric oxide in symptomatic children at preschool age predicts later asthma [^115zBEXp]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prediction of asthma in young children with respiratory symptoms is hampered by the lack of objective measures applicable in clinical routine. In this prospective study in a preschool children cohort, we assessed whether the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a biomarker of airway inflammation, is associated with asthma at school age.

Methods

At baseline, IgE and eosinophils were measured in the blood, and FeNO was measured offline in 391 children aged 3–47 months with lower airway symptoms. We developed an asthma predictive index (API) including high FeNO as major criterion. At follow-up, primary outcome was physician-diagnosed asthma based on standardized interviews in those children reaching school age (n = 166).

Results

FeNO was significantly elevated in those children with later asthma (68/166) as compared to children not developing asthma. Median (IQR) FeNO was 10.5 (6.6–17.2) vs. 7.4 (5.3–10.3) ppb. Per 5 ppb FeNO increase, the odds ratio (95% CI) for asthma increased by 2.44 (1.61–3.70) without changing when adjusting for confounders. Using the new API, children scored at risk had 58.0% probability for later asthma, whereas the negative predictive value was 78.2%, which was comparable to the classical API.

Conclusions

In this cohort of high-risk preschool children, elevated FeNO is associated with increased risk for school-age asthma. The new API including FeNO identifies children at risk of later asthma comparably to the classical API, but does not require blood sampling.

### Expert artificial intelligence-based natural language processing characterises childhood asthma [^111cZszv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Important concerns in the current asthma care and research are the use of inconsistent asthma criteria, asthma ascertainment processes and sampling frame. The resultant variability in identification of asthma across the practice and research settings may cause inconsistent results of studies including genome-wide association studies, clinical trials and biomarker studies and delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice eventually deterring translation of study results into clinical practice. For example, one previous study reported that 60 different definitions of childhood asthma have been used among 122 published studies. This is in part due to: (1) the lack of consensus for asthma ascertainment, (2) inherent limitations of structured data to ascertain asthma (eg, poor sensitivity of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, 31%), (3) expensive and difficult to use suggested biomarkers for ascertaining asthma for large-scale studies and (4) labour-intensive, expensive and inconsistent manual chart review of great volumes of records to apply asthma criteria despite their availability.

Given the growing deployment of electronic health records (EHRs) systems enabling large practice-based longitudinal data mining, advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as natural language processing (NLP; expert AI) may potentially enable us to address these challenges as it can extract, process and classify free-text data from EHRs. For example, we recently developed and validated NLP algorithms for two existing retrospective criteria for childhood asthma (NLP algorithms for Predetermined Asthma Criteria (NLP-PAC) and NLP algorithms for Asthma Predictive Index (NLP-API)). The performance of individual NLP algorithm determining asthma status based on comprehensive EHRs including free text was almost close to that by humans (eg, 97% sensitivity and 95% specificity for NLP-PAC). We also demonstrated external validation of our NLP algorithms for these asthma criteria across different study settings despite different population, practice and EHRs systems. Thus, such capabilities of NLP using EHRs are poised to potentially address the current challenges in asthma research and care described above by applying the existing asthma criteria to cohorts of children in a consistent manner on a large scale.

While the two asthma criteria are complementary, it is unknown whether NLP algorithms for the two asthma criteria systematically identify childhood asthma and its subgroup with distinctive clinical characteristics. We applied the NLP algorithms to a large birth cohort in a real-word setting and systematically characterised subgroups of asthmatic children.

### A simple tool to identify infants at high risk of mild to severe childhood asthma: the persistent asthma predictive score [^116tM9Yk]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent wheezing in infants is a recognized risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. We sought to develop an easy-to-use persistent asthma predictive score (PAPS) in a population of young recurrent wheezers.

Methods

We retrospectively studied clinical and biological data of infants under 2 years of age presenting recurrent wheezing and evaluated current asthma at 6 years of age using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Multivariate analysis was performed to select predictive variables to generate a PAPS. The score was then tested on another cohort for independent validation.

Results

Two hundred infants were included in the cohort used to create the PAPS, and 227 in the validation cohort. In the first population, 47% of the children had developed asthma at 6 years of age, including 33% with mild to severe persistent asthma. Three parameters independently predicted persistent asthma: family history of asthma, personal atopic dermatitis, and multiple allergen sensitizations. Based on these variables, the PAPS showed 42% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 67% positive predictive value, and 76% negative predictive value for the prediction of persistent asthma. It was able to discriminate future persistent asthmatic from nonfuture persistent asthmatic children, with an accuracy of 74% in the initial population and 67% in the validation population.

Conclusions

The PAPS, based on three easy-to-obtain variables, could help the physician in clinical practice to identify infants at high risk for persistent childhood asthma, and thus better evaluate the need for secondary preventive measures.

### A pediatric asthma risk score to better predict asthma development in young children [^114S5FVW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma phenotypes are currently not amenable to primary prevention or early intervention because their natural history cannot be reliably predicted. Clinicians remain reliant on poorly predictive asthma outcome tools because of a lack of better alternatives.

Objective

We sought to develop a quantitative personalized tool to predict asthma development in young children.

Methods

Data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (n = 762) birth cohort were used to identify factors that predicted asthma development. The Pediatric Asthma Risk Score (PARS) was constructed by integrating demographic and clinical data. The sensitivity and specificity of PARS were compared with those of the Asthma Predictive Index (API) and replicated in the Isle of Wight birth cohort.

Results

PARS reliably predicted asthma development in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (sensitivity = 0.68, specificity = 0.77). Although both the PARS and API predicted asthma in high-risk children, the PARS had improved ability to predict asthma in children with mild-to-moderate asthma risk. In addition to parental asthma, eczema, and wheezing apart from colds, variables that predicted asthma in the PARS included early wheezing (odds ratio [OR], 2.88; 95% CI, 1.52–5.37), sensitization to 2 or more food allergens and/or aeroallergens (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.49–4.05), and African American race (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.19–3.47). The PARS was replicated in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.79), demonstrating that it is a robust, valid, and generalizable asthma predictive tool.

Conclusions

The PARS performed better than the API in children with mild-to-moderate asthma. This is significant because these children are the most common and most difficult to predict and might be the most amenable to prevention strategies.

### The asthma predictive index as a surrogate diagnostic tool in preschoolers: analysis of a longitudinal birth cohort [^111uUXPx]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma in preschool children remains an unsolved challenge, at a time when early identification would allow for better education and treatment to prevent morbidity and lung function deterioration.

Objective

To evaluate if the asthma predictive index (API) can be used as surrogate for asthma diagnosis in preschoolers.

Methods

Birth cohort of 339 pregnant women enrolled at delivery and their offspring, who were followed for atopy, wheezing, and other respiratory illnesses through 30 months of age. The API was determined at 30 months of age by the researchers; and examined its association with physician-diagnosed asthma during the first 30 months, made independently by the primary care physician not involved in the study.

Results

Among 307 offspring with complete follow-up, 44 (14.3%) were API+. Maternal body mass index, maternal education, past oral contraceptive use, birthweight, placenta weight, age of daycare at 12m, gastroesophageal reflux disease at 12m, acute otitis media at 18m, bronchiolitis, croup and pneumonia, cord blood adiponectin were all associated with API+. In the multivariable analysis, API+ was associated with almost sixfold odds of asthma diagnosis (adjusted OR = 5.7, 95% CI [2.6–12.3]), after adjusting for the relevant covariates above including respiratory infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The API sensitivity was 48%, specificity 92%, 61% PPV, 88% NPV, 6.4 LR+, 0.56 LR-, 0.84 diagnosis accuracy. The adjusted odds for asthma was 11.4.

Conclusions

This longitudinal birth cohort suggests, for first time, that API (a structured definition for asthma), could be used as a diagnostic tool, not only as a prognostic tool, in toddlers and preschoolers.

Data management and selection process

Records will be retrieved from databases and transferred into a reference manager. Records will be de-duplicated, screened, and managed using Covidence. Two reviewers (L.D. A.B.) will independently screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text copies of all potentially relevant records will be obtained. Two reviewers (L.D. A.B. or S. McL.) will independently assess whether each full-text record meets the inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies will be arbitrated by a third reviewer (H.P. S.L. or A.S.).

Data extraction

Included articles will be categorised into two groups: derivation studies and external model validation (with or without model updating). A standardised data extraction form to collect relevant data items from eligible studies will be developed and piloted in line with Cochrane and CHARMS guidance. Data extraction will be undertaken by two reviewers (L.D. S. McL.) who will independently extract relevant data from each included study onto the data extraction form. Any disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer (H.P. S.L. or A.S.).

Data items

Data from the included studies will be summarised in descriptive tables. Table 1 lists the minimum set of data items to be extracted. If a study reports more than one model, we will extract data separately for each model.

### Managing the allergy and asthma epidemic in 2020s-lessons from the Finnish experience [^116Qob4q]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.3.2 Asthma

Diagnostic criteria of asthma, particularly among young children, varied a lot in the country. The criteria in different age groups were unified and asthma guidelines updated twice during the programme. In small children below 3 years of age, wheezing episodes or symptomatic periods were evaluated by defining asthma predictive index (API). After adopting these simple recommendations, use of asthma drugs in smallest children decreased by 40% without an increase in hospitalizations or acute visits.

For children between 3–7 years of age, impulse oscillometry has been validated and combined with free field running with bronchodilatation test. Asthma drug reimbursement is entitled to a child having both clinical symptoms and variable airflow limitation shown by lung function measurements. For school‐aged children, particularly those above 12 years of age, diagnostic requirements are the same as for adults. Hospitalization or acute visits for children above 4–5 years of age are rare in Finland demonstrating the long‐term validity of the diagnostic policy. Paediatric asthma deaths are almost non‐existent in Finland.

In primary care and in low‐ and middle‐income countries, measures like the allergen component diagnostics, OIT or impulse oscillometry are not readily available or usable, but they are mentioned here to keep up interest also to specialists and allergists being in key position to promote the programme goals.

The practical measures for food allergy, wheezing and asthma are listed in Table 2.

### Development of a symptom-based tool for screening of children at high risk of preschool asthma [^112vZskk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Despite advances in asthma therapeutics, the burden remains highest in preschool children; therefore, it is critical to identify primary care tools that distinguish preschool children at high risk for burdensome disease for further evaluation. Current asthma prediction tools, such as the modified Asthma Predictive Index (mAPI), require invasive tests, limiting their applicability in primary care and low-resource settings.

Objective

To develop and evaluate the use of a symptom-based screening tool to detect children at high risk of asthma, persistent wheeze symptoms, and health care burden.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The cohort for this diagnostic study included participants from the CHILD Study (n = 2511) from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, the Raine Study from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 2012 (n = 2185), and the Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study (CAPPS) from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 1995 (n = 349), with active follow-up to date. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2019, to May 31, 2022.

Exposures

The CHILDhood Asthma Risk Tool (CHART) identified factors associated with asthma in patients at 3 years of age (timing and number of wheeze or cough episodes, use of asthma medications, and emergency department visits or hospitalizations for asthma or wheeze) to identify children with asthma or persistent symptoms at 5 years of age.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Within the CHILD Study cohort, CHART was evaluated against specialist clinician diagnosis and the mAPI. External validation was performed in both a general population cohort (Raine Study [Australia]) and a high-risk cohort (CAPPS [Canada]). Predictive accuracy was measured by sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and positive and negative predicted values.

Results

Among 2511 children (mean [SD] age at 3-year clinic visit, 3.08 [0.17] years; 1324 [52.7%] male; 1608 of 2476 [64.9%] White) with sufficient questionnaire data to apply CHART at 3 years of age, 2354 (93.7%) had available outcome data at 5 years of age. CHART applied in the CHILD Study at 3 years of age outperformed physician assessments and the mAPI in predicting persistent wheeze (AUROC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.97), asthma diagnosis (AUROC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69–0.77), and health care use (emergency department visits or hospitalization for wheeze or asthma) (AUROC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61–0.78). CHART had a similar predictive performance for persistent wheeze in the Raine Study (N = 2185) in children at 5 years of age (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79–0.86) and CAPPS (N = 349) at 7 years of age (AUROC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.94).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this diagnostic study, CHART was able to identify children at high risk of asthma at as early as 3 years of age. CHART could be easily incorporated as a routine screening tool in primary care to identify children who need monitoring, timely symptom control, and introduction of preventive therapies.

Role of lung function in assessing asthma control — Lung function does not correlate strongly with asthma symptoms in adults or children. In some asthma control tools, lung function is numerically averaged or added with symptoms, but this is not recommended because if the tool includes several symptom items, these can outweigh clinically important differences in lung function. In addition, low FEV1 is a strong independent predictor of risk of exacerbations, even after adjustment for symptom frequency.

4.3 Implications for clinical care and future research

The PARC tool has now undergone external validation in two population‐based and one clinical cohort. The tool shows good to very‐good discriminative ability in community settings and good discriminative ability in the clinical setting. However, it has a higher sensitivity of 95% and an NPV of 84% in SPAC, indicating a possible role for assisting clinicians to accurately identify children with a low risk of developing. For example, pediatric pulmonologists in Switzerland could use the PARC tool to reassure parents with children with a score of 4 or less that their child's risk of having asthma in 2 years' time is only 5%. The proportion of children in our analysis with a PARC score 4 or less was 10%. The tool could also have potential applications for triaging patients for follow‐up. Furthermore, by narrowing the definition of asthma to a more severe spectrum the tool performs better in SPAC. This suggests that, in a clinical context, the PARC tool may be able predict severe asthma better and that any adaptation of the PARC tool in the future should use different outcome definitions such as "severe asthma" or "asthma persistence". Previous applications of prediction tools to clinical settings have demonstrated a role for invasive measures such as blood eosinophils, IgE senitization, and FeNO with variable success. Future prediction model development for asthma risk in preschool children attending respiratory clinics could include these invasive measures to improve their discriminatory performance.

### Automated chart review utilizing natural language processing algorithm for asthma predictive index [^117Fe13A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

EHRs have been around since the 1960s when they were introduced as a technique to guide and teach medical professionals about how to handle medical knowledge. In the early twenty-first century, a need for standardizing national data, as transmitting health information across organizational and regional boundaries was brought forth. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 directed the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to promote the adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records. By 2014, 3 out of 4 (76%) hospitals had adopted at least a basic EHR system, and there are growing trends of applying EHR to clinical and translational research. For example, clinical studies are facilitating investigators in identifying the characteristics of patients and discovering phenotypes from EHR such as Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE). NLP algorithms have been used for automated encoding of text data into structured data, extraction of molecular pathways from articles, translation of information from chest radiographs as well as identification of medical complications in postoperative patients from EHR. Thus, given the growing worldwide deployment of EHR systems and the usefulness of free-text embedded in medical records in capturing text-based events, an NLP algorithm will be an important tool to overcome the current challenges of processing large-scale data in disease ascertainment or phenotypic characterization.

Indeed, in our previous studies, we were able to establish the application of NLP algorithms for asthma ascertainment using an existing other asthma criteria, and to our knowledge, this was the first exploration to apply NLP algorithms to asthma ascertainment as other algorithms using NLP for asthma were for identifying physician diagnosis of asthma or asthma guideline, but not for applying existing asthma criteria. This current study is an extension of our previous work by adding an NLP algorithm for API. Given the lack of gold standard to ascertain asthma status, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines suggest using API for asthma management. API has been used for prospective as well as retrospective studies. As EHRs are likely to continue to be used in clinical research described above, an NLP algorithm for API can be beneficial in the future.

### External validation of the predicting asthma risk in children tool in a clinical cohort [^114bDmXN]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Symptoms such as cough and wheeze in preschool‐aged children can be an early sign of asthma and cause a high burden of morbidity and health‐care utilization. Asthma also remains an important cause of morbidity later in childhood. To reduce childhood asthma morbidity and overtreatment, it is important for clinicians to identify children with asthma early. For this, they require tools that help distinguish preschool children who are at risk of developing asthma from those who cough or wheeze for other reasons and will possibly outgrow their symptoms.

Several asthma prediction tools have been developed to help identify preschool children at risk of developing asthma. These prediction tools vary in their target population, geography, predictors used, and applicable settings. Most use validated questions on respiratory symptoms and some include invasively measured traits such as atopy, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), lung function, and genetic markers.,

The Predicting Asthma Risk in Children (PARC) tool has the advantage that it predicts asthma risk in preschool children by using questions asked in routine clinical care and avoids the use of invasive measures that may not be available in primary care or resource‐poor settings. The tool was developed by Pescatore et al.using data of preschool children from the population‐based Leicester Respiratory Cohort (LRC) who had seen their doctor at age 1–3 years with symptoms of cough or wheeze, and aimed to predict whether they would have asthma 5 years later (Supporting Information: Table S1). The outcome of asthma was defined as wheeze and asthma medication use in the preceding 12 months. In internal validation in the LRC, the PARC tool demonstrated good discriminatory performance (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.78). In external validation in community‐based settings, the PARC tool demonstrated a good discriminatory performance in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort (AUC: 0.77)and very good discriminatory performance in the multicenter allergy study (MAS) cohort (AUC: 0.83). The PARC tool has yet to be externally validated in clinical settings where preschool children are seen for wheeze or cough. We, therefore, aimed to perform an external validation of the PARC tool in a prospective cohort of children with respiratory symptoms presenting to pediatric pulmonology outpatient clinics and assess its performance in predicting asthma 2 years later.

### Automated chart review utilizing natural language processing algorithm for asthma predictive index [^111X2reG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our study results have several implications in clinical practice, research, and public health. In clinical practice, it enables clinicians and health care systems to apply NLP-API for population management strategies. Using NLP-API, health care systems may identify children who meet API during early childhood (e.g. < 3 years old) on a regular basis for their better access to preventive and therapeutic interventions for asthma, and temporal and geographic trends of outcomes to these interventions may be assessed and monitored at a population level. The impact of a delay in diagnosis of asthma on asthma outcomes can also be examined. Allocation of resources could then be guided by this surveillance system. In research, while NLP-API addresses the limitations of the current methods of asthma ascertainment, it is an innovative approach enabling large-scale clinical studies minimizing methodological heterogeneity of asthma ascertainment due to human biases and mistakes when they review medical records, especially for a large volume of patients. There is a noteworthy finding in our error analysis to examine discrepancies of patient's API status between NLP-API and manual chart review. Independent third reviewer (an allergist) assessed the discrepancies, and we found that the NLP-API was able to capture API-positive patients that were missed by manual chart review as humans could miss or overlook asthma-related events during the review of large volumes of medical records. Thus, the NLP approach might potentially open up a venue to improve or correct human errors in processing a large volume of data or text review, and this needs to be further studied. Use of a computer based algorithm for ascertaining asthma becomes helpful in public health surveillance as it allows health care systems to monitor the trends of asthma prevalence and incidence in real-time and assess the impact of asthma on serious health outcomes (e.g. susceptibility to serious and common infections including vaccine preventable diseases).

### Usefulness of asthma predictive index in ascertaining asthma status of children using medical records: an explorative study [^115stwvm]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Frequent wheezing in original asthma predictive index (API) was defined by parental report of recurrent wheezing within 1 year during the first 3 years of life. The nature of frequent wheezing in children, particularly aged over 3 years, has not been studied. We aimed to assess the frequency and interval of wheezing to define frequent wheezing in ascertaining asthma for children using medical records.

Methods

Among children who participated in a previous study (n = 427), all wheezing episodes documented in medical records were collected for children who had ≥ 2 wheezing episodes PLUS met one major criterion or two minor criteria of API. We compared the distribution of known risk factors for asthma between subjects having two consecutive wheezing episodes with shorter interval (≤ 1 year) compared to those with longer interval (1 to 3 years).

Results

A total of 62 children met API at median age of 2.3 years. During follow-up period (median age: 11.3 years), a total of 198 wheezing episodes were observed. 81% of wheezing intervals were within 3 years from the earlier wheezing episode, including 60% within 1 year. Children who met API based on 1-year interval (n = 40) vs 1- to 3-year interval (n = 13) appeared to be similar in regard to the known risk factors for asthma.

Conclusions

Our exploratory study finding suggests that children who had frequent wheezing episodes with longer interval (< 3 years) need to be considered to be determined as asthma cases when API is applied to retrospective medical records. Prospective studies with a larger sample size need to replicate this finding.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) clinical severity index — rationale and goals: Levels of esophageal eosinophils were "not a comprehensive biomarker of severity", and clinicians face challenges including "assessing disease activity, response to therapy, risk for progression, and the thresholds at which a change in therapy is needed", creating the need for "a simple system to assess and track disease activity in a meaningful way in the clinical setting". The index aims to "focus on the critical elements of clinical severity across all domains (ie, symptoms, complications, endoscopy, and histology)" and enable categorization "as having inactive, mild, moderate, or severe disease", while also providing "a common language for communicating with patients and other providers" and "helping standardize practice for treatments and monitoring based on disease severity similar to the asthma model", acknowledging that "additional data will be required for full realization and to assess the index's reliability and reproducibility".

### Development and validation of a novel risk score for asthma exacerbations: the risk score for exacerbations [^1155MB2h]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Risk Score for asthma Exacerbation (RSE)" for asthma exacerbation and asthma.

The Risk Score for Asthma Exacerbation (RSE) is a clinical calculator used to predict the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in patients diagnosed with asthma. This scoring system is particularly useful in identifying patients who are at a higher risk of experiencing severe asthma attacks, thereby aiding clinicians in tailoring treatment plans and preventive measures to reduce the risk of exacerbations. The RSE includes factors such as patient's age, history of previous severe exacerbations, current use of oral corticosteroids, and hospitalization or emergency department visits due to asthma in the past year. It is not applicable to patients without a confirmed diagnosis of asthma.

The Risk Score for asthma Exacerbation (RSE) calculator evaluates an individual's risk of experiencing asthma exacerbation within six months by using their responses to five specific health-related criteria. Each criterion is assigned a score based on predefined risk factors, and these scores are summed to compute a total risk score. This total score is then interpreted to estimate the risk of future exacerbations.

The criteria evaluated are:

1. Body Mass Index (BMI)
2. Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 Score (ACQ-5)
3. Postbronchodilator FEV1 Percentage of Predicted Normal (% PN)
4. Reliever Use per Day
5. Global Initiative for Asthma Treatment Step

The scoring system assigns specific values to each category within these criteria:

- **BMI**:
- **≥ 30**: 14 points
- **< 30**: 0 points

- **Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 Score**:

- < 1.5: 0 points
- 1.5–2.5: 7 points
- ≥ 2.5: 13 points

- **Postbronchodilator FEV1% PN**:
- **≥ 90%**: 0 points
- **80–90%**: 13 points
- **< 80%**: 20 points

- **Reliever Use per Day**:

- **< 2**: 0 points
- **2–4**: 11 points
- **≥ 4**: 26 points

- **Global Initiative for Asthma Treatment Step**:

- **Step 3**: 0 points
- **Step 4**: 27 points

To compute the risk score, the user-provided input for each criterion is translated into its corresponding score using the above definitions. All the individual scores are then summed to produce a total risk score ranging from 0 to 100.

The interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- **Score 0–10**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 5%
- **Score 11–20**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 5–7%
- **Score 21–30**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 7–10%
- **Score 31–40**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 10–12%
- **Score 41–50**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 12–15%
- **Score 51–60**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 15–18%
- **Score 61–70**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 18–24%
- **Score 71–80**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 24–30%
- **Score 81–90**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 30–37%
- **Score 91–100**: Risk of exacerbation in 6 months is 37–45%

### Predicting asthma in preschool children with asthma symptoms: study rationale and design [^114VhcQQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In well-child care it is difficult to determine whether preschool children with asthma symptoms actually have or will develop asthma at school age. The PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) Risk Score has been proposed as an instrument that predicts asthma at school age, using eight easy obtainable parameters, assessed at the time of first asthma symptoms at preschool age. The aim of this study is to present the rationale and design of a study 1) to externally validate and update the PIAMA Risk Score, 2) to develop an Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool to predict asthma at school age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children with asthma symptoms and 3) to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care.

Methods and Design

The study will be performed within the framework of Generation R, a prospective multi-ethnic cohort study. In total, consent for postnatal follow-up was obtained from 7893 children, born between 2002 and 2006. At preschool age the PIAMA Risk Score will be assessed and used to predict asthma at school age. Discrimination (C-index) and calibration will be assessed for the external validation. We will study whether the predictive ability of the PIAMA Risk Score can be improved by removing or adding predictors (e.g. preterm birth). The (updated) PIAMA Risk Score will be converted to the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool- to predict asthma at school age in preschool children with asthma symptoms. Additionally, we will conduct a pilot study to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care.

Discussion

Application of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care will help to distinguish preschool children at high- and low-risk of developing asthma at school age when asthma symptoms appear. This study will increase knowledge about the validity of the PIAMA risk score and might improve risk assessment of developing asthma at school age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children, who present with asthma symptoms at well-child care.

### The clinical respiratory score predicts paediatric critical care disposition in children with respiratory distress presenting to the emergency department [^113HgBK1]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Such clinical scores or scales can be simple and low-cost tools to assess respiratory distress severity for the whole paediatric age span. Given the high prevalence of asthma, it is not surprising that for its assessment several scores have been reported, many of which were developed ad hoc without formal validation. A few of them, like Pulmonary Index or Pulmonary Score were only validated in preschool aged children, while others like Paediatric Asthma Score were found to be beneficial as a measure only of asthma severity among children in the ED. We were interested in testing a score based on simple measures, applicable across the paediatric age range with the ability to detect severe illness of any sort likely to require additional support. The Clinical Respiratory Score (CRS) comprises a number of predictors of respiratory distress, for example, child's colour, respiratory rate, presence of wheeze, use of accessory muscles, mental status and oxygen saturation. Since the CRS involves simple observations (Table 1), it requires minimal resources and is therefore well suited to LMIC settings. It was first introduced and tested in a high-income country setting in over 300 patients, aged 1 to 18 years, who presented to the ED with symptoms that suggested reactive airway disease / asthma. It was the further validated for acute chest syndrome presentation in sickle cell disease patients in the US. The CRS, however, has not been validated in LMICs, for respiratory distress presentations either from primary respiratory or non-respiratory illnesses. Unlike the multiple alternatives, the CRS includes parameters that might allow it to be utilised in both asthma and non-asthma related respiratory distress in the child, including, but not limited to, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, foreign body aspiration, and so on, and we sought to test its predictive value in terms of decompensation.

Table 1
The Clinical Respiratory Score (CRS) is a rapidly determined, easy to use tool that takes into account the 6 parameters shown in the table

Based on the total score obtained there can be 3 categories of respiratory distress: Mild (< 3), Moderate (4–7), Severe (8–12). (References)

We hypothesised that the CRS may also potentially help in patient stabilization and prompt disposition in the ED.

3 EVALUATING THE PROGRESSION OF CHILDHOOD ASTHMA

In one study of the progression into adulthood for individuals with moderate to severe childhood asthma, 15% experienced remission and 22% had intermittent asthma. 12 The remaining subjects had persistent asthma, including 14% with mild, 29% with moderate, and 19% with severe asthma. 12 Objective factors predicting remission included lower childhood total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), fewer positive allergy skin tests, and milder childhood asthma. 12 Remission during adolescence occurs more commonly in males than in females and may account for the greater incidence of asthma in females starting at this age. 15, 16 In addition, fluctuations in estrogen during women's menstrual cycles have been linked to worsening asthma symptoms (perimenstrual asthma). 17 In one study, female patients with asthma who used an oral contraceptive (which stabilizes hormone levels throughout a cycle) had reduced asthma symptoms, improved pulmonary function, and improved asthma control compared with those not taking an oral contraceptive. 17

The Asthma Predictive Index (API) was developed from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study to help predict which pediatric patients will experience asthma into adulthood and which patients will not develop asthma based on a combination of major and minor criteria for children with frequent wheezing episodes. 18 For a positive API score, major criteria include any one of the following: the presence of physician‐diagnosed parental asthma or child eczema; minor criteria include any two of the following: the presence of physician‐diagnosed allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, or elevated blood eosinophils ≥ 4%. Table 1 shows the criteria for assessing a patient's asthma risk using the API based on the onset of wheezing episodes and the number of criteria and which criteria are met. 18 Additional studies have validated the accuracy of the API and offered further guidelines on the number of each type of criterion necessary to predict asthma development in later childhood, including additional criteria such as the presence of allergen sensitivities (the modified API). 15

Airway inflammation markers — Many inflammatory correlates can be evaluated and studied serially in respiratory and other body fluids, such as nasal smears or lavage, induced sputum, or BAL, which may define specific phenotypes or in some cases predict severity. Exhaled nitric oxide is a noninvasive measure of airway inflammation and is useful for monitoring objective responses to globally administered corticosteroids. Although breath condensate analysis is an evolving noninvasive method for evaluation of asthma, results are still variable and further refinements are required before it can be accepted as a valid diagnostic method.

### Assessment of cumulative health risk in the world trade center general responder cohort [^113cqaht]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple comorbidities have been reported among rescue/recovery workers responding to the 9/11/2001 WTC disaster. In this study, we developed an index that quantifies the cumulative physiological burden of comorbidities and predicts life expectancy in this cohort.

Methods

A machine learning approach (gradient boosting) was used to model the relationship between mortality and several clinical parameters (laboratory test results, blood pressure, pulmonary function measures). This model was used to construct a risk index, which was validated by assessing its association with a number of health outcomes within the WTC general responder cohort.

Results

The risk index showed significant associations with mortality, self-assessed physical health, and onset of multiple chronic conditions, particularly COPD, hypertension, asthma, and sleep apnea.

Conclusion

As an aggregate of several clinical parameters, this index serves as a cumulative measure of physiological dysregulation and could be utilized as a prognostic indicator of life expectancy and morbidity risk.

FENO measurement in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — prediction of future asthma: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FENO measurement to predict the future development of asthma (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The Clinician's Summary states that in children aged 4 years and younger with recurrent wheezing, FENO measurement does not reliably predict the future development of asthma, and test results should be interpreted with caution until more data are available; the Expert Panel recommends against using FENO testing to predict future development of asthma in this age group until additional research and clinical practice determinations are available. Evidence synthesis identified ten studies in children younger than 5 years to predict subsequent asthma in those aged 5 years and older; none were RCTs, seven were nonrandomized longitudinal studies and three were cross-sectional; in only a single study, a FENO level indicating increased risk yielded a positive predictive value of 58.0% for a composite of wheezing, diagnosis of asthma, or use of an ICS at age 7 years, with a negative predictive value of 78.2%. Additional context notes that FENO can be measured in young children with normal resting breathing and reference values exist for ages 1 to 5 years; in some preschool children with recurrent coughing and wheezing, an elevated FENO level more than 4 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection may help predict physician-diagnosed asthma at school age, but the studies reviewed had conflicting results and provided low to moderate certainty; the acceptability of FENO measurement for predictive purposes is low and use of this testing is unlikely to change current treatment standards and could actually misdirect care.

### Validation of the asthma predictive index and comparison with simpler clinical prediction rules [^112PgiMZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The loose and stringent Asthma Predictive Indices (API), developed in Tucson, are popular rules to predict asthma in preschool children. To be clinically useful, they require validation in different settings.

Objective

To assess the predictive performance of the API in an independent population and compare it with simpler rules based only on preschool wheeze.

Methods

We studied 1954 children of the population-based Leicester Respiratory Cohort, followed up from age 1 to 10 years. The API and frequency of wheeze were assessed at age 3 years, and we determined their association with asthma at ages 7 and 10 years by using logistic regression. We computed test characteristics and measures of predictive performance to validate the API and compare it with simpler rules.

Results

The ability of the API to predict asthma in Leicester was comparable to Tucson: for the loose API, odds ratios for asthma at age 7 years were 5.2 in Leicester (5.5 in Tucson), and positive predictive values were 26% (26%). For the stringent API, these values were 8.2 (9.8) and 40% (48%). For the simpler rule early wheeze, corresponding values were 5.4 and 21%; for early frequent wheeze, 6.7 and 36%. The discriminative ability of all prediction rules was moderate (c statistic ≤ 0.7) and overall predictive performance low (scaled Brier score < 20%).

Conclusion

Predictive performance of the API in Leicester, although comparable to the original study, was modest and similar to prediction based only on preschool wheeze. This highlights the need for better prediction rules.
