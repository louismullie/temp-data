## Question

What is the best treatment for uriinary tract infections in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for urinary tract infections in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the UTI phenotype and severity because treatment hinges on whether this is cystitis, febrile/pyelonephritis, or complicated disease. Then, I should verify the optimal route of therapy and whether oral therapy is acceptable. Next, I will examine antibiotic selection and stewardship, including local resistance patterns. After that, I need to determine duration of therapy and reconcile conflicting evidence. Finally, I should consider special populations, imaging and follow-up, and prevention strategies, and close with a concise, practical recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because treatment differs materially by syndrome. Uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis) is typically afebrile or minimally febrile with localized bladder symptoms, febrile UTI in children often reflects pyelonephritis and carries risk of renal scarring, and complicated UTI includes anatomical or functional abnormalities, severe illness, immunocompromise, or atypical pathogens, which mandates broader evaluation and often broader therapy [^dd003432] [^03e88d61].

> I need to check the route of therapy next. For most children who are clinically stable, oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy, and this equivalence has been demonstrated in RCTs and affirmed by guidelines, so I should not default to IV unless there is sepsis, inability to tolerate oral therapy, or a need for rapid high bioavailability in severe disease [^996fc75a] [^3acd3848] [^723dca33].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration before I verify the evidence base. Historically, febrile UTI has been treated for 7–14 days, and the AAP still recommends 7–14 days for febrile UTI in 2–24 month olds, but newer comparative effectiveness data suggest shorter courses may be noninferior in selected children, and a recent randomized trial supports 5 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate as noninferior to 10 days for noncomplicated febrile UTI, so I should individualize duration based on severity, response, and risk factors rather than insist on 10 days for all [^aa79cd55] [^9f3b9489] [^7a4a0118].

> Wait, let me verify the lower UTI duration question because guidelines conflict. NICE and some European guidance allow 3 days for cystitis in children older than 3 months, whereas AAP guidance has historically favored 7–10 days even for cystitis; given this heterogeneity and the modest absolute differences, a pragmatic approach is 3–5 days for clearly uncomplicated cystitis in older infants and children, with longer courses if symptoms persist or risk factors emerge [^dd003432] [^aa79cd55].

> I should confirm antibiotic selection principles and stewardship. Empiric therapy should be guided by local antibiograms, with narrow-spectrum agents preferred; globally, resistance to amoxicillin and TMP-SMX is high, so first-line oral options often include cefalexin, nitrofurantoin (for lower UTI only), or amoxicillin-clavulanate, while parenteral options for severe disease include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime; once culture returns, I must de-escalate to the narrowest effective agent to limit resistance [^60df4b65] [^723dca33] [^c935e053].

> But wait, what if the child has a complicated UTI. In that case, I need to ensure broader initial coverage and longer duration, often 10–14 days total, with initial IV therapy for sepsis, high-grade VUR, or neonates, and then step down to oral therapy when clinically improved; I should also anticipate resistant organisms such as ESBLs in recurrent UTI or prior broad-spectrum exposure and tailor empiric choices accordingly, avoiding routine carbapenems unless risk is high [^03e88d61] [^e8c912dd] [^9f7deb4f].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. For infants under 3 months, I should maintain a low threshold for hospitalization, parenteral therapy, and septic evaluation, given the risk of urosepsis and the lack of pediatric-specific duration data in this group; for immunocompromised hosts or those with urinary tract abnormalities, I should broaden empiric coverage and extend duration while planning for imaging and urology input as indicated [^723dca33] [^03e88d61].

> Next, I should review imaging and follow-up because treatment quality extends beyond antibiotics. After a first febrile UTI, renal and bladder ultrasound is reasonable to screen for anomalies, but routine VCUG is no longer recommended after a first UTI unless ultrasound is abnormal or infections recur; I need to ensure timely reassessment at 48–72 hours to confirm diagnosis, clinical response, and culture-directed narrowing, and I should instruct caregivers to seek prompt evaluation for future fevers to catch recurrences early [^29fbf5df] [^d49b6f40] [^d869b67c].

> I will now examine prevention of recurrence, since this influences both acute and longitudinal management. For children with recurrent UTIs, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis has a modest benefit at best and increases resistance risk, so I should reserve prophylaxis for carefully selected subgroups such as high-grade VUR or frequent breakthrough infections, reassessing every 6 months; concurrently, I must address bladder and bowel dysfunction, constipation, and behavioral contributors because these modifiable factors materially reduce recurrence risk [^81acdbfa] [^e8c912dd] [^b32ce50c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought single-dose therapy might be acceptable for cystitis based on adult data, but I should double-check pediatric evidence. Single-dose regimens show higher failure rates in children and are not recommended; similarly, while some meta-analyses suggested 2–4 days might match 7–14 days for lower UTI, more recent pediatric RCTs and guidelines lean toward 3–5 days for cystitis and 7–10 days for febrile UTI, with individualized shorter courses only in select, clinically improving children [^9509caf3] [^7a4a0118] [^dd003432].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned approach. For uncomplicated cystitis in children older than 3 months, treat for 3–5 days with a narrow-spectrum oral agent such as cefalexin or nitrofurantoin, ensuring no concern for upper tract involvement; for febrile UTI or suspected pyelonephritis, treat for 7–10 days, using oral therapy if stable and IV ceftriaxone if severe or unable to take oral medication, with step-down to oral therapy and culture-guided narrowing; for complicated UTI, extend to 10–14 days, start IV if indicated by severity or age, and tailor to local resistance and prior cultures; throughout, reassess at 48–72 hours, obtain appropriate imaging selectively, and implement bladder/bowel optimization to prevent recurrence [^dd003432] [^aa79cd55] [^03e88d61].

---

The best treatment for pediatric UTI is **prompt, culture-directed antibiotics** [^723dca33] with **duration tailored to illness severity** [^dd003432]: 3–5 days for cystitis [^dd003432], 7–10 days for febrile UTI/pyelonephritis [^92ad9eee], and 10–14 days for complicated disease [^03e88d61]. Oral therapy is **first-line** [^996fc75a] if the child is stable, with IV reserved for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral medication [^723dca33]. Empiric choices should reflect local resistance patterns [^60df4b65], with narrow-spectrum agents preferred once sensitivities return [^c935e053]. Routine imaging is not required after a first febrile UTI [^15a8f0c0], but ultrasound is reasonable if abnormalities are suspected [^notfound]. Prophylaxis is reserved for select high-risk cases (e.g. high-grade VUR) [^e8c912dd] and should be reassessed regularly [^e8c912dd].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard; obtain before antibiotics when possible [^27a3e613] [^42244369].
- **Specimen collection**: Catheterization or suprapubic aspiration in infants; midstream clean-catch in toilet-trained children [^27a3e613].
- **Rapid tests**: Dipstick for leukocytes/nitrites guides initial management but does not replace culture [^1bcc970e].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** [^60df4b65] and **patient factors** (age, severity, allergies) [^9f7deb4f]. Common choices include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | First-line oral agent | Covers most uropathogens; avoid if prior hypersensitivity |
| Cephalexin | First-line oral agent | Narrow-spectrum; good safety profile |
| Cefixime | Oral alternative | Useful for resistant organisms |
| Ceftriaxone | IV for severe illness | Once-daily dosing; broad coverage |
| Gentamicin | IV for severe illness | Monitor levels; avoid in renal impairment |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Duration should be **individualized** by severity and clinical response:

- **Cystitis**: 3–5 days [^dd003432]; shorter courses are effective and reduce resistance [^notfound].
- **Febrile UTI/pyelonephritis**: 7–10 days [^92ad9eee]; shorter courses (5–7 days) may suffice in select cases [^9f3b9489] [^7a4a0118].
- **Complicated UTI**: 10–14 days [^03e88d61]; longer if response is slow or resistance is present [^fce7a0e7].

---

## Route of administration

Oral therapy is **first-line** for stable children [^996fc75a]; IV therapy is reserved for severe illness, vomiting, or inability to tolerate oral medication [^723dca33]. Oral and IV regimens have similar efficacy in febrile UTI [^3acd3848].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Reassess at **48–72 hours** to confirm clinical response and culture results; adjust therapy accordingly [^d49b6f40]. Routine imaging is not required after a first febrile UTI [^15a8f0c0]; consider renal/bladder ultrasound if abnormalities are suspected or infections recur [^29fbf5df].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

- **Bladder/bowel dysfunction**: Address constipation and dysfunctional elimination [^b32ce50c].
- **Prophylaxis**: Reserve for high-risk cases (e.g. high-grade VUR) [^e8c912dd]; reassess every 6 months [^e8c912dd].
- **Cranberry**: May reduce recurrence in some children, but evidence is limited [^c5efb76a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants < 3 months**: Often require hospitalization and IV antibiotics due to risk of sepsis [^723dca33].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Rising globally; tailor empiric therapy to local resistance patterns [^60df4b65].
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare serious reactions [^notfound].

---

The best treatment for pediatric UTI is **prompt, culture-directed antibiotics** [^723dca33] with duration tailored to severity, oral therapy when stable, and judicious use of imaging and prophylaxis. This approach balances efficacy, safety, and stewardship [^c935e053].

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^9509caf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^00006251]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^cab34b09]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection in the pediatric population can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly and appropriately. All first infections may signify possible underlying anatomic or functional abnormality and require imaging of the lower and upper tracts. Accurate diagnosis of UTIs requires a properly collected quantitative urine culture. Treatment should be tailored to the pathogen as dictated by the urine culture sensitivities to minimize the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Prophylactic agents should differ from the antibiotic used in the acute setting and preferably concentrated in the urinary tract, with minimal effects on the normal fecal flora. In the long term, patients with documented evidence of renal scarring should be followed up for signs of renal deterioration and hypertension.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^38413887]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Urinary tract infections in children: treatment [^a9471dc2]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Infections vary in scope and severity, warranting thoughtful consideration of appropriate therapy. Infections of the genitourinary system may include bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic microorganisms. Adequate therapy requires rapid detection and control of these conditions to prevent pyelonephritic renal scarring and its sequelae.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^fce7a0e7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods:

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results:

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions:

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^efae707b]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Different imaging strategies in febrile urinary tract infection in childhood. what, when, why? [^cf994d21]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^706816bb]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^6367ad96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^d389c060]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^21a07948]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Design

This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis.

Participants

Five trials involving 463 children were performed.

Results

Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P < .01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).

Conclusions

Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^bf095ea7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infections are common. These infections have been recognized as a source of acute morbidity and long-term medical consequences in adulthood. There are various risk factors and clinical presentations in children with urinary tract infections. The main objectives in management include prompt diagnosis, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, identification of anatomic anomalies, and, in select patients, long-term follow-up.

### Urinary tract infection antibiotic trial design: a systematic review [^1701f7c0]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent common bacterial infections in children. No guidance on the conduct of pediatric febrile UTI clinical trials (CTs) exist.

Objective

To assess the criteria used for patient selection and the efficacy end points in febrile pediatric UTI CTs.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016.

Study Selection

We combined Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text terms for "urinary tract infections" and "therapeutics" and "clinical trials" in children (0–18 years), identifying 3086 articles.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

We included 40 CTs in which a total of 4381 cases of pediatric UTIs were investigated. Positive urine culture results and fever were the most common inclusion criteria (93% and 78%, respectively). Urine sampling method, pyuria, and colony thresholds were highly variable. Clinical and microbiological end points were assessed in 88% and 93% of the studies, respectively. Timing for end point assessment was highly variable, and only 3 studies (17%) out of the 18 performed after the Food and Drug Administration 1998 guidance publication assessed primary and secondary end points consistently with this guidance.

Limitations

Our limitations included a mixed population of healthy children and children with an underlying condition. In 6 trials, researchers studied a subgroup of patients with afebrile UTI.

Conclusions

We observed a wide variability in the microbiological inclusion criteria and the timing for end point assessment. The available guidance for adults appear not to be used by pediatricians and do not seem applicable to the childhood UTI. A harmonized design for pediatric UTIs CT is necessary.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections: the role of fluoroquinolones [^32796797]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract (UTI) occur commonly in the pediatric population. Because of the high association of pediatric UTI with congenital structural anomalies of the urinary tract and with dysfunctional elimination syndromes, it is far more common for children to be categorized as having complicated UTI than their adult counterparts. And for children more intensive therapy is often required. Early and effective treatment of UTIs in the pediatric patient is considered essential to prevent long term morbidity and potential mortality from end stage renal disease. An oral antimicrobial is more convenient than parenteral therapy and is preferable as long as clinical efficacy and safety can be assured. Oral fluoroquinolones are an attractive alternative for the treatment of complicated UTI in children, and safety must always be a factor in considering their use in this population. Although the role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric UTI is still under investigation, the limited data available demonstrate a likelihood of efficacy and safety.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^2269f9fc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### New developments in the diagnosis and management of pediatric UTIs [^effbc2ff]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are common and a major source of morbidity. The incidence of UTIs in childhood is not precisely known because it is not a reportable disease, and in many cases, especially in infants, UTIs are underdiagnosed. Furthermore, the definitions and criteria for diagnosis vary considerably. This article reviews the diagnosis and work-up of UTIs in children, and presents current data reviewing the roles of radiologic imaging, surgical correction, and antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of pediatric UTIs.

### Short-course therapy for urinary tract infections in children: the SCOUT randomized clinical trial [^84cfd348]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of pediatric-specific comparative data to guide duration of therapy recommendations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

Trial Registration

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^68341ed2]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) algorithm — initial evaluation in febrile infants 2–24 months begins with "Infant 2–24 mo with fever ≥ 38°C" and asks whether the patient requires immediate antimicrobial therapy; if immediate therapy is needed, the algorithm directs to "Obtain urine by catheterization or SPA", "Perform urinalysis", and "Culture urine obtained by catheterization or SPA", and the notes state that "A urine sample suitable for culture should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials". Initial management is to "Treat with antimicrobials effective against common uropathogens according to local sensitivity patterns; oral or parenteral", and if "Urinalysis and culture positive?" is not satisfied, "Discontinue antimicrobials".

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^3acd3848]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infections [^329c6996]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common bacterial infection in children and is considered a public health threat given the mounting rates of antibiotic-resistance among uropathogens. This article highlights recent encouraging developments in UTI research. Further work is necessary to translate the discoveries into accessible, cost-effective technologies that will aid clinicians in real-time decision-making.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

Symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children are nonspecific and urine sampling is challenging. A safe and rapid diagnosis of UTI can be achieved with new biomarkers and culture of clean-catch urine, reserving catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for severely ill infants. Most guidelines recommend ultrasound assessment and use of risk factors to direct further management of children at risk of kidney deterioration. The increasing knowledge of the innate immune system will add new predictors and treatment strategies to the management of UTI in children. Long-term outcome is good for the majority, but individuals with severe scarring can develop hypertension and decline in kidney function.

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^7769d547]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^9f3b9489]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that children receiving a short course (median 8 days) vs a prolonged course (median 11 days) of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pyelonephritis experience similar clinical outcomes. Although results did not achieve statistical significance, children who received a short course of antibiotic therapy may be less likely to have subsequent infections within the following 30 days with a more resistant strain of the same uropathogen (40% vs 64%). This finding adds to the growing body of evidence supporting shorter durations of therapy than traditionally prescribed for the treatment of common bacterial infections.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative effectiveness research study evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for pyelonephritis in children. Our data provide evidence that may help guide treatment recommendations for a common pediatric infection, particularly when combined with the high-quality randomized clinical trial data supporting shorter (5–7 days) durations of therapy for adults with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, our study included populations frequently excluded from traditional comparative effectiveness UTI studies, including those with immunocompromised systems, structural urologic abnormalities, and previous UTIs, increasing the generalizability of our findings to the pediatric population at highest risk for the development of pyelonephritis.

We found that children aged 4 to 13 years had a significantly higher odds of treatment failure (regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed) than children aged less than 4 years or greater than 14 years. We hypothesize that this finding was likely due to differences in risk factors in the aged 4 to 13 years group compared with younger and older children. A possible explanation for the development of UTIs in healthy children less than aged 4 years is evolving elimination and hygiene practices during infancy and toilet training periods; whereas children older than 14 years are more likely to experience UTIs related to sexual activity. Children between these ages, however, are less likely to develop UTIs unless there are anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, neurological abnormalities, or functional bowel control conditions. The presence of underlying urologic abnormalities was independently associated with treatment failure, regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^a0a5a82c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Short versus standard duration oral antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infection in children [^ddb8311d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has not been determined. A number of studies have compared single dose therapy to standard therapy for UTI, with mixed results. A course of antibiotics longer than a single dose but shorter than the usual 7–10 days might decrease the relapse rate and still provide some of the benefits of a shortened course of antibiotics.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of short-course (2–4 days) compared to standard duration (7–14 days) oral antibiotic treatment for acute UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002) MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002) and EMBASE (1988 -September 2002) without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing short-term (2–4 days) with standard (7–14 days) oral antibiotic therapy were selected if they studied children aged three months to 18 years with culture proven UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Ten trials were identified in which 652 children with lower tract UTI were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration oral antibiotic therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–10 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at one to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Reviewer's Conclusions

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^3de602e7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7·5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5·3 days [IQR 4·8 to 6·5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10·0 days [10·0 to 10·0]). Median age was 1·5 years (IQR 0·7 to 5·4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5·3 percentage points, one-sided 97·5% CI -∞ to 11·1, p non_inferiority = 0·24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6·0 (IQR 5·3 to 7·5) in the individualised group and 10·0 (10·0 to 10·0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4·0 days [97·5% CI -4·5 to -3·7], p < 0·0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6·8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11·1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0·61 [95% CI 0·47 to 0·80], p = 0·0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0·9 percentage points [95% CI -4·6 to 6·5], p = 0·79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5·3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1ec80859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1bcc970e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

### Update of the EAU / ESPU guidelines on urinary tract infections in children [^5e41b2a9]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and require appropriate diagnostic evaluation, management and follow-up.

Objective

To provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on Pediatric Urology, which were first published in 2015 in European Urology.

Study Design

A structured literature review was performed of new publications between 2015 and 2020 for UTIs in children. The guideline was updated accordingly with relevant new literature.

Results

The occurrence of a UTI can be the first indication of anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract, especially in patients with a febrile UTI. The basic diagnostic evaluation should include sufficient investigations to exclude urinary tract abnormalities, but should also be as minimally invasive as possible. In recent years, more risk factors have been identified to predict the presence of these anatomical anomalies, such as a non-E. Coli infection, high grade fever and ultrasound abnormalities. When these risk factors are factored into the diagnostic work-up, some invasive investigations can be omitted in a larger group of children. In addition to the treatment of active UTIs, it is also essential to prevent recurrent UTIs and consequent renal scarring. With the increase of antimicrobial resistance good antibiotic stewardship is needed. In addition, alternative preventative measures such as dietary supplements, bladder and bowel management and antibiotic prophylaxis could decrease the incidence of recurrent UTI.

Conclusion

This paper is a summary of the updated 2021 EAU guidelines on Pediatric Urology. It provides practical considerations and flowcharts for the management and diagnostic evaluation of UTIs in children.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

### Short-course versus conventional length antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in children: a meta-analysis of 1279 patients [^1c1f19b5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to compare the efficacies of single-dose, short-course (4 days or less), and standard course (5 days or greater) antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated childhood cystitis.

Methods

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing 4 days or less of therapy (short courses) with 5 days or more of therapy (conventional therapy) were included if all of the subjects were < 18 years of age, the initial infection was documented by urine culture, at least 1 subsequent culture was obtained between 3 and 30 days of enrollment, and some attempt was made to separate upper tract from lower tract infection. Composite differences among treatment groups were compared with a fixed or random effects model, depending on the test for heterogeneity.

Results

Of the 517 citations identified by literature search, 37 were selected for detailed review, and 22 were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall difference in cure rates between short and conventional courses of therapy was significant (6.38%; 95% CI: 1.88% to 10.89%), favoring the conventional course. Similar results were obtained when only studies comparing the same agents in the short and conventional courses were included (7.92%; 95% CI: 2.09% to 13.8%). Short-course amoxicillin was inferior to conventional length course (difference in cure rate, 13%; 95% CI: 4% to 24%); no difference was found between short-course and conventional length courses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (difference in cure rate, 6.24%; 95% CI = -3.74% to 16.2%).

Conclusions

We conclude that single-dose amoxicillin is inadequate therapy for uncomplicated cystitis of childhood. Three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy appears to be as effective as conventional length courses of the drug.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^e2ccd085]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in childrenand the leading cause of bacterial infections in infants, yet the population incidence for all children is still largely unknown. Urinary tract infections are typically treated with antibiotics and may lead to hospitalization, genitourinary imaging, follow-up visits, and surgical intervention. Controversy remains surrounding the optimal UTI diagnostic criteria, the need for prompt diagnosis, and the role of imaging and prophylactic antibiotic therapy.,

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial decreases in health care use and viral respiratory infection transmission from social distancing measures. These shifts offer a natural experiment to gain insight into testing, treatment, and outcomes for UTI. For a nontransmissible infection such as UTI, decreased diagnosis during the pandemic would likely be primarily associated with decreased pursuit of medical care and/or a reduction in the evaluation of fever as a result of the near disappearance of most circulating viruses. Fewer UTI diagnoses during the pandemic in the face of unchanged severe outcomes may suggest that overdiagnosis and/or overtreatment were previously occurring.

While many investigations have described changes in patterns of medical care use and trends in common childhood diagnoses during the pandemic, studies have not looked specifically at the incidence of UTI diagnoses in both ambulatory and inpatient settings across community and children's hospitals. The aims of this study were to provide estimates of population-level UTI incidence and assess changes in UTI diagnoses and measures of UTI severity, such as hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^a301ace9]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Treating urinary tract infections in young children… [^9a2f4766]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Young children with acute urinary tract infections typically are hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Effective oral therapy would eliminate the costs, risks and trauma associated with hospitalization. Hoberman and colleagues compared the effectiveness of an oral antibiotic with that of an intravenous antibiotic in treating UTIs in this population. Exclusion criteria included a history of UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, underlying chronic disease or gram-positive cocci in the urine. Patients who met the study criteria were randomized by age and duration of fever to receive cefotaxime intravenously in the hospital or cefixime on an outpatient basis. Hospitalized patients were switched to oral cefixime on day 4 or after they were afebrile for 24 hours, whichever was longer.

Follow-up examination and repeat urine culture were performed in the hospital after 24 hours. Subsequent evaluation was done by telephone after 48 hours and again after 10 days. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate found in the urine cultures. Almost one half of the isolated microorganisms were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Patients found to have bacteremia tended to be younger and to have a longer duration of fever than those without bacteremia. The incidence of reinfection did not differ significantly between groups. All follow-up renal scans were normal in children whose baseline scans were normal. In addition, the cost of inpatient treatment was twice as high as that for outpatient treatment. The authors conclude that oral cefixime is as safe and effective as intravenous cefotaxime in treating UTI in young febrile children. Outpatient management not only reduces health care costs, it is less traumatic for the patient and family.

Oral cefixime is a viable alternative because it is not associated with poor outcomes or long-term sequelae as was once thought to occur with what was perceived to be less aggressive treatment. editor's note: In an accompanying editorial, Fisher applauds the findings of the Hoberman study. She also cautions that cefixime, although appropriate for empiric therapy of UTI, has a spectrum that is too broad once susceptibility studies are available. At that point, patients should be switched to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. — g. b. h.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^bede43db]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that short courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged courses for children with pyelonephritis. Given the high incidence of UTIs in children and the increasing concern for antibiotic resistance and other negative sequelae associated with antibiotic overuse, a shorter duration of therapy for pyelonephritis could have implications for public health.

### European Association of Urology-European society of paediatric urology guidelines on paediatric urology: summary of 2024 updates. part II [^b02495dc]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

We present a summary of part II of the 2024 update of the European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society of Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines on paediatric urology. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of a number of urological conditions in the paediatric population. The aim is to provide practical recommendations for clinical management of these conditions with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

Methods

For the guidelines update, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations in the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with the conditions outlines. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and the importance of shared decision-making with patients and their guardians/caregivers. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of undescended testes, testicular tumours in prepubertal boys, acute scrotum, hypospadias, congenital penile curvature, urinary tract infections, daytime lower urinary tract conditions, urachal remnants, and transitional urology.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

Part II of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of a number of paediatric urological conditions, with recommendations designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

### Cranberry products for the prophylaxis of urinary tract infections in pediatric patients [^c5efb76a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the existing data regarding the use of cranberry products for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A literature search of Medline databases from 1966 to June 2015 was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The databases were searched using the terms "pediatrics", "children", "cranberry", "cranberry juice", and "urinary tract infections". The identified trials were then searched for additional references applicable to this topic.

Data Synthesis

A total of 8 clinical trials were identified that examined the use of cranberry products, mostly juice, for the prevention of UTIs in children. Three trials examined the use in otherwise healthy children. Five trials examined the use in pediatric patients with underlying urogenital abnormalities of which 2 compared cranberry to antibiotics. In healthy pediatric patients, cranberry use was associated with a reduction in the overall number of UTIs and a decrease in the number of antibiotic days per year for UTI treatment. In patients with urogenital abnormalities, results were conflicting, with some studies showing no reduction in UTIs compared with placebo, but others demonstrating a significant reduction. However, cranberry products had similar efficacy when compared with both cefaclor and trimethoprim. All studies used a wide variety of doses and frequencies of cranberry, making specific product recommendations difficult.

Conclusions

Cranberry appears effective for the prevention of UTIs in otherwise healthy children and is at least as effective as antibiotics in children with underlying urogenital abnormalities. However, recommendations for cranberry dosing and frequency cannot be confidently made at this time. Larger, well-designed trials are recommended.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^dd003432]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are among the most common bacterial infections in childhood. They are equally common in boys and girls during the first year of life and become more common in girls after the first year of life. Dividing UTIs into three categories; febrile upper UTI (acute pyelonephritis), lower UTI (cystitis), and asymptomatic bacteriuria, is useful for numerous reasons, mainly because it helps to understand the pathophysiology of the infection. A single episode of febrile UTI is often caused by a virulent Escherichia coli strain, whereas recurrent infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria commonly result from urinary tract malformations or bladder disturbances. Treatment of an upper UTI needs to be broad and last for 10 days, a lower UTI only needs to be treated for 3 days, often with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, and asymptomatic bacteriuria is best left untreated. Investigations of atypical and recurrent episodes of febrile UTI should focus on urinary tract abnormalities, whereas in cases of cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria the focus should be on bladder function.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^9f7deb4f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^6031a15d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^647e4593]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Gaps and inconsistencies in published information about optimal antibiotic treatment duration for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in pediatric patients pose a dilemma for antibiotic stewardship. Objective: Evaluate the association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence rates in children with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 2 to 17 years with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis and without renal/anatomical abnormality was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Database for 2013–2015. Results: Of 7698 patients, 85.5% had cystitis, 14.3% pyelonephritis. Duration of antibiotic treatment was as follows: 3 to 5 days for cystitis (20.4%) or 7 (33.6%), 10 (44.2%), or 14 (1.8%) days for any UTI. Recurrence occurred in 5.5% of patients. Covariates associated with increased recurrence risk included pretreatment antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.06–1.57), pyelonephritis on diagnosis date (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.03–2.00), follow-up visit during antibiotic treatment (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.20–4.68), parenteral antibiotic (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.33–2.69), and interaction of pyelonephritis diagnosis with nitrofurantoin monotherapy (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.20–11.29). After adjustment for covariates, the association between duration of antibiotic treatment and recurrence was not significant (compared with 7 days: 10 days: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85–1.33; 14 days: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45–1.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Antibiotic treatment duration was not significantly associated with recurrence of uncomplicated UTI in a national pediatric cohort. Results provide support for shorter-course treatment, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Changes in urinary tract infection hospitalizations post 2011 revised American academy pediatrics guidelines [^5046e6b1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple randomized trials over the past 2 decades have supported oral antimicrobial treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 revised American Academy Pediatrics guidelines on the management of UTI provide further support for outpatient management. It is unknown whether practice patterns have changed as a result of these developments.

Objective

To examine temporal trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012 as measured by the Kids' Inpatient Database.

Design and Methods

The Kid's Inpatient Database was used to analyze trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012. This triennial database is publicly available through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Hospitalization volume for clinical classification software principal diagnosis category 159 Urinary tract infection was examined for trends across years by age. Changes in length of stay and charges corrected for inflation were also examined.

Results

There were significantly fewer weighted UTI hospitalizations in 2012 compared with 1997 to 2009 (48 102 SE ± 1494 in 2009 vs 41 177 SE ± 1467 in 2012, P < .0001). The largest decrease was in 15- to 17-year-old (19.2%) and < 1-year-old (18.6%) groups. The length of stay trended down consistently, but charges have increased despite correcting for consumer price index.

Conclusions

Year 2012 represents the first significant decrease in national hospitalization rates for UTI since 1997, a trend that may be explained by the accumulating evidence supporting outpatient management in addition to recommendations from the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics UTI guidelines.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^7a4a0118]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Empiric use of cefepime in the treatment of serious urinary tract infections in children [^1fb80c4b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in childhood. They represent a significant proportion (10%) of hospital-acquired infections in children. Bacteria causing UTIs in children vary, depending on the setting (community-acquired vs. nosocomial), underlying anatomic anomalies and concurrent medical conditions.

Objective

To review published and unpublished clinical studies that have used cefepime for the treatment of UTIs in children.

Methods and Results

In two recent multicenter, randomized trials, cefepime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h and every 12 h) was compared with ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h) for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in children less than 12 years of age. In these studies a favorable clinical and microbiologic response was observed in > 95% of cefepime-treated and ceftazidime-treated children assessed at the end of treatment.

Conclusions

These results indicate that cefepime represents an important therapeutic option for the treatment of serious UTIs in children.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^0e808fc1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis – Efficacy in Pediatric Patients

NOTE: Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse events compared to controls, including events related to joints and/or surrounding tissues.

Ciprofloxacin, administered I.V. and/or orally, was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety.

Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC). The Per Protocol population had a causative organism(s) with protocol specified colony count(s) at baseline, no protocol violation, and no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up (among other criteria).

The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown below.

* Patients with baseline pathogen(s) eradicated and no new infections or superinfections/total number of patients. There were 5.5% (6/211) ciprofloxacin and 9.5% (22/231) comparator patients with superinfections or new infections.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^92699454]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to amoxicillin and TMP-SMX in some parts of the United States. The optimal duration of therapy is normally seven days, although shorter courses and single-dose regimens have demonstrated moderate but variable success. More than 60 percent of young febrile patients with UTI have evidence of pyelonephritis. Febrile infants with UTI who are younger than one year of age generally require hospitalization and initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics until afebrile, followed by oral therapy for 10 to 14 days. Appropriate intravenous agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin. Oral therapy depends on bacterial isolation and sensitivity. Recent studies question the need for long courses of intravenous cefotaxime when a short course of intravenous cefixime followed by oral therapy yields comparable results.

The selection of appropriate treatment requires review of local antimicrobial resistance patterns and compliant caretakers who understand the seriousness of the infection, the need for exact antibiotic dosing and the importance of maintaining close contact with the treating physician. Oral antibiotics are sufficient for use in older children who present with high fever, abdominal or flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness if they do not appear to be toxic. Suitable medication choices include cefixime, other extended-spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, TMP-SMX and, occasionally, quinolones. Other important therapeutic considerations include reducing urinary stasis by encouraging liberal fluid intake and frequent voiding. Children also should be evaluated for constipation, which can compress the urethra or the bladder neck.

Young children experiencing their first or second UTI should remain on oral prophylactic therapy until they undergo a voiding cystourethrogram. This test can be done safely as soon as the urine is sterile. Children with recurrent UTIs may require prophylactic therapy for six to 12 months to reduce morbidity. The authors conclude that treatment of UTI with oral antibiotics is usually effective, even in younger children with pyelonephritis. Cefixime is a useful empiric choice. Children who appear toxic or who cannot tolerate oral medication should be hospitalized for initial intravenous therapy. Radiographic studies can be performed before completion of antibiotic therapy. Caretakers should be educated about the risk of recurrence and advised when to seek medical attention.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^f79ff41f]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is no evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of routine investigation of children with confirmed UTI. There is limited evidence that routine imaging to detect VUR, following first UTI in older children, has no effect on recurrence or renal scarring.

High quality primary research on the effectiveness, in terms of improved patient outcome, of testing at all stages in the investigation of confirmed UTI is urgently required.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e6fdfc78]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^60df4b65]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

Children with severe clinical presentation need further investigation regarding urological pathology and VUR. In the absence of these, there is no evidence of benefit for CAP in children after severe presentation.

The most relevant non-urologic underlying condition is renal transplant. Although acute UTI negatively impacts graft function, it remains unclear whether CAP can prevent posttransplant UTI. Children with other conditions may receive antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, immunocompromised), but there is no data supporting the benefit specifically to prevent UTI.

Although there are no RCTs in neonates and infants < 2 m, systematic reviews suggest CAP may be useful in high-grade antenatal hydronephrosis, hydronephrosis with ureteral dilatation or hydronephrosis in uncircumcised infants.

### Technical report-diagnosis and management of an initial UTI in febrile infants and young children [^4ac27ba1]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are clinically challenging. This report was developed to inform the revised, evidence-based, clinical guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of initial UTIs in febrile infants and young children, 2 to 24 months of age, from the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.

Methods

The conceptual model presented in the 1999 technical report was updated after a comprehensive review of published literature. Studies with potentially new information or with evidence that reinforced the 1999 technical report were retained. Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI were performed.

Results

Review of recent literature revealed new evidence in the following areas. Certain clinical findings and new urinalysis methods can help clinicians identify febrile children at very low risk of UTI. Oral antimicrobial therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in treating UTI. Data from published, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI when vesicoureteral reflux is found through voiding cystourethrography. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract after the first UTI has poor sensitivity. Early antimicrobial treatment may decrease the risk of renal damage from UTI.

Conclusions

Recent literature agrees with most of the evidence presented in the 1999 technical report, but meta-analyses of data from recent, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI. This finding argues against voiding cystourethrography after the first UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^27a3e613]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%", and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used". For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%", a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time", and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%"; for circumcised boys at "0.2%", it "is 99%". Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI". Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)", "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive", "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially".

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.
