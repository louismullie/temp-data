## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting an arterial blood gas in a patient with suspected overdose, tinnitus, vomiting, and dehydration, specifically identifying the acid-base disorder, its likely cause, and the expected clinical manifestations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ABG values and whether pH, PaCO2, and HCO3- indicate acidosis or alkalosis and whether the process is respiratory, metabolic, or mixed. Then, I should verify the expected compensations to see if this is a pure process or a mixed disorder. Next, I will correlate the clinical picture with salicylate toxicity, which classically produces a mixed respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis. Finally, I will outline the key clinical manifestations and the pathophysiology that ties them together, making sure I double-check that the compensation math aligns with the expected patterns.

> Let me first confirm the ABG interpretation. The pH is 7.43, which is at the high end of normal, PaCO2 is 30 mmHg indicating hypocapnia, and bicarbonate is 20 mmol/L indicating a mild metabolic acidosis. Wait, let me verify the directionality: a low PaCO2 with a low HCO3- and a pH near normal suggests a mixed disorder rather than a pure process, and in salicylate poisoning the classic pattern is a primary respiratory alkalosis with a secondary metabolic acidosis, so the near-normal pH reflects compensation rather than absence of disturbance [^8f5ee0ba].

> I need to check the compensation expectations to ensure this fits. In a primary respiratory alkalosis, the expected metabolic compensation is a decrease in HCO3- by about 2–3 mmol/L for every 10 mmHg fall in PaCO2. Here, PaCO2 fell from 40 to 30 mmHg, so I would expect HCO3- to drop by roughly 2–3 mmol/L to about 21–22 mmol/L. The observed HCO3- of 20 mmol/L is slightly lower than that, which supports a concurrent mild metabolic acidosis superimposed on the respiratory alkalosis, confirming a mixed disorder rather than a pure respiratory alkalosis alone [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without tying it to the clinical context. Tinnitus, vomiting, and dehydration in an overdose presentation are classic for salicylate toxicity, where salicylates directly stimulate the medullary respiratory center causing hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis, while simultaneously causing a metabolic acidosis via uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and accumulation of organic acids. I should confirm that this mixed pattern is indeed the hallmark of salicylate poisoning, which it is in clinical reviews and case-based discussions [^8f5ee0ba].

> Next, I should review the clinical manifestations of this acid-base pattern. The respiratory alkalosis drives hyperventilation and tachypnea, which can be prominent early, while the metabolic acidosis contributes to nausea, vomiting, and can progress to altered mental status as salicylate levels rise and CNS toxicity emerges. Tinnitus is a classic early sign of salicylate toxicity and, together with vomiting and dehydration, strengthens the causal link to salicylate overdose in this scenario [^8f5ee0ba].

> Let me synthesize the answers clearly. a) The imbalance is a mixed respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis, not a single pure disorder. b) The most likely cause in this clinical context is salicylate overdose, which produces a primary respiratory alkalosis from medullary stimulation with a secondary metabolic acidosis from metabolic derangements. c) The clinical manifestations include hyperventilation and tachypnea from the respiratory alkalosis, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, with tinnitus and potential neurologic compromise as salicylate toxicity progresses, all of which match this presentation [^8f5ee0ba].

---

The ABG shows a **compensated respiratory alkalosis** [^95bfdfc1] due to hyperventilation from salicylate overdose [^8f5ee0ba], with pH near-normal, low PaCO2, and low HCO3−. The tinnitus, vomiting, and dehydration are classic for salicylate toxicity [^8f5ee0ba], which causes direct respiratory stimulation and a mixed respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis; the ABG reflects early compensation. Management includes urgent salicylate level, activated charcoal if within 1 hour, aggressive IV fluids, and consideration of urinary alkalinization and hemodialysis if severe [^8f5ee0ba].

## Interpretation of arterial blood gas results

| **Parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** |
|-|-|-|
| pH | 7.43 | 7.35–7.45 |
| PaCO2 | 30 mmHg | 35–45 mmHg |
| HCO3− | 20 mmol/L | 22–28 mmol/L |

---

The pH is normal, but the low PaCO2 and low HCO3− indicate a **respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation** [^95bfdfc1]. This pattern is typical of salicylate toxicity, which causes direct stimulation of the respiratory center (hyperventilation) and a concurrent metabolic acidosis from interference with cellular metabolism [^8f5ee0ba].

---

## Pathophysiology of salicylate toxicity

Salicylates stimulate the medullary respiratory center, causing hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis; concurrently, they uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, increasing lactate and ketoacid production, yielding a metabolic acidosis [^8f5ee0ba]. Early on, the respiratory alkalosis predominates, so pH may be normal or slightly alkaline despite a mixed disorder [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations of salicylate toxicity

Salicylate toxicity presents with a characteristic constellation of symptoms, including:

- **Tinnitus**: Often the earliest sign of salicylate toxicity, occurring even at therapeutic doses [^8f5ee0ba].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common due to direct irritation and metabolic disturbances.
- **Neurological symptoms**: Headache, dizziness, confusion, and altered mental status may occur, particularly in chronic toxicity [^8f5ee0ba].
- **Metabolic disturbances**: Dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances are frequent due to vomiting and renal losses.

---

## Management of salicylate toxicity

Immediate management includes:

- **Activated charcoal**: Administer if ingestion occurred within 1 hour and the airway is protected [^8f5ee0ba].
- **Aggressive intravenous fluids**: Correct dehydration and support perfusion.
- **Urinary alkalinization**: Enhances renal clearance of salicylates by increasing urine pH [^8f5ee0ba].
- **Hemodialysis**: Consider in severe cases (e.g. altered mental status, refractory acidosis, salicylate level > 100 mg/dL) [^8f5ee0ba].

---

The ABG reflects a **compensated respiratory alkalosis** from salicylate-induced hyperventilation, with metabolic compensation; the clinical picture is classic for salicylate toxicity and requires prompt recognition and treatment [^8f5ee0ba].

1 INTRODUCTION

Arthritis underlies about 40% of cases of chronic pain, 1 and understanding the cause of this pain is essential in developing new analgesics. During inflammation, sensory neurones innervating joints become sensitized, 2, 3, 4, 5 which contributes to the tenderness of arthritic joints. 6, 7 The inflammatory milieu contains many mediators, including protons, and early measurements of synovial fluid pH from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients found a pH of 7.21, compared with 7.43 in healthy subjects. 8 Similar acidosis was observed by others, 9, 10 with a fourth study showing that RA synovial fluid can become very acidic (pH 6.61 versus pH 7.30). 11 However, a more recent study found that, although RA synovial fluid was more acidic than that of synovial fluid from osteoarthritis (OA) patients, neither was acidic (RA pH ~ 7.5 and OA pH ~ 7.65). 12 Moreover, the reported pH range shows clear individual variation: pH ~ 6.84‐7.43, 9 and pH ~ 6.95‐7.75, 12 suggesting that acidosis is not necessarily a common feature of arthritis. Several studies have found a correlation between synovial lactate concentration and acidosis, 9, 12, 13 and it has been suggested that acidosis results from inflammation, where glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and then to lactic acid under the relatively anaerobic conditions of arthritic synovial fluid, where low pH and lactic acid concentrations correlate with low O 2 concentration. 9, 10, 14

Introduction: Measurement of CO2 concentrations in the expired air directly indicates changes in the elimination of CO2 from the lungs. In a healthy person, end tidal CO2 (elimination of PCO2 from alveolar) is lower than PaCO2 (arterial PCO2) by 2-5 mmHg. The Arterial to end-tidal CO2 pressure gradient [(a-ET) PCO2]is dependent on the amount of alveolar dead space. Negative (a-ET) PCO2 values were observed with increased cardiac output and increased CO2 production, reduced FRC and low compliance. Thus, (a-ET) PCO2 monitoring can be used as a simple index of pulmonary blood flow.The objective of this study was to investigate the association between (a-ET) PCO2 and mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

Methods: We retrospective studied 197 intubated patients undergoing mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure patients between 2014 and 2015 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. PaCO2 to end-tidal CO2 pressure gradient with clinical data and outcomes were measured after admission.

Results: Forty patients with negative (a-ET) PCO2 values had lower mortality, lower FiO2 setting, lower respiratory rate and higher blood pressure (Table 1). Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with Age(<65yr), gender(male), PaO2/FiO2(<300) and minute volume(>8L/min) were 0.078(0.010-0.624), 0.148(0.042-0.521), 0.089(0.011-0.701) and 0.229(0.075-0.698), respectively (Table 2). Negative (a-ET) PCO2 was strongly associated with good outcome and were significantly associated with overall survival (Fig. 1)

Conclusions: In conclusion, the negative arterial to end-tidal CO2 pressure gradient may predict patient survival in some subgroups.

### A man with dizziness and altered mental status | NEJM resident 360 (...) [^8f5ee0ba]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published January 18, 2023 Anion-gap metabolic acidosis, in combination with hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis and altered mental status, is suggestive of salicylate toxicity. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. A: Salicylates activate the respiratory center of the medulla, causing hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Tachypnea and increased respiratory effort can be clues for early diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. Salicylates cause metabolic acidosis through interference with both cellular metabolism in the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as through accumulation of unbound salicylate molecules. Tinnitus is a side effect that can occur even with the use of therapeutic doses of salicylates, but it can also be a clue to salicylate toxicity. Q: What accounts for the neurologic findings associated with salicylate toxicity.

A: Unbound salicylate molecules easily cross the blood–brain barrier, which leads to altered mental status, neuroglycopenia, and cerebral edema. A: The acute form of salicylate toxicity often occurs in young persons who have a history of an overdose or a psychiatric condition. The diagnosis tends to be straightforward because patients often report the overdose or possess containers partially filled with salicylates. Chronic salicylate toxicity often occurs in older patients who inadvertently consume an excessive amount of nonprescription drugs that contain salicylates to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic back pain. A: Treatment with activated charcoal can be effective, particularly when it is administered within 2 hours after ingestion, but it should be given only to alert and cooperative patients. Dosing outside this window and repeat dosing may be justified in patients who are at risk for prolonged retention of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract.

Urinary alkalization is a key element in the management of both acute and chronic salicylate toxicity. After filtration across the glomerular basement membrane, salicylate undergoes both secretion and reabsorption by the proximal tubule. Increasing the urine pH to a level higher than the blood pH traps salicylate in the tubular lumen and increases urinary excretion. Hemodialysis is the most efficient way to enhance elimination of salicylate from the body.

### Protective effects of hypercapnic acidosis on ventilator-induced lung injury [^e038a0ac]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate whether respiratory acidosis modulates ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), we perfused (constant flow) 21 isolated sets of normal rabbit lungs, ventilated them for 20 min (pressure controlled ventilation [PCV] = 15 cm H(2)O) (Baseline) with an inspired CO(2) fraction adjusted for the partial pressure of CO(2) in the perfusate (PCO(2) approximately equal to 40 mm Hg), and then randomized them into three groups. Group A (control: n = 7) was ventilated with PCV = 15 cm H(2)O for three consecutive 20-min periods (T1, T2, T3). In Group B (high PCV/normocapnia; n = 7), PCV was given at 20 (T1), 25 (T2), and 30 (T3) cm H(2)O. The targeted PCO(2) was 40 mm Hg in Groups A and B. Group C (high PCV/hypercapnia; n = 7) was ventilated in the same way as Group B, but the targeted PCO(2) was approximately equal to 70 to 100 mm Hg. The changes (from Baseline to T3) in weight gain (Delta WG: g) and in the ultrafiltration coefficient (Delta K(f) = gr/min/ cm H(2)O/100g) and the protein and hemoglobin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used to assess injury. Group B experienced a significantly greater Delta WG (14.85 +/- 5.49 [mean +/- SEM] g) and Delta K(f) (1.40 +/- 0.49 g/min/cm H(2)O/100 g) than did either Group A (Delta WG = 0.70 +/- 0.43; Delta K(f) = 0.01 +/- 0.03) or Group C (Delta WG = 5.27 +/- 2.03 g; Delta K(f) = 0.25 +/- 0.12 g/min/cm H(2)O/ 100 g). BALF protein and hemoglobin concentrations (g/L) were higher in Group B (11.98 +/- 3.78 g/L and 1.82 +/- 0.40 g/L, respectively) than in Group A (2.92 +/- 0.75 g/L and 0.38 +/- 0.15 g/L) or Group C (5.71 +/- 1.88 g/L and 1.19 +/- 0.32 g/L). We conclude that respiratory acidosis decreases the severity of VILI in this model.

### Understanding solvent effects on adsorption and protonation in porous catalysts [^d0764b0a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Gas-phase reactions occurring in porous catalysts typically involve an initial adsorption into the pore phase (confinement), and a subsequent interaction with the acid site (either hydrogen-bonded or protonated), before the intrinsic activation step of the chemical reaction. The thermodynamics of liquid-phase reactions are more complex because both substrate and acid site energetics are affected by solvent interactions (Fig. 1),. The solvent identity affects the chemical potential of a proton through the formation of a solvent-dependent specific acid (a → b). In the case of a water-saturated zeolite pore, the proton spontaneously transfers to form a charged water cluster (Fig. 1, brown). This water cluster is a specific acid with unique proton transfer properties, compared to the framework-bound proton, which can have a significant impact on catalysis,,. The solvent identity also impacts the confinement step (b → c) through interactions that stabilize (or destabilize) the substrate (R) in the external liquid phase (∆ H solv, B) relative to the substrate in the pore phase (∆ H solv, C). Similarly, the hydrogen-bonding/protonation step (c → d) can be affected by the solvent identity because the structure of the specific acid is disrupted upon proton transfer. In this step, a solvent differentially affects the stability of the hydrogen-bonded or protonated adduct (∆ H solv, D) relative to the solvated proton and the pore-phase substrate (∆ H solv, C). The propensity for the proton to transfer to the substrate is affected by solvent interactions with all three of these species and is a major topic of investigation in this work. The solvent may also affect the intrinsic reaction barrier (E a,int, step d → TS) by stabilizing the transition state (∆ H solv, TS) relative to the reactant adduct in step d. While Fig. 1 is expressed in terms of enthalpies to emphasize activation barriers (which are purely enthalpic) in the discussion, a similar scheme can also be drawn in terms of Gibbs free energies, as solvent interactions can also have entropic effects that modify a reaction’s pre-exponential factor. Experimentally, the effect of solvent on each of the steps in Fig. 1 is challenging to decouple. As a result, one typically resorts to screening many solvents for the liquid-phase reaction of interest. Yet, identifying the optimal solvent by this brute force approach is time consuming and costly, and often a mixture of several solvents of a specific composition provides the most desired results –,,–. To elucidate the nuanced roles of solvents and improve the ability to predict solvent behavior, quantitative determination of the impact of solvents on the interactions between substrates and catalytic sites is essential, especially in non-ideal environments such as micropores of zeolites. Further, these data could be used to inform and assess predictive models based on empirical or first principles calculations, eventually leading to model-based selection of solvents. However, quantitative experimental determination of energetics of liquid-phase reactions catalyzed by porous solids is challenging, as slow mass transport in the liquid-phase complicates the application of quantitative methods routinely used for gas-phase reactions, e.g. calorimetry.

Lipids—primary prevention recommendations: In adults who qualify for lipid-lowering therapy per the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline (for example, 20–75 years with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level ≥190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L], 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥20%, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%–<20% plus ≥1 risk enhancers), treatment with a statin is recommended to reduce the risk of a first stroke; in adults without CVD who meet similar criteria but cannot reach goals or tolerate other therapies such as statins, the benefit of alirocumab or evolocumab compared with other active lipid-lowering therapy for reducing first-stroke risk is uncertain; in adults who do not tolerate statins and have LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL with elevated cardiovascular risk, treatment with bempedoic acid to reduce first-stroke risk is not well established; and in adults with moderate or low intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation is not recommended to reduce the risk of a first stroke.

### Dose-related effects of prolonged NaHCO3 ingestion during high-intensity exercise [^07a08b95]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion may prevent exercise-induced perturbations in acid-base balance, thus resulting in performance enhancement. This study aimed to determine whether different levels of NaHCO3 intake influences acid-base balance and performance during high-intensity exercise after 5 d of supplementation.

Methods

Twenty-four men (22 +/- 1.7 yr) were randomly assigned to one of three groups (eight subjects per group): control (C, placebo), moderate NaHCO3 intake (MI, 0.3 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)), and high NaHCO3 intake (HI, 0.5 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Arterial pH, HCO3(-), PO2, PCO2, K+, Na, base excess (BE), lactate, and mean power (MP) were measured before and after a Wingate test pre- and postsupplementation.

Results

HCO3(-) increased proportionately to the dosage level. No differences were detected in C. Supplementation increased MP (W x kg(-)) in MI (7.36 +/- 0.7 vs 6.73 +/- 1.0) and HI (7.72 +/- 0.9 vs 6.69 +/- 0.6), with HI being more effective than MI. NaHCO3 ingestion resulted postexercise in increased lactate (mmol x L(-1)) (12.3 +/- 1.8 vs 10.3 +/- 1.9 and 12.4 +/- 1.2 vs 10.4 +/- 1.5 in MI and HI, respectively), reduced exercise-induced drop of pH (7.305 +/- 0.04 vs 7.198 +/- 0.02 and 7.343 +/- 0.05 vs 7.2 +/- 0.01 in MI and HI, respectively) and HCO3(-) (mmol x L(-1)) (13.1 +/- 2.4 vs 17.5 +/- 2.8 and 13.2 +/- 2.7 vs 19.8 +/- 3.2 for HCO3 in MI and HI, respectively), and reduced K (3.875 +/- 0.2 vs 3.625 +/- 0.3 mmol x L(-1) in MI and HI, respectively).

Conclusion

NaHCO3 administration for 5 d may prevent acid-base balance disturbances and improve performance during anaerobic exercise in a dose-dependent manner.

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^4609ab60]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Apnea testing—pre-test PaCO2 and pH targets and chronic hypercarbia handling (Recommendation Statements 24a–24c). Clinicians must ensure that patients have normal PaCO2 (35–45 mm Hg) and pH (7.35–7.45) levels before apnea testing, provided the patient is not known to be hypercarbic at baseline (Level A). If a patient is known to have chronic hypercarbia, and the patient's chronic baseline level is known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's chronic baseline level (Level B). If a patient is known or suspected to have chronic hypercarbia but the patient's chronic baseline PaCO2 level is not known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's estimated chronic baseline. However, in this circumstance, if apnea is present, clinicians should perform ancillary testing in addition (Level A).

### Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: a study of 577 patients defines the genotype as a biomarker for disease severity and survival [^61725af9]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a multifaceted monogenic disorder with a broad disease spectrum and variable disease severity and a variety of treatment options including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT). No reliable biomarker exists to predict disease course and outcome for individual patients. A total of 577 patients with a WAS variant from 26 countries and a median follow-up of 8.9 years (range, 0.3-71.1), totaling 6118 patient-years, were included in this international retrospective study. Overall survival (OS) of the cohort (censored at HSCT or GT) was 82% (95% confidence interval, 78-87) at age 15 years and 70% (61-80) at 30 years. The type of variant was predictive of outcome: patients with a missense variant in exons 1 or 2 or with the intronic hot spot variant c.559+5G>A (class I variants) had a 15-year OS of 93% (89-98) and a 30-year OS of 91% (86-97), compared with 71% (62-81) and 48% (34-68) in patients with any other variant (class II; P < .0001). The cumulative incidence rates of disease-related complications such as severe bleeding (P = .007), life-threatening infection (P < .0001), and autoimmunity (P = .004) occurred significantly later in patients with a class I variant. The cumulative incidence of malignancy (P = .6) was not different between classes I and II. It confirms the spectrum of disease severity and quantifies the risk for specific disease-related complications. The class of the variant is a biomarker to predict the outcome for patients with WAS.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^be011ff9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Generally, BE range between − 2 and + 2 mmol/L is considered normal. Clinical examples of abnormal BE values are reported in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 
Gamblegrams of different acid–base conditions. A Normal conditions. This Gamblegram, i.e. the graph summarizing the electrical charges and the concept of electrical neutrality, represents a normal situation, with standard concentrations of electrolytes and normal acid–base parameters (HCO 3 − 24 mmol/L, PCO 2 40 mmHg and pH of 7.40), leading to a SBE of 0 mmol/L. B Lactatemia. In this situation, lactate concentration is increased by 6 mmol/L and pH is 7.31. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. HCO 3 − concentration is decreased to 20 mmol/L and BE is − 6 mmol/L. This is an example of isolated metabolic acidosis. C Hypochloremia. In this situation, chloride concentration is decreased by 5 mmol/L and pH is 7.47. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. HCO 3 − concentration is increased to 29 mmol/L and BE is + 5 mmol/L. This is an example of isolated metabolic alkalosis, which can frequently be observed in case of persistent vomiting or after administration of loop diuretics. D Lactatemia and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3). In this situation, lactate concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L and sodium concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L due to the administration of NaHCO 3. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. As the increase in cations is equal to the increase in anions, no other change in electrolytes is required to fulfill the electroneutrality principle, i.e. HCO 3 − concentration is unaffected (24 mmol/L) and pH is 7.40. Therefore, two acid–base disorders co-exist and cancel each other out. Consequently, the calculated SBE is 0 mmol/L. Of note, the columns are higher than normal, underlining the fact that sodium-bicarbonate administration causes an increase in osmolarity. E Hyponatremia, hypochloremia and ketoacids. In this situation, sodium and chloride concentrations are reduced by 20 and 30 mmol/L, respectively. At the same time, 10 mmol/L of ketoacids are present. Also in this case, variations in strong cations and anions cancel out each other and, assuming a normal PCO 2 of 40 mmHg, normal values of pH and HCO 3 − are expected, leading to a normal SBE of 0 mmol/L. This acid–base derangement can be observed in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, where electrolyte losses due to persistent vomiting can coexist with hypovolemia and starvation ketoacidosis. HCO 3 −, bicarbonate; A −, dissociated non-carbonic weak acids; Lac −, lactate; Ket −, ketoacids

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^c59b8670]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease metabolic acidosis—trial evidence and certainty: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. A 2021 systematic review identified 15 trials with ≥3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study medication on kidney outcomes. Of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 1 new trial has been published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important kidney effect of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease and/or hypoxia (Recommendation Table 23A—diagnosis, optimization, and referral)—If PH is suspected in patients with lung disease, it is recommended that echocardiography be performed and the results interpreted in conjunction with arterial blood gas (ABG), pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and computed tomography (CT) imaging. In patients with lung disease and suspected PH, it is recommended to optimize treatment of the underlying lung disease and, where indicated, hypoxaemia, sleep-disordered breathing, and/or alveolar hypoventilation. In patients with lung disease and suspected severe PH, or where there is uncertainty regarding the treatment of PH, referral to a PH centre is recommended. In patients with lung disease and severe PH, an individualized approach to treatment is recommended. It is recommended to refer eligible patients with lung disease and PH for lung transplantation (LTx) evaluation. In patients with lung disease and suspected PH, right heart catheterization (RHC) is recommended if the results are expected to aid management decisions. Assessments should ideally be made when the patient is clinically stable, as exacerbations can significantly raise pulmonary artery pressure, and the LTx recommendation does not apply to patients with end-stage lung disease who are not considered candidates for LTx.

Introduction: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening condition. It activates immune cells response, which promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines and perpetuates the apoptosis and necrosis cascade, leading to hemodynamic instability. The use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using blood purification adsorption devices may have an important role in improving patient outcomes by removing the excessive circulating inflammatory mediators.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of five patients with ALF and without concurrent bacterial infection which initiated CRRT with oXiris®. Acid-base balance, lactate levels and vasopressor dose were recorded every 6 hours during the first 24 hours.

Results: Five patients (80% male), mean age of 36.4±6.7 years. Admission APACHE score 32.6±5.6. ALF etiologies were primary graft dysfunction (60%), acetaminophen intoxication (20%) and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection (20%). Acid-base balance before CRRT showed pH 7.25±0.07 and HCO3 - 13.15±6.15mmol/L. All patients were under vasopressor support with noradrenaline (NA) with a mean dose of 1.9±2.7mcgr/kg/min and blood lactate of 11.2±0.14mmol/L. Mean effluent rate 42.5±3.5mL/kg/h. During the first 24 hours of CRRT there was a rise in the mean pH (7.37±0.03) and HCO3 - (23.1±0.28mmol/L) values, a progressive decrease in the vasopressor perfusion dose (0.30 mcgr/kg/min) and blood lactate (2.3±0.0mmol/L) without worsening of the hemodynamic status. Differences in acid-base and blood lactate values before and after 24 hours of CRRT with oXiris® appears to be statistically significative (p-value <0.05). Hospital mortality rate of 40%.

Conclusions: The use of adsorbent membranes may play a part in acute liver failure patients by reducing circulating proinflammatory mediators responsible for hemodynamic instability, thus improving survival and outcomes.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach-AAFP (...) [^be8917df]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in patients who are critically ill. 1 A systematic approach to evaluating these disorders provides vital diagnostic information and guides timely treatment. 2–5 Acidosis leads to acidemia 6 and is typically due to one of three factors: accumulation of acids or loss of alkali; decreased renal excretion of acid; or accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. Alkalosis is a process that leads to alkalemia and is primarily caused by excessive carbon dioxide exhalation, the accumulation of alkali, or loss of acid.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^a45b643b]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Asians/South Asians—management and statin therapy evidence indicates that lifestyle therapy including a diet low in saturated and trans fats, with weight loss if overweight/obese and increased physical activity should be the first-line and mainstay of treatment for the management of dyslipidemia in Asians/SAs, pharmacologic therapy should be directed at non-HDL-C and LDL-C targets, and statins should generally be first-line drug therapy for patients of Asian/SA ethnicity. In a large randomized trial (Investigation of Rosuvastatin in South Asians) of 740 patients with hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Canada, subjects received 6 weeks of treatment with rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg, LDL-C decreased by 45% and 40% with 10 mg rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively, and by 50% and 47% with 20 mg rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively, and LDL-C goal was achieved by 76% and 88% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 and 20 mg, respectively, and by 70% and 81% of patients receiving atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg, respectively.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^f8be9a0b]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO dialysis interventions for treatment of AKI—RRT initiation, decision context, discontinuation, and diuretics: Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist (Not Graded). Consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests—rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone—when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required, either because intrinsic kidney function has recovered to the point that it is adequate to meet patient needs, or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded). We suggest not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery, or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT (2B).

### Round table discussion: ACIDOSIS AND ALKALOSIS (...) [^90d5b0e4]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

3/HHCO 3 ratio, and alkalosis as an increase. When BHCO 3 is primarily affected, the disturbance is referred to as metabolic in origin; when HHCO 3 concentration is the first to be altered, the resulting change is considered to be of respiratory origin. Primary changes of either BHCO 3 or HHCO 3 usually stimulate compensatory changes in the other which tend to restore the original normal ratio. When compensation for acidosis is incomplete, an increased H + ion concentration of the blood results, and such a change is referred to as acidemia. The opposite condition is called alkalemia. From the clinical point of view a much broader concept of acidosis and alkalosis exists and includes in addition all related changes in metabolism which may give rise to definite symptoms and signs of illness.

Such metabolic changes may be either primary or secondary, and, as either, may be very important in determining prognosis as to life or death. In practice one is prompted to consider the possibility of acidosis or alkalosis by noting suspicious signs or symptoms and then diagnoses with certainty the presence and extent of change by chemical determinations of serum CO 2 content and pH. The most important signs and symptoms of acidosis are: hyperpnea, which is considered not primary, stupor, dehydration, ketosis and strongly acid urine. Any or all may be absent. The most important signs and symptoms of alkalosis are: depressed respiration, considered compensatory, or hyperventilation, considered primary, tetany, and forceful vomiting, thought to be the result of pyloric or high intestinal obstruction, and strongly alkaline urine. For absolute diagnosis of acidosis or alkalosis two of the three variables, BHCO 3, HHCO 3 and pH have to be determined.

Since pH and BHCO 3 usually move in the same direction, it has been widespread clinical practice to determine only BHCO 3 by determining serum CO 2 content by the Van Slyke manometric method. In this connection it should be remembered that when so determined about 20/21 of the CO 2 comes from BHCO 3, the remainder coming from HHCO 3 In the past it was customary not to separate BHCO 3 and HHCO 3, but to record them together as the total CO 2 content.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^3e8dff37]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024—Evidence base for treating metabolic acidosis in CKD: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. A 2021 systematic review identified 15 trials with ≥3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study medication; of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 were published since 2012, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important modifying effect on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).
