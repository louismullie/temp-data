## Question

What are the common locations of growing pains in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common locations of growing pains in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how growing pains are defined and which clinical features are most consistent across sources. Then, I should verify the most frequently reported anatomic locations and whether the pain is unilateral or bilateral. Next, I will check whether any upper limb or axial sites are ever involved and how often. After that, I should review whether the pain is articular or non-articular and whether specific muscle groups are implicated. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and note any exceptions or red flags that would prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the core definition so I don't anchor on a single study. Growing pains are typically described as intermittent, non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pains in children, most often in the lower limbs, with evening or nighttime predominance, bilateral involvement, and normal physical examination between episodes, though definitions vary widely across the literature and there is no universally accepted diagnostic standard, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization [^111ZxZqL] [^115f7hJZ].

> Wait, let me verify the most consistent location signal. Across scoping reviews and multiple series, the most consistent component is lower limb pain, cited in roughly half of sources, which supports the clinical impression that growing pains cluster in the legs rather than the arms or trunk, even though individual studies differ in detail and many do not specify exact sites [^111ZxZqL] [^115f7hJZ].

> I will now examine specific anatomic regions within the lower limbs. In a representative case series of 30 children, 80% had bilateral lower limb involvement and the pain localized to the shins, calves, thighs, or popliteal fossa, which aligns with classic descriptions and reinforces the bilateral, muscular distribution rather than joint-centric pain, and this pattern is echoed in broader reviews noting frequent calf, shin, and posterior knee involvement [^112r6SwP] [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about laterality. I initially thought unilateral presentations might be uncommon, but I should double-check the balance of evidence. Multiple sources emphasize bilateral involvement as a hallmark, with one scoping review counting 45 studies specifying bilateral symptoms versus only 1 stating usually unilateral, and a prospective series showing 80% bilateral cases, so while unilateral complaints can occur, they are atypical and should prompt closer scrutiny for mimics or alternate diagnoses [^115f7hJZ] [^112r6SwP].

> Next, I should review whether upper limb or axial sites are ever involved. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall reading that growing pains are "never" in the arms or back, but I need to check that absolutist claim. Some studies and reviews note that while predominantly lower limb, occasional reports mention arms, shoulders, back, groin, or ligamentous/tendinous pain, albeit far less commonly, so I should correct myself and state that upper limb or axial involvement is rare and atypical rather than impossible, and when present, it should raise caution about the diagnosis [^115f7hJZ] [^111NoEMB].

> Let me consider the nature of the pain localization. I should confirm whether the pain is articular or non-articular. Most consistent descriptions characterize growing pains as non-articular muscular pain affecting the calves, shins, thighs, and occasionally the popliteal fossa, with normal joints on examination between episodes, which helps distinguish them from inflammatory arthritides and other joint-centric conditions [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ].

> But wait, what if the child reports knee pain specifically. I need to ensure I'm not conflating anterior knee pain syndromes with growing pains. Patellofemoral pain and traction apophysitis such as Osgood-Schlatter disease are common in adolescents and typically present with focal, activity-related anterior knee pain and localizable tenderness, which are not classic for growing pains; thus, true knee joint pain should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses rather than attributing it to growing pains by default [^1124UXCo] [^115kQpw5].

> I should also review associated features that support the localization pattern. Growing pains are typically episodic, often evening or nighttime, with complete resolution by morning and no objective inflammatory signs, and they frequently follow days of increased physical activity; these temporal and examination features co-occur with the bilateral lower limb muscular distribution and help corroborate the clinical picture when localization is described by caregivers or children [^111NoEMB] [^111ZxZqL].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the weight of evidence. The most common locations of growing pains in children are the lower limbs, specifically the calves, shins (tibial region), thighs, and the popliteal fossa (posterior knee), with pain typically bilateral and non-articular; upper limb, back, or groin involvement is reported only rarely and should be considered atypical, and when present, clinicians should reassess for alternative diagnoses or overlapping pain syndromes [^112r6SwP] [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ].

---

Growing pains in children most commonly occur in the **lower limbs** [^111ZxZqL], especially the **calves, shins, thighs, and behind the knees** (popliteal fossa) [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ]. The pain is typically **bilateral** [^111ZxZqL], non-articular, and episodic, often in the evening or at night [^111NoEMB], with normal physical examination and no redness or swelling [^112P49fr]. Upper limb involvement is rare, and joint pain is not typical [^111ZxZqL] [^111NoEMB].

---

## Common locations of growing pains

Growing pains predominantly affect the **lower limbs** [^111ZxZqL], with the following regions most commonly involved:

| **Location** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Calves | Posterior lower leg muscles; frequently reported [^111NoEMB] |
| Shins | Anterior lower leg; commonly affected [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ] |
| Thighs | Upper leg muscles; common site of pain [^111NoEMB] |
| Popliteal fossa | Behind the knee; frequently involved [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ] |

---

These locations align with the **most consistent clinical feature** of growing pains: lower limb pain [^111ZxZqL] [^115f7hJZ].

---

## Characteristics of growing pains

Growing pains exhibit several **distinct characteristics** that help differentiate them from other pediatric musculoskeletal conditions:

- **Bilateral involvement**: Pain typically affects both limbs, although not necessarily symmetrically [^111ZxZqL] [^115f7hJZ].
- **Non-articular**: Pain is muscular rather than joint-related, with no redness, swelling, or tenderness of joints [^111ZxZqL] [^111NoEMB].
- **Episodic nature**: Pain occurs intermittently, often in the evening or at night, and resolves spontaneously by morning [^111ZxZqL] [^111NoEMB].
- **Normal physical examination**: No abnormal findings are present on physical examination or laboratory tests [^112r6SwP] [^111ZxZqL].

---

## Less common locations

While the lower limbs are the primary sites, growing pains can occasionally involve other regions, though **upper limb involvement is rare** [^111ZxZqL] [^115f7hJZ]. Less common locations include the **arms, shoulders, back, groin, and ligaments or tendons** [^115f7hJZ].

---

## Clinical significance of location

The specific locations of growing pains have **clinical implications**:

- **Differentiation from other conditions**: The non-articular, bilateral, lower limb distribution helps distinguish growing pains from inflammatory or infectious conditions [^111NoEMB].
- **Parental reassurance**: Understanding the typical locations and characteristics of growing pains can reassure parents and reduce anxiety [^111NoEMB].
- **Avoidance of unnecessary investigations**: Recognizing the typical pattern of growing pains prevents unnecessary laboratory or imaging studies [^112P49fr].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **Most common locations**: Calves, shins, thighs, and popliteal fossa [^111NoEMB] [^115f7hJZ].
- **Typical characteristics**: Bilateral, non-articular, episodic, normal physical examination [^111ZxZqL] [^111NoEMB].
- **Less common locations**: Arms, shoulders, back, groin, ligaments, and tendons [^115f7hJZ].
- **Clinical significance**: Helps differentiate from other pediatric musculoskeletal conditions and guides appropriate management [^112P49fr].

---

Growing pains in children most commonly occur in the **lower limbs**, particularly the calves, shins, thighs, and popliteal fossa [^111NoEMB]. The pain is typically bilateral, non-articular, and episodic, with a normal physical examination [^111NoEMB]. Recognizing these typical locations and characteristics is essential for accurate diagnosis, parental reassurance, and avoidance of unnecessary investigations [^112P49fr].

Studies of the cumulative impact of opioid exposure during childhood and adolescence — brain structure and function changes have been identified with frequent or heavy use of potentially addictive substances; opioids should be used for severe acute pain that otherwise would be insufficiently controlled, yet in a small percentage of individuals opioids can precipitate an OUD, and relatively little is known about the consequences of short- and long-term exposure and repeated treatment episodes during critical developmental periods to inform counseling of patients and families about potential risk.

### Pain assessment tools for use in infants: a meta-review [^111vES36]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain occurs across the continuum of life. However, for those who cannot self-report their pain, such as pre-verbal children, those with intellectual disability and those with neurological disorders who have lost the ability to communicate (e.g. people living with advanced dementia), there is evidence that their pain often goes under-recognized and under-treated. Research clearly indicates that accurate pain assessment in infants is a challenge for health care professionals. The problem of differentiating or discriminating pain from other expressions of unpleasant feelings or experiences, such as hunger, fear or distress adds to the complexity of assessing pain in this group.

In the absence of infants' ability to self-report, observation of behaviours such as facial expression, crying, hand and leg movements is a valid approach for pain assessment. However, pain behaviours are not specific reflections of pain intensity or distress, and the context of infant's behaviour must be considered when using this approach.

Herr et al. report that typically children as young as 3 years may be able to report pain using basic tools, however it is not until 8 years of age that children are generally considered reliable in using a numerical rating scale. In clinical practice, Eccleston et al. in support of Beltramini et al. suggest that self-reported measures of pain (e.g. numerical scales) can be used for children aged 6 years and older, while behavioral scales can be used for children aged below 6 years or those unable to verbally report. According to the American Society of Pain Management Nursing (APSMN) position statement on pain assessment in the patient unable to self-report, health care professionals should search for potential causes of pain and use both primary behavioral categories and behavioral pain tools for initial and ongoing assessment of pain.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pain, more specifically with respect to assessment scales, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using the FLACC scale in very young pediatric patients and pediatric patients ≤ 4 years old, where each domain is scored from 0–2 to give a score of 0–10, the scores suggest accordingly:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|0|- No pain|
|1–3|- Mild pain|
|4–6|- Moderate pain|
|7–10|- Severe pain.|

### Joint hypermobility and growing pains in school children [^113ZDTz7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the association between growing pains (GP) and joint hypermobility (HM), children aged 3–9 were examined for the coexistence of HM and GP.

Methods

The study group consisted of 433 children (219 boys, 214 girls; age range 3–9 years) from one public school in Mumbai, India. In the assessment of HM, the Beighton criteria were used. Any child who met ≥ 5/9 criteria was considered to have HM. Children were considered to have GP if they fulfilled the Petersons criteria, namely the pains were bilateral, intermittent non-articular pains involving the lower limbs; typically occurring during late afternoons or evenings with a normal physical examination and normal laboratory parameters whenever performed. The assessment of HM and GP were carried out independently. Children with bilateral knee hypermobility were also evaluated for the occurrence of GP.

Results

Of the 433 children, 177 (40.8%) were found to have HM and 122 (28.1%) GP; 75 (61.4%) of the 122 with GP had HM and 75 (42.3%) of the 177 with HM had GP. Using chi square statistical analysis, joint hypermobility and GP were found to be highly associated. Knee hypermobility also showed significant statistical association with GP.

Conclusion

This study suggests that there is a strong association between joint hypermobility and GP in schoolchildren. It is possible that joint hypermobility may play a part in the pathogenesis of GP. More studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of this association.

### Young children's ability to report on past, future, and hypothetical pain states: a cognitive-developmental perspective [^111bAMj7]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Children are at times asked by clinicians or researchers to rate their pain associated with their past, future, or hypothetical experiences. However, little consideration is typically given to the cognitive-developmental requirements of such pain reports. Consequently, these pain assessment tasks may exceed the abilities of some children, potentially resulting in biased or random responses. This could lead to the over- or under-treatment of children's pain. This review provides an overview of factors, and specifically the cognitive-developmental prerequisites, that may affect a child's ability to report on nonpresent pain states, such as past, future, or hypothetical pain experiences. Children's ability to report on past pains may be influenced by developmental (age, cognitive ability), contextual (mood state, language used by significant others), affective and pain-related factors. The ability to mentally construct and report on future painful experiences may be shaped by memory of past experiences, information provision and learning, contextual factors, knowledge about oneself, cognitive coping style, and cognitive development. Hypothetical pain reports are sometimes used in the development and validation of pain assessment scales, as a tool in assessing cognitive-developmental and social-developmental aspects of children's reports of pain, and for the purposes of training children to use self-report scales. Rating pain associated with hypothetical pain scenarios requires the ability to recognize pain in another person and depends on the child's experience with pain. Enhanced understanding of cognitive-developmental requirements of young children's pain reports could lead to improved understanding, assessment, and treatment of pediatric pain.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^116tYSf7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

High-quality empirical evidence is important, but information provision is not enough

Providing pain relief in infants and young children is challenging (Table 1). Pain is a complex multifaceted individual experience that is difficult to describe. Fundamentally, pain is protective: it signals damage to an individual, it provides a mechanism to promote healing, it drives compassionate care in others, and it educates us on how to protect our bodies. When children undergo painful necessary invasive procedures, pain can be perceived as a mechanism for future protection. This complexity makes it difficult for parents to know how to respond to induced pain in the healthcare setting. Expectations that children should 'man-up', 'cope', or 'be brave' are confusing. This conceptual confusion about the value of pain (by both parents and healthcare professionals) can be reduced through the provision of high-quality, accessible material that describes best evidence-based practice. Consensus-finding within this author-group identified key facts that need to be communicated to healthcare professionals and parents (Table 2). While these key aspects have been identified, further attention needs to be given to how this information is presented and delivered.

### Defining growing pains: a scoping review [^111ZxZqL]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Up to one third of children may be diagnosed with growing pains, but considerable uncertainty surrounds how to make this diagnosis. The objective of this study was to detail the definitions of growing pains in the medical literature.

Methods

Scoping review with 8 electronic databases and 6 diagnostic classification systems searched from their inception to January 2021. The study selection included peer-reviewed articles or theses referring to "growing pain(s)" or "growth pain(s)" in relation to children or adolescents. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers.

Results

We included 145 studies and 2 diagnostic systems (ICD-10 and SNOMED). Definition characteristics were grouped into 8 categories: pain location, age of onset, pain pattern, pain trajectory, pain types and risk factors, relationship to activity, severity and functional impact, and physical examination and investigations. There was extremely poor consensus between studies as to the basis for a diagnosis of growing pains. The most consistent component was lower limb pain, which was mentioned in 50% of sources. Pain in the evening or night (48%), episodic or recurrent course (42%), normal physical assessment (35%), and bilateral pain (31%) were the only other components to be mentioned in more than 30% of articles. Notably, more than 80% of studies made no reference to age of onset in their definition, and 93% did not refer to growth. Limitations of this study are that the included studies were not specifically designed to define growing pains.

Conclusions

There is no clarity in the medical research literature regarding what defines growing pain. Clinicians should be wary of relying on the diagnosis to direct treatment decisions.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^115uKkHG]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain in infants and young children matters

Children regularly experience needle-related procedures, such as vaccinations, blood draws, and intravenous cannulation. In the United Kingdom (UK), for example, from birth to 5 years of age, children receive 12 separate intramuscular injections to protect against serious diseases. These procedures are the number one source of pain in childhood, and concern about pain is a major barrier to uptake. We know that untreated pain causes short-term distress that negatively impacts child and parental wellbeing and shapes future attitudes to pain. Given we have the evidence-based tools to reduce needle-related pain in every child, every time, untreated pain is unjustifiable.

In this article, we use needle-related pain to highlight three concepts that are key to driving positive change in the treatment of childhood pain. We describe (i) how high-quality information for healthcare professionals and parents is needed to ensure effective pain management and to debunk myths, (ii) that healthcare professionals will prioritise childhood pain treatment if they are motivated to do so, and (iii) that children need advocates to ensure that their pain is considered and treated.

### Chronic pain in children and young people with cerebral palsy: a narrative review of challenges, advances, and future directions [^112D1DQC]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral palsy (CP), the most common physical disability of childhood, is often accompanied by a range of comorbidities including pain. Pain is highly prevalent in children and young people with CP, yet has been poorly understood, inaccurately assessed, and inadequately managed in this vulnerable population. This narrative review presents recent research advances for understanding and managing pain in children and young people with CP, focusing on chronic pain, and highlights future research directions.

Main Body

Pain prevalence rates in CP vary due to different methodologies of studies. Recent systematic reviews report up to 85% of children experience pain; higher in older children, females, and those with dyskinesia and greater motor impairment. Research examining the lived experience perspectives of children and their families demonstrate that even those with mild motor impairments have pain, children want to self-report pain where possible to feel heard and believed, and management approaches should be individualized. Notably, many children with cognitive and communication impairments can self-report their pain if adjustments are provided and they are given a chance. Past inadequacies of pain assessment in CP relate to a focus on pain intensity and frequency with little focus on pain interference and coping, a lack of tools appropriate for the CP population, and an assumption that many children with cognitive and/or communication limitations are unable to self-report. Recent systematic reviews have identified the most reliable and valid assessment tools for assessing chronic pain. Many were not developed for people with CP and, in their current form, are not appropriate for the spectrum of physical, communication, and cognitive limitations seen. Recently, consensus and co-design in partnership with people with lived experience and clinicians have identified tools appropriate for use in CP considering the biopsychosocial framework. Modifications to tools are underway to ensure feasibility and applicability for the spectrum of abilities seen.

Conclusion

Recent research advances have improved our understanding of the prevalence, characteristics and lived experience of chronic pain, and refined assessment methods in children and young people with CP. However, the very limited evidence for effective and novel management of chronic pain in this population is where research should now focus.

### Opioids for cancer-related pain in children and adolescents [^1147rDDR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. Views on children's pain have changed over time and relief of pain is now seen as important. In the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, and it was assumed that children quickly forgot about painful experiences. We designed a suite of seven reviews in chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) to review the evidence for children's pain using pharmacological interventions. As one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for children and adolescents in the world today, childhood cancer (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Cancer pain in infants, children, and adolescents is primarily nociceptive pain with negative long term effects. Cancer-related pain is generally caused directly by the tumour itself such as compressing on the nerve or inflammation of the organs. Cancer-related pain generally occurs as a result of perioperative procedures, nerve damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy treatments, or mucositis. However, this review focused on pain caused directly by the tumour itself such as nerve infiltration, external nerve compression, and other inflammatory events. Opioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. Currently available opioids include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most developed countries but access may be restricted in developing countries. To achieve adequate pain relief in children using opioids, with an acceptable grade of adverse effects, the recommended method is to start with a low dose gradually titrated to effect or unacceptable adverse effect in the child.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy, and adverse events, of opioids used to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid and Embase via Ovid from inception to 22 February 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with or without blinding, of any dose, and any route, treating cancer-related pain in children and adolescents, comparing opioids with placebo or an active comparator.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and planned to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

No studies were identified that were eligible for inclusion in this review (very low quality evidence). Several studies tested opioids on adults with cancer-related pain, but none in participants aged from birth to 17 years. We rated the quality of evidence as very low, downgraded due to a lack of available data; no analyses could be undertaken.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about efficacy or harm in the use of opioids to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents. As a result, there is no RCT evidence to support or refute the use of opioids to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents.

### The challenge of developing pain medications for children: therapeutic needs and future perspectives [^112G3mQK]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

It is broadly accepted that children of all age groups including (preterm) neonates and young infants can perceive pain and that there is an absolute need to treat their pain safely and effectively. The approved treatment options for children, particularly (preterm) neonates and young infants, are very limited with only a few medications specifically labelled for this population. This article presents the challenges of developing pain medications for children. A short overview gives information on pain in children, including pain perception, prevalence of pain and the long-term consequences of leaving pain untreated in this vulnerable population. Current pain management practices are briefly discussed. The challenges of conducting pediatric clinical trials in general and trials involving analgesic medications in particular within the regulatory framework available to develop these medications for children are presented. Emphasis is given to the operational hurdles faced in conducting a pediatric clinical trial program. Some suggestions to overcome these hurdles are provided based on our experience during the pediatric trial program for the strong analgesic tapentadol used for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^116sDX2x]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Children with cancer-related pain experience fluctuations in pain intensity. When exacerbations of medium-to-severe pain occur over the background of otherwise-controlled pain, it is commonly described as breakthrough pain. Subgroups of breakthrough pain include incidental pain, which is typically induced by a child's movements; end-of-dose failure, requiring adjustment of the dosing regimen; and spontaneous pain, where no obvious pathology is apparent. Breakthrough pain frequently occurs in conjunction with background pain that is well managed by analgesia (typically opioid medications plus adjuvants) in conjunction with integrative, nonpharmacological therapies. Breakthrough pain in adults is prevalent, with up to two-thirds of cancer patients affected.–A study of the characteristics and impact of breakthrough pain in adult patients with cancer pain demonstrated that breakthrough pain independently contributed to impaired functioning and psychological distress. Breakthrough pain was also associated with negative mood and the study confirmed that it is a prevalent and heterogeneous phenomenon. The likelihood of an adequate analgesic response to opioid therapy is diminished by the presence of breakthrough pain.

### Pain syndromes in children [^115yUXnJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

This review discusses the recent literature on pain conditions in children that should be of interest to rheumatologists. The focus of the review is therefore on musculoskeletal pains in children, particularly chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal pain. Articles that have a broader focus on pain are discussed when these are likely to be of general interest to rheumatologists. Chronic or recurrent pain in childhood is common and can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, several of which are discussed here. The importance of being able to measure pain in children has been emphasized repeatedly in the recent literature. With increased understanding of how to evaluate pain in children has come the recognition that pain in children is multifactorial and that even when there are obvious "organic" causes of the pain (such as arthritis), psychosocial factors are critical in how pain is perceived, and they influence the extent to which pain leads to dysfunction. There is also increasing evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapies are effective in managing chronic pain in children. The frequency of back pain in children is increasingly recognized, and the role of children's work and play, carrying heavy backpacks, and sitting for long periods of time at computers in causing back pain is of interest. The studies reviewed here add to an increasingly rich and informative literature on musculoskeletal and other chronic pain in children, and they help emphasize the importance of proper evaluation and management of pain in children.

### Early signs of long-term pain: prospective network profiles from late adolescence and lifelong follow-up [^112jBbp2]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-term pain and mental health problems represent by far the largest share of disability and injury burden today. Long-term pain causes disability in patients of all ages, leading to substantial suffering, an enormous economic burden, and loss of productivity in working-age groups. At any given moment, over 20% of the population experiences long-term pain. However, treatment options are limited because traditional analgesics are typically ineffective for long-term pain. Therefore, to avoid chronicity, identifying those with high risk is essential to provide preventive care and decrease pain incidence, and is a public health priority in the United States. Despite this need, there are currently no definitive demographics or clinical tests to predict who will develop long-term pain, despite previous attempts to forecast the future severity of pain in those already affected –.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain in children: assessment and management [^114P5yve]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Paediatricians and paediatric rheumatologists review a large number of children with ongoing pain (disease and non-disease related). A small number of these develop chronic pain conditions that are complex and distressing. Over recent years studies of the epidemiology, aetiology and rehabilitation of pain and pain-associated disability in children have revealed a large prevalence of clinically relevant pain, and have emphasized the need for early recognition and intervention. Medication has a role when part of a multidisciplinary framework, although there is little evidence for or against the effectiveness of most pharmacotherapy. There is strong evidence to support early targeted psychological and physical intervention, and an understanding that parental education and involvement is essential if progress is to be maintained. In this review, an overview of the assessment is presented and management of childhood chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions with reference to main research findings to date.

### Defining growing pains: a scoping review… [^115f7hJZ]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

The most consistent component was lower limb pain, which was mentioned in 50% of sources. Pain in the evening or night, episodic or recurrent course, normal physical assessment, and bilateral pain were the only other components to be mentioned in more than 30% of articles. Notably, more than 80% of studies made no reference to age of onset in their definition, and 93% did not refer to growth. Limitations of this study are that the included studies were not specifically designed to define growing pains. Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria 1. Pain Location Forty-five studies stated that growing pain are bilateral in nature, and 1 study stated that growing pains were usually unilateral. The remaining 99 studies did not specify bilateral or unilateral. Seventy-two studies stated that growing pains mainly affect the lower limbs or legs, and of these, 27 studies specifically mentioned the popliteal fossa and 13 the knees and shins.

Other locations mentioned were arms, shoulder, back, groin, or ligaments and tendons. Fifty-seven studies did not mention the location of growing pains. Forty studies stated that growing pains were not joint-related, and 3 claimed that they were. There were 102 studies that did not refer to joint involvement. Thirty-nine studies stated that growing pains were muscular, whereas 106 studies did not refer to muscular involvement. One diagnostic system specified bilateral, lower limb symptoms.
2. Age of Onset Twelve studies stated that growing pains occur between 3 and 12 years old, and most other studies reported within that same range with only 3 studies extending the age range to 13, 14, and 15 years old, respectively. 122 studies did not refer to the age of onset.
4.

Pain Trajectory Sixty-one studies stated that growing pains are episodic or recurrent, 21 stated that they are often persistent in nature, and 16 of these stated that a diagnosis of growing pains can only be made if the child or adolescent has pain for over 3 months. Seven studies specifically stated that growing pains are not persistent in nature.

### Growing pains in children [^114M4kGD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future studies

GP is very common and easy to diagnose once the typical clinical characteristics are presented.

The natural history is benign with disappearance of most attacks of pain by adolescence. However it is not clear whether some of these children develop symptoms of other non-inflammatory pain syndromes. It would be important to progressively follow the pain thresholds of children with GP and to correlate the findings with their symptoms. Long-term outcome studies are suggested to investigate whether the children with GP who has a lower pain threshold, are prone to develop other non-inflammatory pain syndromes in the musculoskeletal or other systems later in adolescence or adulthood. If many children with GP do develop non-inflammatory pain syndromes later in adolescence or adulthood, a trial of early intervention, with cognitive behavioral therapy for example, may prevent progression to other syndromes later in life.

Further studies into the pathogenesis of GP should be performed. Further larger and genetically homogenous studies are required to determine whether the statistically significant findings of decreased bone SOS in our series of children with GP have clinical implication

### Trajectories of pain in adolescents: a prospective cohort study [^114NLApM]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

This paper fills gaps in current research, and also raises questions for future studies. First, our data provide new information on trajectories of pain among adolescents. This elucidates how pain conditions develop among adolescents, and also raises questions of how this fits into the experience of pain throughout the lifecourse. The 'painful' trajectories may represent the beginning of a lifelong tendency to experience pain, although further long-term research is needed to verify this, and if so, whether the experience of frequent pain in adolescence represents the beginning of a long-term condition at that specific site, or whether it is an early indication of a more general tendency to experience pain. Second, this research adds to the literature on whether symptom-based conditions such as pain are separate diseases, or different manifestations of a single condition. We have described consistency in trajectories identified at different pain sites, and similarities in subject characteristics within those clusters, but these trajectories generally have different people within them. It is unclear from our findings why some adolescents report back pain, for example, while others report facial pain. Further research in these two areas would add to the body of knowledge on pain experience over time and throughout the life course.

We have identified clusters of adolescents with different trajectories of back pain, facial pain, headache and stomach pain over time. Subjects with high probability of pain throughout the study period were more often female and had worse psychological status, regardless of the pain site studied. The experience of a 'painful' trajectory is relatively common, and if these individuals can be identified clinically, targeted interventions aimed at modifying persistent pain may be appropriate. The similarity in trajectories and characteristics of the clusters identified for the four pain conditions has implications for research and potentially for clinical practice. For example, the same research questionnaires can be used to measure the impact of each of these conditions, and certain types of interventions could be standardised across the pain sites. These findings provide new and valuable information, using a large cohort, with frequent follow-up, and novel statistical analyses, on the course of pain among adolescents.

Table 1
Addressing the challenge of providing pain relief for infants and young children

Table 2
Demystifying childhood pain: key facts that need to be communicated to healthcare professionals and parents

A key feature of successful implementation is that high-quality information provision is not enough to change behaviour — people (be they parents or healthcare professionals) do not act on information alone; they need to be motivated, encouraged, and inspired to ensure that pain treatment is prioritised in busy healthcare settings and within the home environment. There are several factors, highlighted in Table 1, to explain why the treatment of pain in infants and young children is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we need to find ways to create greater awareness and engagement about the importance of alleviating pain in infants and young children. This should include the use of stories, art, and other media — in contrast, in the context of post-operative pain, the way in which multiple warning signs about the potential adverse effects of pain relief are presented in leaflets does not encourage the appropriate use of pain relief. Bringing childhood pain treatment to the top of the priority list requires novel and creative ways to engage with multiple stakeholders. For example, powerful infographics about the healthcare economic value of treating pain in young children should be shared with those responsible for resource allocation (e.g. healthcare leaders). Modern approaches (e.g. apps, social media platforms) provide benefits beyond printed material, but careful consideration of the audiences is required for bespoke information provision (e.g. appropriate language use, level of complexity and detail). Expertly produced materials using high-end communication strategies are required to promote these efforts. As an example, expert communication on hand-washing, which can lead to a reduction in transmission of germs, generated 75 million user videos on TikTok, with over 100 billion views in total. Similar high-quality communication and implementation strategies are needed to motivate healthcare professionals and parents to understand that pain caused by vaccination is unacceptable. There are excellent examples to follow, and consensus among healthcare providers has led to the successful introduction of pain-relieving strategies for vaccination. Simply encouraging parental contact and reassurance during vaccinations, using age-appropriate distraction techniques, or reframing the experience post-vaccination could have a profound impact on vaccine uptake, which in turn would reduce viral transmission. In the context of the current measles outbreak, in the UK and elsewhere, a small increase in the number of individuals vaccinated can have dramatic positive effects.

### Early childhood risk factors for later onset of pediatric chronic pain: a multi-method longitudinal study [^116g43qD]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain, pain frequency, and pain interference at age 11

At the age of 11 years, 1,019 children reported their pain frequency. Eighty percent of children (n = 818) self-reported experiencing pain and aches at least once a month, with 31% of children reporting having weekly or daily pain. Thirty-nine percent of children reported having chronic pain (i.e. pain lasting ≥ 3 months). Of these, children reported having muscle and joint pain (24%), headaches (22%), leg pain (21%), and abdominal pain (18%). Children, who endorsed having pain at least once per month, reported an average pain intensity level of 4.05/10 (SD = 1.65) and an average pain interference score of 48.94/74.00 (t- score; SD = 8.36), which is indicative of normal pain interference (i.e. when a child experiences pain, it does not stop them from participating in daily activities for a long period of time) Ten percent of youth (n = 81) reported severe levels of pain interference (i.e. t- scores ≥ 59), and 34% of youth endorsed moderate levels of pain interference (i.e. t -scores between 50 and 58).

### Pain assessment for children: overcoming challenges and optimizing care [^112ciu4e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that children have short- and long-term physical, physiological, and psychological effects due to untreated acute pain. Because the majority of children who seek care in an emergency department present with pain or experience pain during the evaluation and treatment in the emergency department, optimal assessment and treatment of pain are paramount for this population. This review will highlight the many complexities of the assessment of pain for the pediatric patient. In addition, a variety of factors that affect the self-report of pain in children will be identified. Optimizing the utility of a pain assessment remains a challenge for the health care provider in the emergency setting. The common goal of a decreased experience of pain for children through improved analgesic administration remains.

### Family and parent influences on pediatric chronic pain: a developmental perspective [^116MGwkJ]. The American Psychologist (2014). Low credibility.

Pain that recurs or persists is unfortunately a common experience for children. One of the unique considerations in pediatric chronic pain management is the bidirectional influences of children's pain experiences and parental and family factors. In this review we present a developmental perspective on understanding pediatric chronic pain and disability, highlighting factors relevant from infancy to adolescence, and family and parent influences. Preliminary evidence indicates that developmental processes are influenced and may also shape the pediatric pain experience. Parent emotions, behaviors, and health also play a role in children's pain experiences, where overly protective parent behaviors, increased distress, and history of chronic pain are important parent-level influences. Research on family-level influences has revealed that families of children with chronic pain have poorer family functioning (e.g., more conflict, less cohesion) than families of healthy children. Several important gaps exist in this research, such as in understanding basic developmental processes in children with chronic pain and how they influence children's perception of and responses to pain. Also, there is a lack of longitudinal data on family relationships and individual adjustment to allow for understanding of whether changes occur in parenting over the course of the child's chronic pain experience. Although parent interventions have been successfully incorporated into many cognitive-behavioral treatments for children with chronic pain conditions, little guidance exists for adapting intervention strategies to be developmentally appropriate. Additional research is needed to examine whether parent interventions are effective at different developmental stages and the best way to incorporate developmental goals into treatment.

### Growing pains in children [^113UxxKk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Family environment

Naish and Apley assumed that emotional disturbances are more common in children with GP, and that recurrent abdominal pain, headaches, and limb pains are a group of pain syndromes expressing a reactive pattern to familial emotional disturbances. Oster suggested that painful experiences during the parents' childhood are a precipitating factor for development of a pain syndrome among their children. In a study by Oberklaid et al, children with musculoskeletal pains (without the homogenous criteria of GP used for our studies) were often rated by their parents as having different temperamental and behavioral profiles than healthy normal controls, suggesting a psychosocial contribution to their pain, similar to that seen with other pain syndromes. In others studies, the family environment and psychological distress were also found to contribute to the development of musculoskeletal pain syndromes.

We evaluated the quality of life, depression, and anxiety levels of parents to children with GP and found that the depression levels of the parents were similar to those from other non-inflammatory pain syndromes, with mothers having increased depression levels. Parents of children with GP and children without pain had similar quality of life scores, not surprising considering the episodic nature of GP.

### The context matters: a retrospective analysis of life stage at chronic pain onset in relation to pain characteristics and psychosocial outcomes [^113Xcmsg]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a huge public health problem worldwide, affecting both sexes in all age-groups.–Although the majority of chronic pain sufferers are middle-aged,–developmental life stage at chronic pain onset varies, from childhood and early adolescence to late adulthood. In adults (18–60/65 years), up to 50% report chronic pain, while about 55% are affected in older populations (60/65+).–Also, prevalence among children and adolescents can be up to 88%, depending on pain location. As such, chronic pain debuts at different life stages in every pool of chronic pain patients, and the question is whether if and how time of onset is related to adaptation to pain.

Different life stages have their own developmental agendas, tasks, and expectations, as highlighted in the life-course view of aging. While no stage in the life course is considered more important than the other, earlier phases set the stage for later development, due to accumulation of risks.–Further, the illness-intrusiveness framework posits that contextual factors influence to what extent ill health interferes with lifestyle, tasks, and goals.–From these perspectives, the life stage at which ill health arises may be central for subsequent problem development. In chronic pain, this may be even more important, as pain in one area of the body induces a risk of future spread of pain to other areas. Moreover, research illuminating demographic factors, such as age and sex, has emphasized that these form the context for beliefs, expectancies, and ways of coping with pain. In other words, the developmental life stage when chronic pain emerges may be important for how it is experienced, its effect, and how it is managed. Still, little is known about the importance of pain onset in pain characteristics and outcomes.

While chronic pain has a detrimental impact on health and well-being, few studies have explored chronic pain from a life-course perspective. The life stage for chronic pain onset serves as a proxy for the developmental context in which pain begins to interfere with patients' lifestyle, tasks, and goals. As such, the aim of the current study was to apply a life-course perspective to chronic pain to enhance our understanding of variations in pain experiences and outcomes. The main research question was whether developmental life stage at chronic pain onset is related to pain characteristics and psychosocial outcomes (recovery expectancy, emotional distress, social functioning, general health functioning, life interference, and life control) in a large sample of chronic pain patients.

### Pain management in pediatric burn patients: review of recent literature and future directions [^114iDhEx]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Childhood burns are a profoundly traumatic and painful experience. Despite recognition of the prevalence of burn injuries in children and the severity of the associated pain, burn pain remains undertreated. At the same time, more evidence is emerging to suggest that undertreated pain has serious long-term medical and psychiatric consequences, many of which can be ameliorated with improved pain control. Pain in burn patients is, however, notoriously difficult to treat, perhaps because there is a chronic pain aspect underlying the acute pain that accompanies wound care and procedures. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that there are little data to guide decision making in these patients. This article aims to identify the best strategies to guide clinical practice through a review of the past 10 years' development in pediatric burn pain management. However, because clinical investigations remain limited in burned children, we also aim to draw attention to those areas where the data do not identify an optimal approach and further work is needed. Overall, in addition to just the traditional pharmacological approaches to pain, such as acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, and opioids, there is growing evidence to support more widespread use of regional anesthesia and novel technologies such as virtual reality. Starting with an improved understanding of the current state of the literature, we can identify areas of research and important questions whose answers will ultimately improve care and reduce suffering for this unfortunate population of children.

### Apophysitis and osteochondrosis: common causes of… [^115kQpw5]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Apophysitis Approximately one-third of school-aged children visit a health care professional each year for a sports injury. 2 Apophysitis is responsible for a large percentage of these visits. 3 The age of onset can vary, but apophysitis is notable during episodes of growth when bone lengthening outpaces lengthening of associated muscle tendon units. 4 Surgery is rarely needed for apophysitis. DIAGNOSIS The typical clinical diagnosis of apophysitis is based on history and examination. Sever Disease. Sever disease is the most common cause of heel pain in children and adolescents. 23 It occurs at the point of insertion of the Achilles tendon to the calcaneus and is often aggravated by running or jumping. 24 The incidence ranges from 2% to 16% in children. 24, 25 Onset is gradual and most common in eight- to 12-year-old children. 26 Risk factors include a tight heel cord, running or jumping sports, and early sport specialization.

26 Examination findings include tenderness at the heel when squeezed. Calcaneal radiographic results are usually negative but can be used to evaluate for rare stress fractures. FREIBERG DISEASE Freiberg disease is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the second digit of the metatarsal head, but it can affect the lesser toes as well. 31 Patients are usually affected from ages four to eight years. 32 Risk factors include short stature, hyperactivity, lower latitude of birth, obesity, low birth weight, and smoking exposure. 32 Symptoms and signs include groin pain, referred knee pain, a limp on the affected side, and internal rotation or shortening of the leg. PANNER DISEASE Osteochondrosis of the capitellum most often affects children younger than 10 years, and more than 90% are boys. 10 Figure 8 shows common locations of apophysitis and osteochondrosis.

1 Although rare, inflammatory arthropathies in children, especially in multiple joints, should be considered, and further evaluation and referral to a pediatric rheumatologist would be warranted. 10 Stress fractures should also be considered if no radiographic evidence of osteochondrosis is apparent and the pain does not localize to apophyseal centers. 10.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® back pain-child: 2024 update [^111ikCPa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic back pain is a common chief complaint encountered in the pediatric population. Although there are many etiologies for pediatric back pain, most cases are attributable to benign mechanical causes. Serious conditions causing back pain such as inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies are much less common but these pathologies can lead to long-term morbidity. Recent paradigm shift to judicious use of diagnostic imaging resources has come to the forefront. Although imaging is unlikely to be beneficial in transient back pain without neurologic deficit and normal physical examination, prompt imaging evaluation is required when there are clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology. For this document, various clinical scenarios are discussed by which a child may present with back pain. Imaging studies that might be most appropriate (based on the best available evidence or expert consensus) in these clinical scenarios are detailed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Treating perioperative anxiety and pain in children: a tailored and innovative approach [^112oyrjM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Millions of children undergo outpatient surgery in the United States each year; the overwhelming majority will experience significant perioperative anxiety and pain. Behavioral preparation programs focused on skills acquisition and modeling, considered essential for effective preparation, are no longer offered to most children and families in the outpatient surgery setting. Moreover, what little preparation does occur is typically generic in nature, rather than tailored to unique characteristics of the child and family. Untreated anxiety and pain have significant implications for children's short- and long-term recovery and future interactions in the medical environment. The rapid growth of the World Wide Web and increasing access to Internet by families across the country provide an opportunity to develop tailored, Web-based behavioral preparation programs that can be accessed repeatedly at times convenient to the child and family, that include coping skills training and modeling, and that can provide unique output based upon child and parent characteristics known to impact perioperative pain and anxiety. In this review article, we present a conceptual framework for a computer-based intervention that may transform the way we manage children and parents before and after surgery.

### Psychosocial perspectives in the treatment of pediatric chronic pain [^116FxoEd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Review

Background

It has been estimated that fifteen to thirty percent of children and adolescents experience chronic pain, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring slightly more commonly in girls than boys. Pain is considered a chronic condition when it has persisted for at least three months, moving beyond simple tissue damage (nociceptive) to subsequent changes within the peripheral and central nervous systems (neuropathic). The experience of chronic pain is also impacted by psychosocial factors (stress, negative affective states, family response, etc.) in addition to these biological factors. The most commonly reported locations of pain in children and adolescents are the head, stomach, arms and legs. The most common chronic pain conditions in children include migraine, recurrent abdominal pain, and general musculoskeletal pain. Symptoms of pediatric chronic pain can be severe and disabling, impairing the daily functioning of children and having an adverse impact on their families. Therefore, it is paramount that these chronic conditions be accurately assessed and treated in order to improve functioning and prevent long-term sequelae and deviation from a normal developmental trajectory.

### Recommendations for selection of self-report pain intensity measures in children and adolescents: a systematic review and quality assessment of measurement properties [^113sPGxq]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2006, PAIN published a systematic review of the measurement properties of self-report pain intensity measures in children and adolescents (Stinson JN, Kavanagh T, Yamada J, Gill N, Stevens B. Systematic review of the psychometric properties, interpretability and feasibility of self-report pain intensity measures for use in clinical trials in children and adolescents. PAIN 2006;125:143–57). Key developments in pediatric pain necessitate an update of this work, most notably growing use of the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS-11). Our aim was to review the measurement properties of single-item self-report pain intensity measures in children 3 to 18 years old. A secondary aim was to develop evidence-based recommendations for measurement of child and adolescent self-report of acute, postoperative, and chronic pain. Methodological quality and sufficiency of measurement properties for reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability was assessed by at least 2 investigators using COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). Searches identified 60 unique self-report measures, of which 8 (reported in 80 papers) met inclusion criteria. Well-established measures included the NRS-11, Color Analogue Scale (CAS), Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R; and original FPS), Pieces of Hurt, Oucher-Photographic and Numeric scales, Visual Analogue Scale, and Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (FACES). Quality of studies ranged from poor to excellent and generally reported sufficient criterion and construct validity, and responsiveness, with variable reliability. Content and cross-cultural validity were minimally assessed. Based on available evidence, the NRS-11, FPS-R, and CAS were strongly recommended for self-report of acute pain. Only weak recommendations could be made for self-report measures for postoperative and chronic pain. No measures were recommended for children younger than 6 years, identifying a need for further measurement refinement in this age range. Clinical practice and future research implications are discussed.

### Growing pains in children [^111NoEMB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A 6 year-old boy is awakened at 02:00 AM, screaming of painful legs. His parents appreciate severe pain, but do not see anything wrong with his legs. They rub his legs and give him acetaminophen and he returns to sleep with pain resolution within 30 minutes. In the morning he is running about as if nothing occurred at night. The following week he has a similar episode. This causes significant anxiety in the family, and they immediately visit the primary physician.

The family worries. What does he have? Is this a serious disease? A tumor?

What should the family physician do?

In this paper we will review the clinical presentation of this very common pain syndrome, try to understand current knowledge on the pathogenesis and natural course, what the family physician should do, especially in alleviating the family's anxiety.

Extremity pain is a common presenting complaint of visits to pediatricians. The most common cause of childhood musculoskeletal pain is termed "growing pains" (GP) that exemplifies a type of non-inflammatory pain syndrome. These pains are much more common than all other inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The prevalence of GP ranges from 3–37% of children. Oster found that as many as 15% of school-age children have occasional limb pain, and recently Evans and Scutter in a very large community study in Australia reported a prevalence of 37% in children aged 4–6 years. GP mainly affects children between the ages of 3–12 years.

GP has typical clinical characteristics; it is usually nonarticular, in 2/3 of children is located in the shins, calves, thighs or popliteal fossa and is almost always bilateral. The pain usually appears late in the day or is nocturnal, often awaking the child. The duration ranges from minutes to hours. The intensity can be mild or very severe. By morning the child is almost always pain free. There are no objective signs of inflammation on physical examination. GP is episodic, with pain-free intervals from days to months. In severe cases the pain can occur daily. In our series of 44 children with GP, 43% had frequency of at least once a week. Often parents can predict when the child will have pain on days of increased activity or when the child is more moody.

### Perspectives on the clinical significance of functional pain syndromes in children [^1129jGZa]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Functional pain syndromes (FPS) characterize a subset of individuals who experience pain and related symptoms and disability without clear structural or disease etiology. In the pediatric population, FPS hold high clinical importance due to significant prevalence rates and potential to persist into adulthood. Although extensive research has been executed to disambiguate FPS, the syndromes that fall within its spectrum remain conceptually complex and sometimes ill-defined. This paper provides an overview of available research on the classification and multifaceted etiology of FPS in youth and their effects on interpersonal, psychological, and familial function. Vital aspects of a successful multidisciplinary approach to treating this population are described; however, it is evident that future research requires more longitudinal studies.

### Pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: a review [^112Yqgad]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal pain is the most common reason for referral to pediatric rheumatologists. Causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain include a wide variety of inflammatory or non-inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, hypermobility, fibromyalgia, growing pains, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and more. Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMP) is a generic and descriptive term used to describe chronic pain syndromes of unconfirmed etiology, such as fibromyalgia and CRPS. In AMP, pain signals are amplified, thus mildly painful or non-painful stimuli are registered by the body as very painful, and this leads to a functional disability – as the patient tries to avoid the induction of pain.

In this review we will focus on the condition of pediatric chronic peripheral pain, more commonly referred to as pediatric complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Various nomenclature are used to describe this condition, including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), reflex sympathetic dystrophy, reflex neurovascular dystrophy, causalgia, and localized idiopathic pain. Matles was the first to describe a case of reflex sympathetic dystrophy in a child.

CRPS is a condition of chronic peripheral pain, usually of a distal extremity. This syndrome is characterized by spontaneous or stimuli-induced pain, which is amplified to a very high visual analog scale (VAS) score, disproportionate to the actual incident trauma/stimulus, in the presence of a wide variety of autonomic and motor disturbances. CPRS is divided into two types. CRPS type I, previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, usually develops after a preliminary event; usually minor a trauma or fracture, without any significant nerve injury. In contrast, CRPS type II, which is very rare in childhood, previously named causalgia, is induced by partial injury of a nerve or one of its major branches. This review summarizes the current information regarding the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of pediatric CRPS.

Epidemiology

Among the pediatric population (children under 18 years of age), CRPS type I is more common among girls. The mean age at diagnosis is around 12 years of age. The lower extremity is more commonly involved than the upper, with some reports stating a predilection towards involvement of the foot.

Information regarding the epidemiology of pediatric CRPS type II is wanting. There are case reports of CRPS type II among children as young as 3 years of age.

Currently, there are no data available regarding the incidence of pediatric CRPS.

### Experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis [^1126bNh7]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

Background

Life-limiting conditions are those for which there is no reasonable hope of cure and from which a child or young person will eventually die, for example, Batten disease or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Life-threatening conditions are those for which treatment may be feasible but can fail, for example, cancer or heart failure. From here on in, 'life-limiting condition' will refer to life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. Between 2001 and 2018 the prevalence of life-limiting conditions in children and young people in England increased from 26.7 per 10 000 to 63.2 per 10 000. Many of these children are dependent on medical technologies, such as ventilation, or gastrostomy feeds. Furthermore, they often require multiple medications either for the direct treatment of their condition or for pain and symptom management.

In most cases, parents provide this complex and extensive care for their child, often with limited external support. Parental caregiving encompasses a range of responsibilities, including managing personal, emotional and medical care, advocacy in education and healthcare settings, researching the condition and treatment in order to inform medical decision-making, organising instrumental daily activities such as communication and transport, as well as 'typical' parental responsibilities. Palliative care forms an essential part of the care that some of these children receive, often from the point of diagnosis.

Providing parents with support has long been recognised as being fundamental to paediatric palliative careand is well represented in guidelines for care professionals. The need for such is reflected in the growing body of research that focuses on the experiences and perspectives of parent caregivers. Existing studies focus largely on parental coping and quality of life, psychosocial outcomes, perceptions of and preferences for supportand lived experiences, predominantly in oncology settings. Reviews have sought a more comprehensive understanding of current knowledge surrounding parental experiences, leading to new insights and recommendations for practice.

### Low back pain [^113B8ouq]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain in children and adolescents — epidemiology and risk factors show substantial lifetime burden by late adolescence and sex-related risk differences. Prevalence rates are as high as 70% to 80% by 20 years of age, and one study found females had almost 3 times the risk of back pain as their male counterparts. Anthropometrics are not strongly associated with adolescent low back pain, findings for physical activity are mixed with certain sports associated, cross-sectional studies describe a U-shaped pattern with increased pain at sedentary and higher-activity ends, and psychological/psychosocial factors are commonly increased and may predict future onset.

Pain in children

Pain perception and prevalence in infants, children and adolescents

Pain transmission and reflex response in neonates, mediated by spinal cord and brainstem reflex pathways, have long been acknowledged. However, a true experience of pain includes emotional and affective components and requires higher-level cortical processing which was only demonstrated in the last 10–15 years.–

Owing to ongoing maturation of the central nervous system (CNS) and associated maturation of signal transmission and inhibitory pathways, pain perception in infants does, however, differ from children above the age of two and from adults.–Importantly, it has also been shown that opioid receptors are present from early on in fetal development,–and are responsive to exogenously administered morphine. In contrast to these early stages of development (preterm to 23 months old), no clinically significant differences in pain perception and mechanisms of analgesia are present between children (aged 2–11 years old) and adolescents (aged 12–17 years old), or between these two groups and adults. It is, however, acknowledged that gender may modify the pain experience, response to analgesic therapies and transition from acute to chronic pain.–

Acute pain in infants, children and adolescents is common and may be associated with a number of causes such as underlying disease (eg, acute painful episodes in cancerand sickle cell disease), trauma (eg, fractures or burns),–surgical interventions and hospital procedures.–Moderate or severe pain has been reported for 33–40% of all hospitalized children. Acute pain in this population is often not sufficiently managed, leading to many pediatric patients suffering from, often avoidable, moderate-to-severe pain.

### Five-year outcome of children with "growing pains": correlations with pain threshold [^116EXRLC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the 5-year outcome in a cohort of children with "growing pains" and the association with changes in pain threshold.

Study Design

Subjects were 44 children with growing pains studied previously, and controls were 38 pain-free children matched by sex and age. Current status of growing pains and other pain syndromes were assessed by parental questionnaires. Pain threshold was measured with a Fisher-type dolorimeter. Outcomes were correlated with the pain threshold.

Results

We examined 35/44 patients (80%) after 5 years. Eighteen patients (51%) experienced resolution of growing pains. In 14 of the 17 patients with persistent growing pains (83%), episodes were less frequent and milder. The prevalence of accompanying pain syndromes decreased from 20% to 14%. No patient developed fibromyalgia. Pain thresholds were similar in the entire growing pains cohort and healthy controls, but those with continued growing pains had significantly lower thresholds than controls (P < .05) and patients with resolved growing pains (P < .02).

Conclusions

We confirm that growing pains has a benign prognosis and probably represents a pain amplification syndrome of early childhood.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^114V4zw9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Back pain is common in children and adolescents. Most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. In children and adolescents, pain is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Serious pathology, including malignancy and infection needs to be excluded. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the immature skeleton. Diagnostic imaging is useful in the evaluation of a child or adolescent with low back pain and can help guide management. This article will review common causes of back pain in the pediatric population.

### Opioids for chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents [^115FJ9vZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as importantWe designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol as priority areas) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions in children and adolescents. As the leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications: nociceptive, neuropathic, idiopathic, visceral, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, and other unknown reasons. Opioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. They bind to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (mu, kappa, delta, and sigma) and can be agonists, antagonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, or partial agonists. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most high-income countries, but access may be restricted in low- and middle-income countries. For example, opioids currently available in the UK include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are used in varying doses (generally based on body weight for paediatric patients) by means of parenteral, transmucosal, transdermal, or oral administration (immediate release or modified release). To achieve adequate pain relief in children using opioids, with an acceptable grade of adverse effects, the recommended method is a lower dose gradually titrated to effect in the child.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of opioids used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, comparing opioids with placebo or an active comparator.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and planned to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

No studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low. We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels due to the lack of data reported for any outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. We are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. We know from adult randomised controlled trials that some opioids, such as morphine and codeine, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions. This means that no conclusions could be made about efficacy or harm in the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.

### Growing pains: a study of 30 cases and a review of the literature [^112r6SwP]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Data from the literature regarding the clinical profile of growing pains are limited. The purpose of this study was to define the clinical features, familial history, laboratory findings, and therapeutic outcome of growing pains in children.

Methods

Thirty children (18 male and 12 female; 3 to 14 y of age) who presented with growing pains between January 2006 and December 2007 were enrolled and prospectively followed up for 1 year. The inclusion criterion was lower extremity pain, which was recurrent and lasted for > 3 months. The exclusion criteria were any abnormal systemic or local symptoms and signs, joint involvement, and limp or limitation of activity. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum calcium and phosphorus levels, were performed in all children.

Results

The study group had pain during the night and afternoon in 43.3% and 56.7% of cases, respectively. Both lower limbs were involved in 80% of cases, causing awakening and crying episodes in 40% and 37% of cases, respectively. The frequency of pain was as follows: daily, 5%; weekly, 45%; monthly, 35%; and every 3 months, 15%. The pains were relieved by massaging the affected site in 95% of cases and by analgesics in 5% of children. A family history of growing pains was positive in 20% of patients. All patients had laboratory tests within normal values.

Conclusion

Growing pain is a frequent noninflammatory syndrome consisting of intermittent, often annoying, pains that affect the lower extremities of children. Clinical diagnosis is easy if precise inclusion and exclusion criteria in the history and physical examinations are strictly followed. Patients and family reassurance is mandatory.

Level Of Evidence

This is a Level I prospective study.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^115nAF2W]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients — optimal care for infants and children (including adolescents) requires special attention to the biopsychosocial nature of pain, with developmental differences in their experience and expression of pain and suffering and their response to analgesic pharmacotherapy; caregivers in both the home and hospital may have misperceptions regarding the importance of analgesia as well as its risks and benefits, may assume pain is not present and defer treatment in the absence of a clear source or obvious pain behavior, and safe methods for providing analgesia are underused for fear of opioid-induced respiratory depression; many techniques are the same as for adults, although some (e.g., caudal analgesia) are more commonly used in children; the Task Force believes pediatric patients require special considerations to ensure optimal perioperative analgesia, and the ASA members and consultants strongly agree that perioperative care for children undergoing painful procedures or surgery requires developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy.

### Perspectives on the clinical significance of functional pain syndromes in children [^116HuwF3]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Functional pain syndromes (FPS) are a diagnostic group of conditions that remain loosely defined. Pain is often a warning signal from the body indicating an abnormality in structure or function. However, there is a subset of patients who experience pain and are subject to symptoms, suffering, and disability with unclear disease etiology or biomechanical cause. Many patients who experience FPS also experience clusters of symptoms that can affect a wide array of systems, often due to a combination of varying physiological, affective, and cognitive influences. As a result, physicians have the difficult task of labeling a cluster of symptoms that do not neatly fit into a disease-driven diagnostic category and implementing a treatment plan that at times relies on speculation. This is due to several reasons: 1) these diseases often present with a wide variety of symptoms and so the diagnostic criteria are vague and constantly under revision;–2) these diseases arise from a complex mix of biological, psychological, and interpersonal factors;–and 3) these diseases often share similarities with each other and it can be difficult to make a definitive distinction, and frequently co-occur, making definitive distinction difficult. As a result, these diseases can often be misdiagnosed, especially in a pediatric population.

An investigation conducted by the Pain of Unknown Origin in Children Study Group one decade ago supports this premise. The study assembled a panel of 17 Dutch pediatricians who work in psychosomatic medicine and presented them with the medical reports and standardized psychiatric assessment of 134 children who had FPS for more than 3 months. All the participating pediatricians were asked to use the information to diagnose the children, with a consensus being defined as agreement among more than 80% of the pediatricians. Consensus for the underlying cause was only found for 47% of the cases, and consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach was reached for 63% of the cases. Further work needs to be done on developing a diagnostic procedure that is reliable and encompasses most if not all FPS.

### The prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents: a systematic review update and meta-analysis [^115raNMG]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, there has been a substantial effort towards improving the diagnosis and management of pediatric pain. In a 2020 Lancet Commission on children's pain, which involved individuals with lived experiences, 4 transformative goals were proposed: make pain matter, make pain understood, make pain visible, and make pain better. According to the Lancet Commission, if achieved, the goals will transform the lives of children with pain and their families. In 2020, the World Health Organization released a guideline on the physical, psychological, and pharmacological interventions for the management of primary and secondary chronic pain in children aged 0 to 19 years. In addition, chronic primary pain was recognized as a primary pain type in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in 2019. Chronic primary pain is defined as "pain in 1 or more anatomic regions that persists or recurs for longer than 3 months and is associated with significant emotional distress or significant functional disability (interference with activities of daily life and participation in social roles) and that cannot be better explained by another chronic pain condition". (p.1004) Chronic secondary pain is pain that is associated with another condition, such as chronic cancer pain, chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic headache and orofacial pain, chronic visceral pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, there remains a need for a pediatric emphasis as the current criteria are focused on adults, and thus might not be relevant for children and adolescents. To reach the Lancet Commission goals, combined with the exponential growth in pediatric pain literature over the past few decades, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the overall prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents worldwide is essential. This knowledge is essential to facilitate early diagnosis and improve treatment, ultimately reducing the impact that chronic pain has on the lives of children, adolescents, their families, and society.

### Are psychotropic medications effective in chronic pain management in children and adolescents? A meta-analysis of randomized control trials [^114hd6v1]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric chronic pain is a notable health problem with a prevalence rate of 20% to 35% in children and adolescents. Pediatric pain is not only common but also under-recognized and, consequently, under-treated. Overall, more than 10% of all hospitalized children experience chronic pain. Data indicate that female patients report more pain than male patients, and the incidence peaks at an average age of 14 years. Perquin et al 2000 described headache as the most common pediatric complaint at 23%, followed by abdominal pain (22%) and limb pain (22%). Older children report pain more frequently than younger children. 8% of school-aged children reported chronic pain. Chronic pain affects multiple aspects of the patient and their family's lives. In a more recent study, Roth-Isigkeit et al 2004 reported that 3.5% of children experience daily pain.

A large proportion of children and adolescents report disability and distress associated with chronic pain. They also describe limitations with participation in daily activities of childhood, including school, play, and sleep. Anxiety frequently accompanies chronic pain. A characteristic pattern of disability associated with chronic pain includes co-morbid depression and maladaptive coping, which are more notable in younger age groups. Family dynamics and functioning are often adversely affected when children are dealing with chronic pain issues, with parents and siblings reporting significant distress. Jordan et al 2007 found that these parents experience high levels of anxiety and depression, which in turn may create a vicious circle resulting in early onset depression in children. A cost-of-illness study in the United Kingdom found the overall annual cost to a household containing a child living with idiopathic chronic pain was three times higher than the average cost of living for a family.

Chronic pain in children can be managed with both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Pharmacologically, pediatric chronic pain is typically treated with medications such as NSAIDs, opioids, and psychotropic medications. It is essential to consider the effectiveness and value of pharmacological interventions as stand-alone treatment regimens and as components integrated within a therapeutic approach that better guides care. Preliminary evidence suggests that even for children and adolescents with severe pain and disability, it is possible to reduce the impact of pain on their lives and that on their families. Our objective is to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents with chronic pain condition.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^116iFhR2]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A call to action

This article highlights that with adequate information and motivation to act, families and healthcare professionals can advocate for appropriate pain relief in children (Fig. 1). Importantly, while needle-related pain is an archetypal example of pain under-treatment, the value, relevance, and direct transferability of using similar approaches to manage other types of pain in children, such as everyday pains or post-operative pain, is clear. To improve pain treatment in infants and young children, we need to focus on information (understanding treatment options and expectations), emotion (motivation to treat), and advocacy for the child. These can be most effectively delivered through prioritising key 'moments that matter', such as children's early life experiences of iatrogenic pain, so that their future expectations about pain relief are appropriately formed and shaped.

A wide variety of communication channels are needed to maximise change, including high-quality information from trusted sources, social media campaigns to increase awareness, education for healthcare professionals, and more. The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health Commission on Delivering transformative action in paediatric pain sets out four goals as a call to action: make pain matter, make pain understood, make pain visible, and make pain better. We need a national conversation on how to achieve these goals, which will require the engagement of healthcare professionals, parents, charities, and industry to make this vision a reality. It is within our grasp to promise to do everything possible to prevent and treat pain caused by vaccinations in every child, every time — let us do it.

### Complex pain in young children [^115VuN3x]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Early childhood is a time of rapid development, particularly of the central nervous system, and can set a foundation for the entire life course. Complex pain in young children can impact the quality of life through limiting physical and social development, compromising psychological well-being, and disrupting sleep. The aim of this review is to identify the needs of young children who present to a tertiary-level pain service, what services they require, and their treatment outcomes. There are limited data on this vulnerable population, which may be due to small numbers represented and the complexities of pain assessment in this age group.

Methods

A retrospective chart review recorded demographics, gender, pain location and etiology, treatment, and outcomes of 28 children younger than age eight years attending a pediatric pain clinic over a three-year period.

Results

All but two young children had an obvious physical pathology as an explanation for pain; this is in contrast to studies of pain clinics servicing adolescents. A diverse range of conditions, some rare, were identified, requiring a high level of pediatric understanding of the disease process and an ability to work with primary teams with expertise in disease-modifying strategies.

3. Results

A summary of studies identified, screened, and included is shown in the Figure 1 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). We screened 7471 titles, 464 abstracts, and 302 full texts, including 189 reports of 177 studies (listed in supplementary material).

Figure 1.
PRISMA flow diagram. Flow diagram showing studies identified, screened, and included in the review. PRISMA, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

We classified reports as: (1) acute (45 reports), for example, blunt trauma, procedural pain, surgical pain, hospital admissions or (2) chronic/persistent (142 reports), for example, unexplained chronic, arthritis, cerebral palsy, sickle cell, dysmenorrhea (recognising the overlap and ambiguity of this classification). Two studies included both acute and chronic pain. Classifications are listed in the supplementary material. Studies spanned 30 years (1993–2023) with 121 (64%) published in the last 10 years, 57 between 2004 and 2013 (30%), and 11 (6%) before 2004. Twenty five percent of 177 unique studies included 4 to 10 participants; 43% included 11 to 20; 26% included 21 to 50, and 6% included more than 51. Almost all (93%) were set-in high-income countries. The global coverage of studies included is illustrated in Figure 2. Studies incorporated the experiences of 5875 young people. Participants across studies ranged in age from 2 to 38 years, with each study including a different age range. One Ghanaian study of high school and undergraduates (2 reports) included a single person aged 38 years. The large majority (93%) of the 177 unique studies included children and adolescents between the age of 11 and 20 years old. The most common age groups represented were 16 to 20 years and 11 to 15 years (Fig. 3). Descriptive details are provided in the supplementary material. Twenty-two studies, focusing on adolescent experiences and/or transition to adult care, included participants over the age of 24. We report 6 themes that help us to understand what it is like to experience pain as you grow up (Table 2). Each theme was supported by data from acute and chronic studies and by studies across age groups.

### Pediatric pain management: the multidisciplinary approach [^1165KwV2]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

The intensive multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation approach is based on the biopsychosocial model of pain, which accounts for the complex interplay of the biological, psychological, individual, social, and environmental factors that contribute to and maintain chronic pain symptoms and subsequent disability. Initially created for adult pain patients, these programs have been found to be as cost effective, if not more so, than other medical treatments, and have the added benefit of better outcomes for medication use, health care utilization, functional activities, return to work, and closure of disability claims.

This treatment model has begun to gain international favor in the world of pediatrics. In fact, several countries in Europe and certain areas of the United States have begun to mandate that chronic pain be treated with a multidisciplinary approach. However, relatively few of these treatment centers exist worldwide when compared to increasing identification of children suffering from chronic pain. Multidisciplinary centers have large areas of catchment, and families sometimes have to drive long distances to have their child evaluated or treated in one of these centers.

This article pursues three main objectives aimed at familiarizing the reader with the multidisciplinary approach to complex pediatric chronic pain conditions. First, we review the experience of chronic pain and associated disability in children and adolescents. Second, we describe existing models of multidisciplinary pediatric pain programs and their effectiveness, focusing specifically on intensive multidisciplinary pediatric pain programs. Finally, we make recommendations for further areas of clinical development and study.

### Characteristics of highly impaired children with severe chronic pain: a 5-year retrospective study on 2249 pediatric pain patients [^1114m7Fo]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is a frequent problem not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. Epidemiological studies have played an important role in outlining the prevalence and impact of pediatric chronic pain in the general population ‐ with rates of a 3-month prevalence ranging between 25% and 46%.

These large epidemiology based studies often define chronic pain solely on the duration of pain, usually > 3 months, and have also been hampered by assigning diagnoses according to self-report or pain description in questionnaires. In children with clinically significant impairment from chronic pain, results from these epidemiological studies have limited applicability as they primarily report on the symptom of chronic pain, which may not necessarily cause impairment and, even require treatment. A study in school children has shown that symptoms in many cases resolve spontaneously without treatment and are not necessarily associated with disability, distress and illness beliefs. These features are specific to clinically relevant chronic pain, elevating it into the realm of a chronic disease. Second, epidemiological studies include a very small number of highly impaired children. The study by Huguet and Miro investigated a school sample of 561 children with 37% of the children classified as experiencing chronic pain. However, only 1% (n = 6) actually reported a high pain-related disability. Finally, children from epidemiological studies are often recruited in schools ‐, but children with a high level of impairment from chronic pain miss a significant amount of school making it entirely possible they would be underrepresented in epidemiological school samples.

Due to these restrictions, results of epidemiological studies cannot be readily generalized to children suffering significant impairment from chronic pain and who are in need of treatment.

Published pediatric clinical studies, on the other hand, have had very small sample sizes or focused on specific pain problems or age groups ‐. Until now, there has not been a description of a large patient sample with well-defined chronic pain conditions classified according to diagnostic criteria with a high level of impairment requiring tertiary pain treatment. More information on the characteristics of these children has the potential to inform treatment conceptualization and implementation of tertiary treatment programs. It is also known that health care structures for specialized treatment in highly impaired children with chronic pain are scarce. A study on the services offered by multidisciplinary pain treatment facilities for children and adolescents with chronic pain across Canada demonstrated the discrepancy between services offered and needed with the result being limited access for children in need of treatment. By improving specialized treatment and access to this treatment poor developmental and functional outcomes may be prevented.

### Neuropathic pain in children [^115jko2w]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NP), due to a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, is not well documented or researched in children. NP is a clinical diagnosis that can be difficult, especially in younger children. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise NP, as pain mechanisms and consequently management and prognosis differ from other types of long-term pain. NP is common in adult pain clinics but many of the underlying disease states in which it occurs are infrequently or never encountered in paediatric practice. However, NP in childhood has been reported, even in the very young in certain clinical situations. Causes of NP include traumatic injury, complex regional pain syndrome type II, cancer and chemotherapy, chronic infection, neurological and metabolic disease, and inherited sensory nerve dysfunction. The clinical and laboratory study of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has revealed important age-related differences in clinical presentation and prognosis. It is clear that mechanisms operating during development can profoundly modify the consequences of nerve damage and NP. Clinically, diagnosis, assessment and treatment of NP are based on methods and evidence derived from data in adults. Improvements in the understanding and management of NP are likely to come from developmentally appropriate improvements in the clarity and consistency of diagnosis and systematic, well-researched approaches to treatment.

### Latest developments in the assessment and management of chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes in children [^117RgGot]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As many as 25% of new patients in pediatric rheumatology clinics present with idiopathic chronic pain and recent data suggest the prevalence of these conditions is increasing. Knowledge of the latest developments in assessment and treatment is critical for providing optimal clinical care. This review summarizes advances published in the past year forwarding our understanding of chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes in children.

Recent Findings

Research has recently focused on the impairment associated with chronic pain syndromes in children, issues impacting the diagnosis of these conditions, and the efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. No diagnostic criteria have been developed for specific chronic pain syndromes in children; however, data from several studies substantiate the need for thorough assessment of the child and family in multiple domains. In addition, studies have expanded both pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment options for children with these syndromes.

Summary

Despite a growing body of research on chronic pain syndromes in children, there are no established standards of care. Data continues to support an interdisciplinary approach for effectively assessing and managing these conditions.

Key Messages

Infants and children of all age-groups, including (preterm) neonates and young infants can perceive pain.
Acute pain in infants and children is common and frequently undertreated.
Untreated pain in infants and children may have long-term consequences in terms of adverse cognitive, motor and behavioral outcomes.
Only very few analgesics are labelled for neonates and very young infants.
Off-label use is common and associated with a risk of lack of efficacy and/or safety issues.

### Reducing pain in children with cancer: methodology for the development of a clinical practice guideline [^115Jq8Ed]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pain in children with cancer has been well acknowledged and puts great burden on patients and their families. For this reason, providing age‐appropriate pain assessments and treatment strategies to reduce is a priority. Pain in children treated for cancer can have multiple origins, such as the tumor itself (e.g. pain associated with bone metastases), adverse effects of anticancer treatment (e.g. chemotherapy‐induced neuropathic pain), or painful and distressing procedures that children with cancer undergo frequently (e.g. accessing a central venous access port).

Even though reducing pain has been acknowledged as being of utmost importance, there is no uniform guideline that advises on assessment and management of pain in children with cancer. This is unfortunate, as high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, also called clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), have been shown repeatedly to improve patient outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines include a systematic review of evidence, thus providing clinicians with an overview of the current best available evidence. Recommendations are then based upon the evidence and formulated by a representative multidisciplinary panel including professionals and patient representatives. Justifications and subgroup considerations are included to provide insight as to why specific treatments should or should not be provided and to which patients. In addition, by summarizing the available evidence research gaps are identified that help in composing and prioritizing a research agenda.

We know that children experience pain as one of the most bothersome symptoms of cancer and its treatment, and parents even designated pain as the most problematic are for their child undergoing cancer treatment. With the current lack of evidence‐based guidance in this area, and the existing large variations in daily practice, a CPG could be pivotal to improve pain outcomes and quality of life.

We therefore initiated the development of a comprehensive CPG regarding pain in children with cancer. Our aim was to formulate recommendations for care for children with cancer regarding assessment and management of pain. In this article, we provide an overview of our methodology, and briefly present the identified evidence. Subsequent manuscripts will focus on the recommendations, reporting on (1) pain assessment, (2) management of procedure‐related pain, and (3) management of tumor‐ and toxicity‐related pain.

### Pain trajectories and well-being in children and young people with cerebral palsy: a cohort study [^111cQQBu]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent, non‐progressive disorder affecting movement and posture due to disturbances in the developing fetal or infant brain. Despite the growing recognition of CP‐related pain, little is known about the trajectories of pain in children/young people with CP and their impact on well‐being. Increased understanding could enable pain patterns to be identified, treatments targeted, pain chronicity minimized, and well‐being enhanced.

Pain has been defined as 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage'. Pain is one of the most commonly reported comorbidities in both children and adults with CP. In a recent systematic review of children and young adults, the reported prevalence of pain varied greatly, depending on the study, from 14% (any pain in the preceding month) to 76% (current pain using an observational/behavioural scale). Research has also identified that 25% of children with CP have moderate‐to‐severe chronic pain restricting daily activities.

Evidence suggests there may be pain patterns experienced throughout childhood. In children with CP aged 3 to 16 years reporting pain at two visits, 26% had no pain, 20% had stable pain, and 21% had improved pain levels, while pain worsened in 33%. In a longitudinal study, Colver et al.also found that pain intensity increased from childhood to adolescence. Some individuals also experience significant long‐term decreases in pain after procedures such as insertion of intrathecal baclofen pumps. Pain management in CP is challenging given the clinical heterogeneity of this population. The underlying aetiology, as well as access to and success of pain treatments, may ultimately influence short‐ and long‐term pain trajectories.

To our knowledge, no previous studies have prospectively identified pain trajectories and their impact on the well‐being and quality of life of children/young people with CP. Past work identified an association between pain and quality of life. Pain was associated with lower physical, psychological, and social well‐being in children and adolescents. However, this study included only one follow‐up period and pain trajectories were not identified. Another study found that pain was associated with health‐related quality of life in children aged 3 to 19 years, with musculoskeletal deformity being the most important negative factor.

### The lived experience of chronic pain and dyskinesia in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy [^116U9rhu]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Accessing the voice of children and adolescents with CP who can self-report is a critical source of non-biased information about pain perceptions and experiences within a demographic where proxy pain reporting is often typical. While some children with limited cognitive capacity remain dependent on proxy pain reports, others may develop the capacity to self-report with increasing age, education, therapeutic interventions, and access to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Increasing access to AAC means that many children with dyskinetic CP are capable of self-reporting despite high levels of motor and speech impairment. A recent Australian cohort study reflected the unique physical context of children with predominant dyskinetic CP. In that study 55% of study participants were able to effectively communicate, while 70% had severe motor impairment and 71% had speech that was either unclear, not usually understandable, or not understandable at all. Despite growing ability to access AAC in this population, pain communication remains complex. Pain communication is a process that relies on observers (e.g. parent, clinician, school teacher) understanding the feelings, thoughts, and expressions of the child experiencing pain and for that observer to respond appropriately. This interactive process is particularly complicated for those reliant on AAC, where reliability and effectiveness of their pain communication may alter with different observers, levels of pain severity, fatigue, types of AAC, and use of communication partners. A communication partner describes a person who acts as an intermediary between an AAC user and an observer less familiar with a particular communication mode or strategy. Communication partners are proposed to help AAC users share perspectives by enhancing clarity and efficiency of their communication, noted to be of particular benefit in medical settings where communication barriers are identified to exist (e.g. time constraints, health professional skills). The unique physical context of children with dyskinetic CP is likely to complicate pain management, making them vulnerable to not having their voices heard and an important group to learn more from their experiences.

The objective of this mixed methods study was to explore the lived experiences of chronic pain and dyskinesia through the unbiased lens of children and adolescents with CP able to communicate experiences by either verbalizing or using AAC.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^113s1iz7]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric pain assessment tools — Children have unique age and developmental aspects as they recognize, interpret, and respond to pain, and infants and young children are unable to communicate their pain experience, making recognition and assessment of pain difficult. Pain presence is suggested in preverbal children by excessive crying, irritability, poor feeding, position and movement of the arms and legs, sleep disturbance, and altered facial expression. Pain assessment tools generally focus on physiological and behavioral reactions and may therefore reflect stress not otherwise associated with pain, and the complex health care environment in itself may be anxiety-provoking.

### Growing pains in children [^116rhjwQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Low pain threshold

GP belong to the non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Non-inflammatory pain syndromes, especially fibromyalgia, are associated with a lower pain threshold and with more characteristic tender points when measured by dolorimeter as compared to people without pain syndromes. In fibromyalgia lower pain threshold and characteristic tender points are a dominant feature, which is found in the acute stage of the syndrome and resolves following remission.

Since GP is also a pain syndrome, our hypothesis was that the pain threshold in children with GP is lower compared to controls. We assessed the pain threshold by dolorimeter in 44 children with GP and indeed found that children with GP have a decreased pain threshold compared to age and gender matched controls. It was interesting to note that the pain threshold at the anterior tibia was the highest in the body, including among children with GP. This is the region most commonly reported by children with GP as painful during attacks. This indicated that GP represents a generalized pain syndrome, not only a localized disorder. Thus it is possible that GP represents the pattern of non-inflammatory pain syndromes in early childhood.

### Pediatric chronic pain: biopsychosocial assessment and formulation [^1145Lwo5]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pain in children is an increasingly recognized clinical problem with alarmingly high prevalence rates found in some populations. Although it is not understood why some children experience high levels of pain, the subjective experience of chronic pain (including its site, intensity, quality, unpleasantness, and associated suffering) has long been believed to result from interactions between multiple contributors, including nociceptive, affective, sociocultural, behavioral, and cognitive. Regardless of whether the antecedent of chronic pain is known or unknown, similar patterns of symptoms, behaviors, and disability are often seen. Historically, however, there has been an unhelpful tendency to dichotomize chronic pain as either physical or functional in origin. However, recent studies strongly support a biopsychosocial basis to all pain, revealing its sensory emotional nature by showing that large distributed neural networks are accessed during nociceptive processing. The development and maintenance of chronic pain involve long-term changes in multiple integrated peripheral, spinal, and brain regions interacting in a complex way to shape the individual's experience. Hence, chronic pain from any cause cannot be viewed as a purely physical or psychological phenomenon, nor should it be expected that a unimodal approach to treatment will succeed. It follows that when assessing children and young people with chronic pain, information on a wide range of developmentally relevant dimensions, conveniently classified as biological, psychological, and sociocultural, should be gathered to formulate the potential causes, contributors, and effects of pain to devise an appropriate multimodal management plan.

### The prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents: a systematic review update and meta-analysis [^115KwqK8]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

2. Methods

This systematic review follows an a priori published protocol. In keeping with best practices in patient-oriented research, this review was designed and conducted in collaboration with a patient partner and coauthor (J.M.).

2.1. Inclusion criteria

2.1.1. Population

This review considered studies that included population-based samples of children and/or adolescents aged ≤ 19 years. This cutoff follows the World Health Organization definition of adolescent, which is ages 10 to 19 years. Studies that used a non-population-based sampling approach were excluded. Studies that reported on participants beyond 20 years of age were excluded, unless estimates for younger age groups were able to be calculated separately. No limitations were placed based on geography. Studies that reported on the prevalence of chronic pain in specific subpopulations, such as children and adolescents with chronic illnesses (eg, cancer, arthritis) or other health conditions (eg, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy), were excluded.

2.1.2. Condition

This review sought to summarize existing evidence on the prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents. In the protocol, chronic pain was defined as "pain with a minimum duration of at least 3 months or pain that is described as chronic, persistent, or recurrent". For further clarity, the final definition of chronic pain used in this review was as follows: (1) pain with a minimum duration of at least 3 months; or (2) pain that is described as chronic, persistent, or recurrent with no timeframe reported. If a study included pain measured over a time frame of less than 3 months (eg, participants were asked about recurrent pain over the past 2 months), these were excluded as non-chronic pain. In addition, if a study did not separate chronic pain data from other diagnoses, it was excluded (eg, studies that reported on diagnosis of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders using the ROME criteriabut did not separately report on the overall abdominal pain subtype were excluded).

### Common lower extremity injuries in the skeletally immature athlete [^1118QYEG]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2010). Low credibility.

Lower extremity musculoskeletal pain is a common complaint in the adolescent athlete. During rapid growth, several common biomechanical changes occur that may predispose to overuse injury. Unlike fractures, most of these office-based sports medicine complaints are initially evaluated by the primary care provider. This review discusses several of the most common complaints and briefly discusses some clinically significant conditions that masquerade as common injuries. The article discusses only the injuries unique to the growing athlete. The article's goal is to help develop a framework for the pediatric clinician to evaluate common complaints and formulate a plan that includes simple stretches and physical therapy recommendations.

### Growing pains in children [^116FvPYZ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Bone strength

Since GP usually occurs late in the day and is often reported on days of increased activity, GP may represent a relative local overuse (stress) syndrome, and may be associated with decreased bone strength. In evaluating this theory we measured the bone speed of sound by ultrasound in 39 children with GP. We found that the bone strength density of children with GP was significantly less than values for population norms of healthy children, especially in the painful tibia region.

Thus GP may represent a local lower extremity overuse syndrome with bone fatigue in children with low pain thresholds. These children may experience more pain after physical activity. However while relative overuse can help explain late day pains, this theory cannot explain all features of GP such as the abrupt nocturnal episodes of pain, or pain in the upper extremity in some patients.

### The experience of chronic pain among adolescents: suffering and attempt to overcome pain? [^114ksAFx]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been a large number of publications and investigations on pediatric chronic pain. In addition to many publications on chronic pain in the pediatric population between 2000 and 2022, there are also a number of texts dedicated to pediatric chronic pain. These studies depicted that pain has dramatic effects on adolescents and their families. CADs with CP have frequent absences from school, miss social activities, and experience sleep disorders, low satisfaction with life and overall well-being, emotional problems and other physical problems later in life.

Decreasing the prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents demands to increase efforts in a better understanding of children's pain experience and how they deal with it. Effective implementation of this knowledge translation entails a strong basis of evidence and a positive context where evidence is implemented (e.g. culture). Nonetheless, the top most existing articles consisted of randomized controlled trials and epidemiological studies, especially in acute pain; therefore, a paradigm shift to paying attention to prolonged and persistent pain is essential. Meanwhile, since previous personal experiences of pain, cognitive awareness, cultural and educational factors, developmental conditions, and pain characteristics may make pain experience unique to each person, qualitative research should be considered to better understand the experiences of youth with chronic pain.

Hence, there isn't much qualitative research, and most of them are on an ethnically and culturally narrow sample (i.e. European and North American, generally Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic countries). One of the studies in this area reported that the three main themes of adolescents' concerns about CP were worry ripple, pain mystery, and avoidance from conundrum. That study mainly focused on fears and concerns and did not address other aspects of CP experience among adolescents. Another study qualitatively explored pain management and attitudes towards using over-the-counter analgesics among adolescents with CP and reported that they considered CP unmanageable and unavoidable. That study also did not provide in-depth data about the different aspects of adolescents' experiences of CP. Moreover, a study into the development of a web- and mobile-based self-management program reported that there were limited data about the CP-related cognitive and emotional experiences of adolescents with CP. In other qualitative studies adolescents describe pain as interrupting their ability to be "normal" and making them feel different from their healthy friends, while medical providers, school personnel, peers and even family members enact pain-related stigma toward adolescents.

### Growing pains in children [^112P49fr]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Investigations and diagnosis

Currently, the diagnosis is based only on typical clinical symptoms as outlined above. There are no sensitive or specific laboratory tests, although children often undergo extensive investigations for other diseases. At least 19% of the children with GP undergo bone scans for evaluation of their pain. When patients have typical clinical characteristics there is no need to do any laboratory or imaging tests. However, if the symptoms are atypical, the diagnosis of GP should not be assumed without evaluating other causes.

### The spectrum of pediatric amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome [^113pXbX9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The purposes of this study are 1) to further define the presenting characteristics of children with chronic non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain to a pediatric rheumatology academic center and 2) determine whether there are significant differences in presenting manifestations, especially in those who fulfill the criteria for fibromyalgia, those with more limited areas of pain versus those with diffuse pain, and those with intermittent pain versus constant pain. First, we hypothesized that children with diffuse pain would generally fulfill adult criteria for fibromyalgia, be more functionally disabled and experience a longer duration of pain than those with limited pain. Second, we hypothesized children with limited pain would manifest more transient autonomic changes, a forme fruste of CRPS. Third, we hypothesized that children with intermittent pain would typically be those with more limited pain, would have a higher level of function, and would have a longer duration of pain than those with constant pain since they are frequently pain free when seen and are not well described in the literature. Insights gained from addressing these aims may improve the diagnosis and treatment of children with chronic musculoskeletal pain, thereby mitigating the associated excessive socioeconomic and psychological costs.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer-related pain in children and adolescents [^114BsvWA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for pharmacological treatments for persisting pain in children acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. Views on children's pain have changed over time and relief of pain is now seen as important. In the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, and it was assumed that children quickly forgot about painful experiences. We designed a suite of seven reviews in chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol as priority areas) to review the evidence for children's pain using pharmacological interventions. As one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for children and adolescents in the world today, childhood cancer (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Specific mortality and morbidity data relating to children are not currently identified. All childhood cancer rates are on the rise; for example, in the USA approximately 10,380 children aged under 15 years were expected to be diagnosed with cancer by the end of 2016. However, with survival rates also increasing, over 80% of paediatric cancer patients are expected to survive for five years or more, thus identifying the need to address pain management in this population. Cancer pain in infants, children, and adolescents is primarily nociceptive pain with negative long term effects. Cancer-related pain is generally caused directly by the tumour itself such as compressing on the nerve or inflammation of the organs. Cancer-related pain generally occurs as a result of perioperative procedures, nerve damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy treatments, or mucositis. However, this review focused on pain caused directly by the tumour itself such as nerve infiltration, external nerve compression, and other inflammatory events. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammatory properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. NSAIDs are currently licensed for use in western countries, however not approved for infants aged under three months. Primary adverse effects include gastrointestinal issues and possible renal impairment with long term use. Other adverse effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy, and adverse events, of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat cancer-related pain in children and adolescents aged from birth and 17 years, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 21 February 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials of any dose, and any route, treating cancer-related pain in children and adolescents, comparing NSAIDs with placebo or an active comparator.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and planned to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

No studies were eligible for inclusion in this review (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels due to the lack of data reported for any outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce cancer-related pain in children and adolescents. This means that no reliance or conclusions can be made about efficacy or harm in the use of NSAIDs to treat chronic cancer-related pain in children and adolescents.

### Pain in children who have life-limiting conditions [^1126DqyM]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents who have life-limiting conditions are vulnerableto acute and chronic pain problems. Many compounding and complicatingfactors often need to be explored in this setting. Barriers to effective painmanagement include poor assessment and measurement of pain anda lack of specialist knowledge. Fears regarding the use of opioids and theirassociation with the end of life must be addressed openly and with clarity. Day-to-day management should include continual appraisal of pain issuesif quality of life is to be maximized. Pain is a complicated phenomenon. The impact of pain and the compli-cated dynamic of suffering in children and young people who have life-lim-iting conditions must not be underestimated. The clinician must be vigilantand take responsibility for all aspects of pain management in these patients.

### Psychosocial perspectives in the treatment of pediatric chronic pain [^117XoK37]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic pain in children and adolescents is associated with major disruption to developmental experiences crucial to personal adjustment, quality of life, academic, vocational and social success. Caring for these patients involves understanding cognitive, affective, social and family dynamic factors associated with persistent pain syndromes. Evaluation and treatment necessitate a comprehensive multimodal approach including psychological and behavioral interventions that maximize return to more developmentally appropriate physical, academic and social activities. This article will provide an overview of major psychosocial factors impacting on pediatric pain and disability, propose an explanatory model for conceptualizing the development and maintenance of pain and functional disability in medically difficult-to-explain pain syndromes, and review representative evidence-based cognitive behavioral and systemic treatment approaches for improving functioning in this pediatric population.

### Assessment and management of pain syndromes and arthritis pain in children and adolescents [^113pwPh3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain, whether it is idiopathic or disease-related, is common in childhood. Pediatric rheumatologists and other pediatric health care providers must understand the epidemiology of musculoskeletal pain as part of childhood, diagnose pain syndromes in children and rule out rheumatic disease, and be willing to initiate treatment of pain in children and adolescents. Practitioners' ability to carry out these tasks is enhanced by an awareness of the biopsychosocial model of pain, which integrates biologic, environmental, and cognitive behavioral mechanisms in describing the causes and maintenance of children's pain. A growing body of research in rheumatic diseases, such as JIA, and idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as JPFS, highlights the importance of environmental and cognitive behavioral influences in the pain experience of children in addition to the contribution of disease activity. These influences include factors innate in the child, such as emotional distress, daily stress, coping, and mood, and familial factors, such as parental psychologic health, parental pain history, and the nature of family interactions. Addressing these issues, while providing aggressive traditional medical management, optimizes pain treatment and improves overall quality of life for children who have musculoskeletal pain.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^115esAxa]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, AAP 2024 guidelines recommend to prefer immediate-release opioid formulations when prescribing opioids for acute pain in pediatric and adolescent patients, starting with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses and providing an initial supply of ≤ 5 days, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with an expected duration of pain of > 5 days.

### Associations between pain, health, and lifestyle factors in 10-year-old boys and girls from a Swedish birth cohort [^111B7mvy]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In our current study, the reports that symmetrical, bilateral frequent pain was more common than unilateral frequent pain is an interesting finding, however, the groups were too small to perform statistical tests. Bilateral pain is often described as one of the main features of growing pains. The etiology of growing pains is unknown, but many parents report that children have episodes of growing pains during childhood. In the Lancet report, the authors request more comprehensive pain assessments throughout childhood. Symmetrical bilateral pain is not commonly reported in cohort studies, and following the development of bilateral pain over time might further add to our knowledge of pediatric pain.

Regarding factors associated with frequent pain in boys and girls in this study, interesting similarities and differences were found. Reporting a better score in all domains of HRQoL, as measured by Kidscreen-27, was associated with lower risk of being categorized into the frequent pain group for girls, but only in two domains for boys. In general, children and adolescents with pain usually score worse on HRQoL than those without pain. The same can also be seen in adolescent athletes. The influence of pain on HRQoL seems to be more extensive in girls than in boys at 10 years of age. This could indicate that girls at an earlier age than boys show stronger associations between pain and low HRQoL, a phenomenon well known in adults with longstanding pain. Interestingly, the relationship between having a longstanding disease or disability and frequent pain was more pronounced in boys than girls. More quantitative and qualitative research is needed in the area of health perception and pain in boys and girls.

### Approach to the patient with noninflammatory musculoskeletal pain [^112SmqaE]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms at the pediatrician's office. Etiology ranges from benign conditions to serious ones requiring prompt attention. This article addresses entities that present as musculoskeletal pain but are not associated with arthritis. The most common nonarthritic conditions are benign limb pain of childhood (growing pains), hypermobility, overuse syndromes with or without skeletal abnormalities, malignancies, and pain amplification syndromes. The| initial decision process, diagnosis, and treatment options for each of these conditions are discussed.

### The emergence of sex differences in primary pain during adolescence: a conceptual developmentally-oriented biopsychosocial model and opportunities for further investigation [^11698CJv]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Adolescence begins with puberty and is characterized by striking hormonal, physical, psychosocial and neurobiological changes. In childhood, male and female youth have a similar prevalence of chronic pain conditions and similar pain processing. However, this changes dramatically during puberty when females become more pain sensitive and develop significantly more chronic pain compared to males. This pattern persists throughout the lifespan, with female adults twice as likely to report chronic widespread pain as males. The type of pain that seems to increase in prevalence during adolescence (especially in females) is now termed primary pain, meaning that the pain is the primary problem (not secondary to tissue damage or inflammation), and is likely due to nociplastic pain mechanisms. This review takes a developmentally-oriented biopsychosocial perspective on the emergence of sex and gender differences in primary pain by highlighting adolescence as a pivotal period marked by pubertal maturation. Drawing from larger literatures on pediatric pain, neuroimaging, and adolescent development, we identify key biological, behavioral, cognitive-affective, and sociocultural factors that may influence the emergence of sex or gender differences in pain, focusing on primary pain. We then make recommendations for future studies, highlighting the unique insights that can be garnered by considering sex and gender differences and puberty in pain research to inform precision treatments at the most critical developmental periods.

### Who develops chronic pain after an acute lower limb injury? A longitudinal study of children and adolescents [^115xB1v2]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4. Data analysis

Data were merged across 2 time points for children and for parents, cleaned, and summary scores for questionnaires were calculated, reversing items if appropriate. Where at least 50% of data were reported for a questionnaire, we used series mean imputation to complete missing data. Where there were fewer than 50% of responses for a given questionnaire by a participant, no summary score was calculated. We excluded participants who had not completed 3-month pain intensity as we could not determine whether the participant reported chronic pain or not.

We ran descriptives and frequencies to describe participant and injury characteristics. We ran independent t -tests to determine group differences between participants with and without chronic pain. We calculated the number of children reporting chronic pain using 3 metrics; number of children reporting moderate or severe pain (> 4/10 on the NRS at 3 months; primary outcome) and number of children reporting 50% and 30% pain reduction from baseline (secondary outcomes).

Next, we ran correlations and t tests to determine if age, sex, or pubertal status were associated with our dependent variables (presence of chronic pain, functional disability index or paediatric pain interference [PPI]) and therefore needed to be treated as covariates in our regression models. We found that age (r = 0.22, P = 0.021) and sex (t (89) = −2.07, P = 0.021), girls reported higher pain interference compared with boys, were associated with pain interference scores at 3 months, and so we controlled for these variables in the regression models predicting pain interference. No other analyses were significant.

To determine risk factors of developing chronic pain using our primary outcome of no worse than mild pain at 3 months (primary analysis), 30% and 50% pain reduction (secondary outcomes), we conducted 3 logistic regressions. Because of the low percentage of participants reporting chronic pain at 3 months, it was not feasible to run our intended logistic regression with all factors included. Therefore, we undertook an exploratory analysis by including each factor individually and then combining significant predictors in the final model.

### Back pain in children and adolescents [^113S8k66]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Back pain has long been considered an uncommon complaint in the pediatric population. When present, teaching had been that pediatric back pain almost always has a diagnosable cause, many of which are progressive and potentially debilitating. Recent evidence has suggested that pediatric back pain is not only more common than once thought but also, within certain populations, benign and idiopathic. This, in turn, places an increasing amount of pressure on pediatricians to accurately assess and manage their patients presenting with complaints of back pain. The aim of this article is to serve as a review of the current literature on pediatric back pain. The article reviews the epidemiology, basic anatomy, and important elements of a history and examination, which should be considered when a child presents complaining of back pain. Last, a common differential diagnosis with evaluation and management is also given to help guide pediatricians through their medical decision making.

### Osteochondrosis: common causes of pain in growing bones… [^112xk2Kw]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The term osteochondrosis is used to describe a group of disorders that affect patients with an immature skeleton. The etiology of joint pain in these patients is often from osteochondrosis, although traumatic, inflammatory, or infectious origins should be ruled out as well. Osteochondrosis results from abnormal development, injury, or overuse of the growth plate and surrounding ossification centers. Overall, boys are more affected and symptoms generally appear between 10 and 14 years of age. 1 It is thought that boys are more commonly affected because of their greater susceptibility to childhood trauma and overuse injuries. 2 Patients usually present with pain and disability. Areas of the body most often affected include the hip, knee, foot, elbow, and back. 3, 4 There is an increased incidence in patients with low birth weight, abnormal birth presentation, family history, higher birth order, and lower socioeconomic status.

5, 6 Patients present with hip pain, an atraumatic limp, and referred pain in the knee. Limited hip abduction, internal rotation, and leg-length discrepancies are commonly found on physical examination. Knee Pain OSGOOD-SCHLATTER DISEASE Osgood-Schlatter disease, an inflammatory condition, is a common cause of anterior knee pain in children and adolescents. It is caused by repetitive traction of the patellar tendon on the tibial tubercle ossification center or apophysis, which may cause substantial inflammation and pain. Symptomatic patients are usually between 10 and 14 years of age, and up to 30 percent of patients will have bilateral involvement. KÖHLER BONE DISEASE Köhler bone disease is an osteochondrosis of the navicular bone in the foot. Patients often present between two and eight years of age, and boys are three to five times more likely to be affected.

PANNER DISEASE Panner disease is the most common cause of lateral-sided elbow pain in children younger than 10 years. 38 It is characterized by abnormal ossification, necrosis, and degeneration of the distal humeral ossification center. It may or may not be associated with athletic activity. Patients present with vague, lateral-sided elbow pain without point tenderness. Plain radiographs often show fragmentation and fissuring of the entire humeral capitellum. Panner disease is self-limited and generally resolves spontaneously with rest and conservative management, including acetaminophen or NSAIDs.

### The prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents: a systematic review update and meta-analysis [^112afEVg]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there are other systematic reviews on the prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents, the current review is the most comprehensive, examining chronic pain in children from 0 to 19 years from all countries. Other reviews are limited by pain type, age ranges, and geographical locations. These differences may help explain variation in the prevalence of chronic pain reported. For instance, in the current review, the prevalence of abdominal pain was found to be 17.3%, yet in other systematic reviews, the prevalence has ranged from 8.4%to 13.5%. These differences are likely related to different definitions of chronic pain or differences in populations studied, including geographical location. Thus, the current review offers a broad picture of the evidence on the prevalence of chronic pain as defined by the ICD-11, in children and adolescents aged 0 through 19 years worldwide.

Girls had a higher prevalence of chronic headaches, multisite/general pain, and overall pain than boys. This is a similar finding to Liao et al.who found that headache, abdominal, and multisite/general pain were also more prevalent in girls than in boys in their meta-analysis on pediatric chronic pain in low-income and middle-income countries. The higher pain prevalence in girls in comparison to boys may be related to pubertal development, as it has been established that sex differences in pain often emerge during adolescenceand differences in pain experienced during experimental pain tasks start to differ around 12 years of age. The lack of sex differences in back and musculoskeletal pain are of note and worthy of future research. Furthermore, there is an important distinction between sex (biological) and gender (social constructed roles and expression), yet gender is rarely studied directly. As research continues to expand in this area, specific research into sex and gender differences among children and adolescents with chronic pain is recommended to understand the biopsychosocial factors that influence this difference. Furthermore, it is important to consider potential differences between sex and gender and its impact on pediatric chronic pain, as gender is increasingly recognized as a more fluid entity and there is a paucity of evidence in transgender and gender-diverse adolescents. Although there is evidence on the increased risk of pain experiences in gender-diverse youth, there is a lack of evidence on the prevalence in this population, suggesting an important area for future exploration.

### Painful truth: the need to Re-center chronic pain on the functional role of pain [^11255mS2]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Developmental Perspectives on Pain Must Include the Study of Functional Pain

Longitudinal research on pain in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the natural history of functional pain. In the last decades, pain in infancy and childhood has finally gained recognition and due respect, leading to increased research on pain in childhood and its relation to adult pain experience, and many promising findings. However, this developmental work is also dominated by pathological pain; it is largely limited to how acute pain or stressors in childhood increase risk of pain problems later in life, or how pediatric pain symptoms are a risk factor for adult chronic pain. Little if any research exists on understanding functional pain from a developmental perspective.

Research on deprivation in early life and its impact on neurologic development demonstrates that if deprived of "the types and amount of stimulation the brain needs to organize its pathways, then the brain may suffer". By extension, could this mean that exposure to pain inducing stimuli is necessary in some forms in order to develop a healthy pain system, one capable of functional pain? Given neuroplasticity's role in pain perception and processing, early life interventions may impact health of the pain system over the lifespan beyond simply increasing risk of adult chronic pain. For example, what may be excessive analgesia in childhood and what is its impact on the still developing somatosensory system? What are the range of common pain experiences in childhood and how are these related to healthy somatosensory system development? Other than congenitally driven disorders or diabetic neuropathy, is there a phenomenon of acquired insensitivity to pain and what are its risk factors? For example, we know pain sensitivity may change with age but little else is known. Given that research tends not to examine functional pain, it is hard to know the health consequences of its potential impairment through insult, medication or degeneration. As a result, research on pediatric pain and developmental research on pain may benefit from more directly considering the functional role of pain.

### Pain and development: interacting phenomena [^116TnhcR]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

For decades, clinicians and researchers have observed bidirectional relationships between child development and the pain experience in childhood. Pain in childhood is an inherently developmental phenomenon, embedded in an iterative, time-dependent process that reflects individual biological, behavioral, social, psychological, and environmental characteristics that unfold across the early life span. Childhood pain can have wide ranging effects on brain development in ways that contribute-for better and worse-to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being in childhood and on into adulthood. Atypical trajectories of development in the context of disorders such as autism, cerebral palsy, ADHD, and mood/anxiety disorders also contribute to unique childhood pain experiences. In this paper, pain will be considered as a determinant of development, and conversely development will be considered as a key determinant of a child's pain experience. We will discuss how intersectional identities (eg, gender, race, socioeconomic status) and associated social, structural, systemic, and physical environments influence the relationship between development and pain. Finally, we will identify what might be needed to think "developmentally" in ways that extend from the "bench side" in the lab to the "curb side" in the community, integrating a developmental perspective into research and clinical practice to achieve health accessibility and equity in pain care for all children across the developmental spectrum.

### Current status of pain management in children [^116pego7]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Many changes have taken place in pediatric pain management since the undertreatment of children's pain was first reported. Notable advances include an increase in understanding pain during development and improvements in the management of acute pain. Although much more about the safe and effective management of pain in children is now known, this knowledge has not been widely or effectively translated into routine clinical practice. Lack of suitable research on which to firmly establish evidence-based care is likely to have contributed to this situation. A subject of considerable interest recently is the discovery that the experience of pain in early life may lead to long-term consequences. New research findings from laboratory and clinical studies have clearly identified possible mechanisms and provided evidence that long-term behavioral changes can extend far beyond what would be considered the normal period of postinjury recovery. Timing, degree of injury, and administered analgesia and its nature may be important determinants of the long-term outcome of infant pain. Chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, is far more common in children than was thought. The assessment and treatment of this pain and its functional consequences present a considerable unmet challenge. There is a pressing need for further research and clinical development in the management of pain in children.

### The investigation and management of back pain in children [^111gazj1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2008). Low credibility.

Back pain in children and adolescents is probably much less common than in adults, but its true incidence is unknown. Although back pain has traditionally been considered a rare and often sinister presentation in the paediatric age group, recent literature now suggests that a relatively high number of children do experience back pain, but only a small proportion seek medical attention. For the majority of children with back pain no underlying cause is identified, but some require investigation to exclude serious underlying pathology. Laboratory and imaging investigations should be targeted towards those with "red flag" symptoms and signs. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, have an important role in diagnosis of underlying pathology such as infection or malignancy.

Patellofemoral pain — criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies for review in these clinical practice guidelines specify that inclusions were articles published in peer-reviewed journals of designs such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, experimental and quasi-experimental, cohort, case series, and cross-sectional studies, and all outcomes were included. Eligible content included articles reporting on the functional anatomy of the patellofemoral joint; tests and measures for diagnosis and/or differential diagnosis of patellofemoral pain within the scope of physical therapist practice; measurement properties of instruments/tests specific to measuring patellofemoral pain or patellofemoral pain–related outcomes; and studies primarily of adolescents (12 years of age or older) and adults with patellofemoral pain, permitting inclusion of studies that report on persons younger than 12 years of age only if the proportion in the sample is small (less than 5%) or separate data are available for adults; covered topics included risk of patellofemoral pain, diagnostic characteristics, and interventions within the scope of physical therapist practice. Exclusions encompassed meeting abstracts/conference proceedings, press releases, theses, letters to the editor, authors' responses, nonsystematic review articles, case reports, and articles that cannot be retrieved in English; studies primarily of infants and children (younger than 12 years of age); and studies where pain was related primarily to other conditions such as patellar tendinopathy/tendon pain, iliotibial band syndrome, or knee and/or patellofemoral osteoarthritis.

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis [^112SpZ3p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Growing pains

A connection between growing pains (GP) and the future development of FM has been hypothesized. GP are the most common cause of recurring musculoskeletal pain in children, and children with GP have more TP and lower pain thresholds than controls do. A 5-year follow-up study by Uziel et al. of 35 children with GP, found that none developed FM, although the small study cohort was a major limitation to the detection of FM, which is far less common than GP.

Environmental factors

Among adults, FM may be triggered by various environmental "stressors", such as physical trauma and infections, but more evidence is needed to support these associations. An internet survey of over 2500 adult patients with FM found that among those who associated a specific event with their symptom onset, 26.7% described an acute illness. In addition, 43% of patients reported worsening symptoms during infections. No evidence was found regarding the possible efficacy of antibiotic or anti-viral treatment in the management of FM. A possible role of vaccinations in precipitating FM has not been established.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents [^116rnsHd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important. We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions. As the leading cause of morbidity in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (that is pain lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications (nociceptive, neuropathic, or idiopathic) from genetic conditions, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, as well as for other unknown reasons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammation properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently licensed for use in Western countries, however they are not approved for infants under three months old. The main adverse effects include renal impairment and gastrointestinal issues. Common side effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of NSAIDs used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, as well as online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, comparing any NSAID with placebo or an active comparator.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included seven studies with a total of 1074 participants (aged 2 to 18 years) with chronic juvenile polyarthritis or chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All seven studies compared an NSAID with an active comparator. None of the studies were placebo controlled. No two studies investigated the same type of NSAID compared with another. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Risk of bias varied. For randomisation and allocation concealment, one study was low risk and six studies were unclear risk. For blinding of participants and personnel, three studies were low risk and four studies were unclear to high risk. For blinding of outcome assessors, all studies were unclear risk. For attrition, four studies were low risk and three studies were unclear risk. For selective reporting, four studies were low risk, two studies were unclear risk, and one study was high risk. For size, three studies were unclear risk and four studies were high risk. For other potential sources of bias, seven studies were low risk. Primary outcomesThree studies reported participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between meloxicam and naproxen, celecoxib and naproxen, or rofecoxib and naproxen (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence). One study reported participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between low-dose meloxicam (0.125 mg/kg) and high-dose meloxicam (0.25 mg/kg) when compared to naproxen 10 mg/kg (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence). One study reported Patient Global Impression of Change, showing 'very much improved' in 85% of ibuprofen and 90% of aspirin participants (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesAll seven studies reported adverse events. Participants reporting an adverse event (one or more per person) by drug were: aspirin 85/202; fenoprofen 28/49; ibuprofen 40/45; indomethacin 9/30; ketoprofen 9/30; meloxicam 18/47; naproxen 44/202; and rofecoxib 47/209 (very low-quality evidence). All seven studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Participants withdrawn due to an adverse event by drug were: aspirin 16/120; celecoxib 10/159; fenoprofen 0/49; ibuprofen 0/45; indomethacin 0/30; ketoprofen 0/30; meloxicam 10/147; naproxen 17/285; and rofecoxib 3/209 (very low-quality evidence). All seven studies reported serious adverse events. Participants experiencing a serious adverse event by drug were: aspirin 13/120; celecoxib 5/159; fenoprofen 0/79; ketoprofen 0/30; ibuprofen 4/45; indomethacin 0/30; meloxicam 11/147; naproxen 10/285; and rofecoxib 0/209 (very low-quality evidence). There were few or no data for our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning as defined by validated scales; and quality of life as defined by validated scales (very low-quality evidence). We rated the overall quality of the evidence (GRADE rating) for our primary and secondary outcomes as very low because there were limited data from studies and no opportunity for a meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified only a small number of studies, with insufficient data for analysis. As we could undertake no meta-analysis, we are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of NSAIDs to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. Similarly, we cannot comment on our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning; and quality of life. We know from adult randomised controlled trials that some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions.

### "Seeing the light in the shade of it": primary caregiver and youth perspectives on using an inpatient portal for pain care during hospitalization [^111TaxNr]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Studies from multiple countries report that most hospitalized children, especially the youngest and sickest, experience pain that is often severe yet inadequately treated. Evidence suggests this can lead to immediate and lifelong consequences affecting children, families, and communities. Partnership and shared decision-making by children, families, and clinicians is the ideal pediatric healthcare model and can improve care quality and safety, including pain care. A growing evidence base demonstrates that inpatient portals (electronic personal health record applications linked to hospital electronic medical or health records) can improve child and family engagement, outcomes, and satisfaction during hospitalization. This study examined the perspectives of caregivers of hospitalized children and of hospitalized youth about using an inpatient portal to support their engagement in pain care while in hospital. A qualitative descriptive study design was used and 20 participants (15 caregivers and 5 youth) with various painful conditions in one pediatric hospital participated in semistructured interviews. The authors applied a reflexive content analysis to the data and developed 3 broad categories: (1) connecting and sharing knowledge about pain, (2) user-centred designs, and (3) preserving roles. These findings outlined caregiver and youth recommendations for portal configurations that deeply engage and empower children and families in pain care through multidirectional knowledge sharing, supporting caregiver and clinicians' roles without burdening, or replacing human interaction implicit in family-centered pain care. Further research should measure the impact of portals on pain-related outcomes and explore the perspectives of clinicians.

### A cross-national analysis of childhood predictors of physical pain [^116m5y5F]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioural factors that influence physical pain have been largely explored. However, evidence on the childhood circumstances that shape physical pain in adulthood is scarce.

Methods

Using a nationally representative dataset of 202,898 individuals (Age range: 18–99, 49% female, 51% male, 0.03% other) from 22 countries and a random effects meta-analysis, we examine 13 potential childhood predictors of physical pain in adulthood.

Results

We find that childhood experiences, personal attributes, and familial and social circumstances have meaningful and varied associations with adulthood levels of physical pain. Specifically, we find that people whose parents were divorced, single, or died (vs married) when they were children, those who reported that their family found it very difficult to live with their family's household income when they were growing up (vs got by), those who experienced abuse (vs not), felt like an outsider (vs not), reported poor physical health while growing up (vs good) and reported more frequent religious attendance at age 12 (vs never) have a greater risk of experiencing pain later in life. The strength of these associations differs by country reflecting diverse societal influences.

Conclusions

Our study provides valuable insights on the early-life experiences that shape physical pain in adulthood. These findings enhance our understanding of early-life predictors of adult wellbeing and offer comprehensive evidence for designing interventions to reduce physical pain levels.

### Pediatric pain management: the multidisciplinary approach [^111Vtmaq]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a growing problem among children and adolescents, with some epidemiological studies indicating that approximately 30% of children and adolescents experience pain that lasts for 3 months or longer. The most common pediatric chronic pain complaints include migraine, recurrent abdominal pain, and general musculoskeletal pain, including limb pain and back pain.–Chronic pain is often associated with functional disability. In the pediatric population this disability most frequently manifests as school impairment, difficulty maintaining social contacts, decreased participation in recreational activities, impairments in health related quality of life, and an increase in health care utilization.–As a result, these patients exact high costs on the health care system. Clinch and Eccleston described childhood chronic pain as "a modern public health disaster".

This complex health problem requires comprehensive treatment approaches. In recent years, multidisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation centers have gained increasing support as the treatment of choice for chronic pain conditions. Multidisciplinary teams typically consist of multiple providers of varying specialties who work together to assess and develop a treatment plan for a patient and his or her family. Typical disciplines include medicine, psychology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, and psychiatry, sometimes in conjunction with alternative medicine practitioners (eg, acupuncture, massage therapy, etc). This treatment approach should be differentiated from the interdisciplinary model, which is also comprised of several different specialists but who work together under a more fluid structure with flexible collaboration and shared treatment goals, which in the case of chronic pain programs, typically emphasize functional restoration. From this point forward, the term "multidisciplinary" will be used to encompass both treatment approaches.

### Parental accounts of the prevalence, causes and treatments of limb pain in children aged 5 to 13 years: a longitudinal cohort study [^111z4r5T]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

The frequency, cause and treatment of limb pain were ascertained in a cohort of children at six time points between the ages of 5 and 13 years. Data were collected using self-completion questionnaires sent to the chief carers of children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Reports of limb pain over the study period doubled from 15.1% of children aged 5 to 32.5% aged 13; 3.4% of children had limb pain at all time points, 43.4% never reported limb pain and 56.6% reported limb pain on at least one occasion. Growing pains were the most common 'cause' given for limb pains. Limb pain and growing pains were each associated with a family history of arthritis and rheumatism. Limb pain prevalence may have been under-reported in this study due to gradual attrition, particularly in the less educated mothers among whom the highest prevalence of limb pain was reported.

### Other considerations… [^1124UXCo]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain during childhood is common; in population surveys, 16 percent of school-age children reported limb pain. 1 Musculoskeletal pain can be difficult for children to characterize and can cause children and parents great anxiety. Although the cause of acute musculoskeletal pain in children usually is obvious, the cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain or pain that has associated systemic symptoms can be more difficult to determine. The term "growing pains" may be applied mistakenly to children who have a serious rheumatic or malignant disease. Children who have unusual symptoms or abnormal findings on physical examination should be evaluated carefully. 2 discusses common rheumatic causes of musculoskeletal pain in children, as well as treatment and referral recommendations. Nonrheumatic causes of musculoskeletal pain are much more common than rheumatic causes.

An exhaustive list of the many possible causes of musculoskeletal pain in children is beyond the scope of this series but should be considered when screening for underlying disease in children with joint complaints. The family physician must first determine the specific location of the pain. Pain localized to areas other than the joint may be related to connective tissue or muscle involvement. 39 Patients with other types of cancers also may present with nonspecific complaints such as fever and bone or joint pain. 40 Additionally, malignant musculoskeletal tumors account for 5 to 10 percent of malignant neoplasms of childhood; the most common of these lesions are osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

BENIGN NOCTURNAL LIMB PAINS OF CHILDHOOD Benign nocturnal limb pains of childhood are cramping pains of the thigh, shin, and calf; they affect approximately 35 percent of children four to six years of age, although they may occur up to age
19. **41 The exact pathophysiology of the pain is unknown**: it is not associated with the pubertal growth spurt but theoretically may be associated with growth in general. 42 The pain typically occurs in the evening or at night, may awaken the child from sleep, and disappears by morning. Benign nocturnal limb pains are not associated with a limp. BENIGN HYPERMOBILITY SYNDROME Benign hypermobility syndrome occurs typically in young girls before or during adolescence. Patients with this condition present with musculoskeletal pain associated with generalized hypermobility of joints but no associated congenital syndrome. The prevalence of this condition is estimated to range from 8 to 20 percent.

### Ureteroscopy vs shockwave lithotripsy to remove kidney stones in children and adolescents: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^113ZsuD7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Kidney stones affect individuals across their lifespan and often necessitate surgical intervention. Ureteroscopy, an endoscopic surgery, and shockwave lithotripsy, a noninvasive procedure, are the most frequently used procedures to remove kidney and ureteral stones in children and adolescents. For children, both procedures are typically performed as outpatient surgeries under general anesthesia, but they differ in invasiveness and recovery. Ureteral stents, a driver of pain and urinary symptoms, may be placed with either modality but are used more commonly following ureteroscopy. After surgery, residual stone fragments often remain, which may move or grow, resulting in pain and additional surgery.

Clinical guidelines recommend ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy for pediatric patients with ureteral stones and kidney stones smaller than 20 mm. This recommendation is graded C due to consistently low-quality evidence from observational studies and 3 randomized clinical trials. Most studies have demonstrated higher stone clearance for ureteroscopy than shockwave lithotripsy. None have considered patient experiences after surgery. Despite the uncertaintyand equal weight of the recommendations for ureteroscopy and shockwave lithotripsy, 70% to 80% of youths in the US undergo ureteroscopy to remove kidney stones.

The Pediatric Kidney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement Network was established to strengthen the evidence base supporting the treatment of children with nephrolithiasis. The PKIDS study arose from patients' expressed need for improved understanding of the effectiveness of different stone surgeries and the impact of these procedures on their lives. We hypothesized that ureteroscopy would be associated with higher stone clearanceand with lower physical, emotional, and social health compared with shockwave lithotripsy.

### Pain in children: recent advances and ongoing challenges [^114Ws34T]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Significant advances in the assessment and management of acute pain in children have been made, and are supported by an increase in the availability and accessibility of evidence-based data. However, methodological and practical issues in the design and performance of clinical paediatric trials limit the quantity, and may influence the quality, of current data, which lags behind that available for adult practice. Collaborations within research networks, which incorporate both preclinical and clinical studies, may increase the feasibility and specificity of future trials. In early life, the developing nervous system responds differently to pain, analgesia, and injury, resulting in effects not seen in later life and which may have long-term consequences. Translational laboratory studies further our understanding of developmental changes in nociceptor pathway structure and function, analgesic pharmacodynamics, and the impact of different forms of injury. Chronic pain in children has a negative impact on quality of life, resulting in social and emotional consequences for both the child and the family. Despite age-related differences in many chronic pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain, management in children is often empirically based on data from studies in adults. There is a major need for further clinical research, training of health-care providers, and increased resources, to improve management and outcomes for children with chronic pain.

### A meta-ethnography of how children and young people with chronic non-cancer pain and their families experience and understand their condition, pain services, and treatments [^113K2NHF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic non-cancer pain in childhood is widespread, affecting 20% to 35% of children and young people worldwide. For a sizeable number of children, chronic non-cancer pain has considerable negative impacts on their lives and quality of life, and leads to increased use of healthcare services and medication. In many countries, there are few services for managing children's chronic non-cancer pain, with many services being inadequate. Fourteen Cochrane Reviews assessing the effects of pharmacological, psychological, psychosocial, dietary or physical activity interventions for managing children's chronic non-cancer pain identified a lack of high-quality evidence to inform pain management. To design and deliver services and interventions that meet the needs of patients and their families, we need to understand how children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families experience pain, their views of services and treatments for chronic pain, and which outcomes are important to them.

Objectives

1. To synthesise qualitative studies that examine the experiences and perceptions of children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families regarding chronic non-cancer pain, treatments and services to inform the design and delivery of health and social care services, interventions and future research. 2. To explore whether our review findings help to explain the results of Cochrane Reviews of intervention effects of treatments for children's chronic non-cancer pain. 3. To determine if programme theories and outcomes of interventions match children and their families' views of desired treatments and outcomes. 4. To use our findings to inform the selection and design of patient-reported outcome measures for use in chronic non-cancer pain studies and interventions and care provision to children and their families. The review questions are: 1. How do children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families conceptualise chronic pain? 2. How do children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families live with chronic pain? 3. What do children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families think of how health and social care services respond to and manage their child's chronic pain? 4. What do children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families conceptualise as 'good' chronic pain management and what do they want to achieve from chronic pain management interventions and services?

Search Methods

Review strategy: we comprehensively searched 12 bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and grey literature sources, and conducted supplementary searches in 2020. We updated the database searches in September 2022.

Selection Criteria

To identify published and unpublished qualitative research with children aged 3 months to 18 years with chronic non-cancer pain and their families focusing on their perceptions, experiences and views of chronic pain, services and treatments. The final inclusion criteria were agreed with a patient and public involvement group of children and young people with chronic non-cancer pain and their families.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography, a seven-phase, systematic, interpretive, inductive methodology that takes into account the contexts and meanings of the original studies. We assessed the richness of eligible studies and purposively sampled rich studies ensuring they addressed the review questions. Cochrane Qualitative Methods Implementation Group guidance guided sampling. We assessed the methodological limitations of studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. We extracted data on study aims, focus, characteristics and conceptual findings from study reports using NVivo software. We compared these study data to determine how the studies related to one another and grouped studies by pain conditions for synthesis. We used meta-ethnography to synthesise each group of studies separately before synthesising them all together. Analysis and interpretation of studies involved children with chronic non-cancer pain and their families and has resulted in theory to inform service design and delivery. Sampling, organising studies for synthesis, and analysis and interpretation involved our patient and public involvement group who contributed throughout the conduct of the review. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each review finding. We used a matrix approach to integrate our findings with existing Cochrane Reviews on treatment effectiveness for children's chronic non-cancer pain.

Main Results

We synthesised 43 studies sampled from 170 eligible studies reported in 182 publications. Included studies involved 633 participants. GRADE-CERQual assessments of findings were mostly high (n = 21, 58%) or moderate (n = 12, 33%) confidence with three (8%) low or very low confidence. Poorly managed, moderate or severe chronic non-cancer pain had profound adverse impacts on family dynamics and relationships; family members' emotions, well-being, autonomy and sense of self-identity; parenting strategies; friendships and socialising; children's education and future employment prospects; and parental employment. Most children and parents understood chronic non-cancer pain as having an underlying biological cause and wanted curative treatment. However, families had difficulties seeking and obtaining support from health services to manage their child's pain and its impacts. Children and parents felt that healthcare professionals did not always listen to their experiences and expertise, or believe the child's pain. Some families repeatedly visited health services seeking a diagnosis and cure. Over time, some children and families gave up hope of effective treatment. Outcomes measured within trials and Cochrane Reviews of intervention effects did not include some outcomes of importance to children and families, including impacts of pain on the whole family and absence of pain. Cochrane Reviews have mainly neglected a holistic biopsychosocial approach, which specifies the interrelatedness of biological, psychological and social aspects of illness, when selecting outcome measures and considering how chronic pain management interventions work.

Authors' Conclusions

We had high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to most review findings. Further research, especially into families' experiences of treatments and services, could strengthen the evidence for low or very low confidence findings. Future research should also explore families' experiences in low- to middle-income contexts; of pain treatments including opioid use in children, which remains controversial; and of social care services. We need development and testing of family-centred interventions and services acceptable to families. Future trials of children's chronic non-cancer pain interventions should include family-centred outcomes.

### Prevalence of "growing pains" in young children [^114P13Pb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

We estimated the prevalence of recurrent leg pains, often described as "growing pains" in children 4 to 6 years of age in South Australia. We used a survey of the parents of children 4 to 6 years of age, using a validated questionnaire previously developed for this purpose. The sample was systematic and randomized across rural and urban regions, with a total of 1445 valid responses achieved. Frequency statistics were used to obtain the prevalence estimate. The prevalence estimate obtained was 36.9% (95% CI, 32.7–41.1). This study estimated the prevalence of growing pains in a well-designed sample by using a validated instrument of measure. Previous studies have not addressed this age range discretely. The prevalence estimate demonstrates the community impact of this often disregarded condition.

### "I can' T be what I want to be": children's narratives of chronic pain experiences and treatment outcomes [^116w2XmP]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic or recurrent nonmalignant pain is a significant problem for many children and adolescents and often limits the child's participation in normal physical, academic, and social activities.

Objective

To better understand the impact of chronic or recurrent pain on children within the context of their own lives and experiences, using qualitative analysis, and to suggest the applications of the narrative method to clinical practice.

Design

Grounded theory and narrative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted at baseline and 6–12 months following clinic intake.

Setting

Subject homes.

Patients

Fifty-three children ages 10–17 presenting with recurrent pain to a university-based pain clinic. This sample did not differ significantly from the overall clinic population during the study period.

Results

Five common themes were identified; these suggested that isolation, changed self-perception, activity limitations, concerns about barriers to future goals, and lack of medical validation were important to the children's perceived impact of pain on their lives. Five narratives were identified, each of which provided a coherent, integrated description of the factors and perspectives presented by a specific subset of children at baseline. These narratives were then compared against the children's reports of improvement in pain and functioning at 6–12 months; from this comparison, a sixth narrative of therapeutic change emerged for some of the children.

Conclusions

The authors suggest that physicians and parents who take the initiative to elicit the child's narrative can help the child to rewrite the story to promote therapeutic change, a better outcome, and higher satisfaction.
