## Question

evidence for early ambulation of intubated patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for early ambulation of intubated, mechanically ventilated ICU patients, including benefits, safety, timing, and how to reconcile conflicting data. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "early ambulation" and frame the clinical question. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine safety signals and guideline positions. After that, I need to reconcile conflicting results, including the TEAM trial and dose/intensity considerations. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-conscious recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Early ambulation in this context means getting mechanically ventilated patients out of bed to stand or walk, typically within the first week of ICU admission, often within 72–96 hours, as part of a protocolized rehabilitation approach, with the comparator being delayed mobilization or usual-care mobilization that may be less frequent or intense [^762b3a6f] [^11b596e4].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The ATS/ACCP guideline, informed by pooled RCTs, suggests protocolized early mobilization for adults ventilated more than 24 hours, associating it with about 2.7 fewer ventilator days and a higher likelihood of walking at hospital discharge, without mortality benefit, and with low certainty of evidence, which means the recommendation is conditional rather than strong [^1c49dc6a] [^719699a0] [^b587849d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the magnitude and direction across sources. Multiple meta-analyses align with shorter ventilation duration and improved functional outcomes versus late mobilization, though effects versus standard early mobilization are inconsistent and often null, reinforcing that the comparator matters for interpretation [^c00dc1e7] [^7bb2b454] [^11b596e4].

> I will now examine safety, because feasibility and risk are central in intubated patients. Observational and randomized data consistently show that early mobilization is feasible with low rates of serious adverse events when safety criteria are used, including secure airway, acceptable ventilatory parameters, hemodynamic stability, and appropriate monitoring. Serious events like extubation or arrhythmias are uncommon in pooled analyses and large series, though transient desaturation or line issues can occur and are usually manageable [^1c49dc6a] [^44646455] [^30771bb9]. Wait, let me verify the adverse event signal in contemporary trials; the TEAM RCT reported more adverse events with higher-dose early mobilization, but most were nonserious and resolved with session termination, which tempers concern but still warrants cautious dosing and monitoring [^bdb849da].

> But wait, what if the largest modern RCT contradicts benefit? The TEAM trial, enrolling 750 patients across 49 ICUs, found no improvement in days alive and out of hospital at 180 days with higher-dose early active mobilization versus usual care, and actually more adverse events, which seems to undermine earlier enthusiasm. Hold on, I should verify the context: both arms started mobilization around 80 hours after ICU admission, and the usual-care arm already had about 9 minutes per day of active or active-assisted mobilization, so the effective "dose difference" was modest, and both groups achieved similar mobility milestones with only a 1–2 day lag in usual care, explaining a lack of clinically detectable benefit signal in that specific design [^bdb849da] [^ffdbb9c4]. I should double-check the dose–response hypothesis; indeed, meta-analytic and physiologic reasoning suggest that very early initiation, within 72–96 hours, may be the key inflection point, whereas starting after day 3–4 yields attenuated effects, which fits with the TEAM trial's timing and null primary outcome [^11b596e4] [^ffdbb9c4].

> Let me consider timing more carefully. Muscle atrophy and weakness begin within hours of critical illness and mechanical ventilation, so delays beyond 72–96 hours may blunt the capacity for recovery. Observational and trial syntheses indicate that benefits are more consistent when mobilization begins within this window, whereas comparisons with standard early mobilization often show no added benefit, likely because "standard care" in many modern ICUs already includes early, albeit less systematic, mobilization [^046af347] [^11b596e4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought TEAM started at 48 hours; I should correct that — enrollment averaged about 80 hours, which is beyond the hypothesized early window and may explain the neutral findings [^bdb849da].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Major society guidelines converge on a conditional recommendation for early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adults, emphasizing protocolization, safety screening, and team-based delivery, while acknowledging low-to-moderate certainty evidence and the absence of mortality benefit. This reflects a judgment that potential reductions in ventilator days and improved function outweigh risks and resource demands when implemented thoughtfully [^1c49dc6a] [^719699a0] [^6b6f2f8f]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating certainty; yes, all recommendations are conditional, not strong, which matches the evidence quality [^1c49dc6a].

> I should confirm practical safety criteria and implementation details. Expert consensus recommends a traffic-light approach: green for low risk, yellow when benefits likely outweigh risks with extra precautions, and red when consultation is needed. Key thresholds include FiO₂ less than 0.60 with SpO₂ greater than 90%, respiratory rate under 30, hemodynamic stability without escalating vasopressors, and secure airway and lines. Daily sedation minimization and delirium management are essential enablers of mobilization readiness [^d52980bf] [^a3586cd5] [^1cd97c4a]. Hold on, I should verify feasibility data; even in high-acuity cohorts, mobilization to standing or ambulation occurred in a meaningful minority of sessions without serious events when protocols were followed, supporting real-world viability with the right staffing and equipment [^44646455] [^30771bb9].

> Let me synthesize the balance of benefits and harms. Probable benefits include modest reductions in ventilator duration, improved likelihood of independent walking at discharge, and potential reductions in ICU-acquired weakness and delirium, particularly when mobilization starts within 72–96 hours. Harms are generally low but increase with higher-intensity programs, mostly manifesting as transient desaturation, agitation, or line issues that resolve with stopping the session. No consistent mortality benefit or major cost advantage has been demonstrated to date [^1c49dc6a] [^c00dc1e7] [^bdb849da]. I should double-check the cost angle; the TEAM-based economic analysis found no cost-effectiveness advantage at conventional thresholds, though sensitivity analyses suggested potential cost savings if one accepts worse quality-of-life outcomes, which is not a straightforward trade-off in practice [^e52d7189].

> Now, translating this into practice, I need to ensure recommendations are actionable. Start mobilization as early as physiologically feasible, ideally within 72–96 hours of ICU admission, using a protocolized, team-based approach with daily readiness screening, sedation minimization, and predefined stop criteria. Begin with bed mobility and progress to dangling, standing, and ambulation as tolerated, recognizing that even small doses of upright activity can mitigate atrophy and facilitate weaning when done consistently and safely [^1c49dc6a] [^d52980bf] [^1cd97c4a]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with implementation science; yes, embedding mobilization into ABCDE bundles and ensuring nursing and therapy ownership improves uptake and safety in real-world ICUs [^514d0b85] [^b600b815].

> Finally, I should identify knowledge gaps and future directions. We still need large, multicenter RCTs that test very early initiation, standardized dosing, and patient selection strategies, including subgroups such as ARDS, trauma, and COVID-19, where pathophysiology and equipment may modify risk–benefit. We also need better measurement of functional trajectories beyond 6 months and clearer cost-effectiveness data to guide resource allocation and adoption at scale [^c02d3888] [^bdb849da]. I should confirm that ongoing trials are addressing timing and dose; indeed, contemporary and pending studies are exploring these dimensions, which may refine when and how much to mobilize to maximize net benefit [^c02d3888].

Early ambulation of intubated patients is **safe and feasible** when using standardized protocols and safety criteria, with low rates of serious adverse events (about 1% in large series) [^1c49dc6a] [^44646455]. It is associated with **shorter mechanical ventilation**, reduced ICU-acquired weakness, and improved functional outcomes, including higher likelihood of walking at discharge [^1c49dc6a] [^8fad924d]. Guidelines recommend **early mobilization within 2–3 days** of ICU admission for stable patients, with sedation minimization and team-based protocols to enable activity [^1c49dc6a] [^1cd97c4a]. Benefits are greatest when started early and tailored to patient stability; no consistent mortality benefit has been shown, and careful selection and monitoring are essential [^c00dc1e7] [^1c49dc6a].

## Evidence supporting early ambulation

### Safety and feasibility

- **Safety**: Early mobilization is safe with low rates of serious adverse events (e.g. extubation, hemodynamic instability) when using standardized safety criteria and experienced staff [^1c49dc6a] [^44646455].
- **Feasibility**: Even in high-acuity settings, early mobilization is feasible; 69% of patients sat at the bedside, 33% stood, and 15% ambulated ≥ 15 feet during therapy sessions [^44646455].
- **Barriers**: Sedation, hemodynamic instability, and device-related concerns are common but modifiable barriers to mobilization [^30771bb9] [^f399fc27].

---

### Clinical outcomes

- **Ventilator duration**: Early mobilization is associated with shorter mechanical ventilation (mean reduction ~2.7 days) [^1c49dc6a].
- **ICU-acquired weakness**: Early mobilization reduces the incidence and severity of ICU-acquired weakness, improving muscle strength and functional recovery [^8fad924d] [^89ddf466].
- **Functional outcomes**: Patients are more likely to walk at discharge and have better short-term physical function with early mobilization [^1c49dc6a] [^c00dc1e7].
- **Mortality**: No consistent mortality benefit has been demonstrated, though some studies suggest potential improvements in long-term outcomes [^1c49dc6a] [^bdb849da].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines converge on **conditional recommendations** for early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adults:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ATS/ACCP | Protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization for patients ventilated > 24 hours (conditional, low certainty) [^1c49dc6a] [^719699a0] |
| SCCM | Early exercise and mobilization may shorten ventilation, reduce ICU stay, lower VAP, and improve return to independence (moderate quality evidence) [^8fad924d] [^1cd97c4a] |
| ISHLT | Early ambulation is recommended to decrease postoperative complications (Class I, Level C) [^388eaec3] |

---

## Optimal timing and protocol

- **Timing**: Initiating mobilization within 2–3 days of ICU admission yields the greatest benefits, particularly when the difference with the comparator is largest [^c00dc1e7] [^11b596e4].
- **Protocol**: Structured, team-based protocols with daily readiness screening, sedation minimization, and progressive activity (bed mobility → sitting → standing → ambulation) are effective [^1c49dc6a] [^1cd97c4a].
- **Safety criteria**: Use standardized safety checks (e.g. FiO₂ < 0.60, SpO₂ > 90%, MAP > 65 mmHg, no active arrhythmias) before each session [^d52980bf] [^a3586cd5].

---

## Risks and limitations

- **Adverse events**: Transient desaturation, hemodynamic changes, and device-related issues can occur but are usually manageable and rarely serious [^1c49dc6a] [^972aa71c].
- **Patient selection**: Unstable patients (e.g. high FiO2, vasopressors, severe encephalopathy) may not tolerate mobilization and require individualized risk–benefit assessment [^d52980bf] [^a3586cd5].
- **Resource needs**: Early mobilization requires staffing, training, and equipment; cost-effectiveness varies by setting and implementation [^e52d7189] [^9557e6c8].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In COVID-19, early mobilization is feasible with enhanced precautions, though **evidence is limited** and decisions should be individualized [^7f3b7b36]. In pediatrics, early mobilization is increasingly recommended, with **growing evidence of safety and feasibility** in PICU settings [^37aa1a12] [^21ca5950]. For trauma and surgical patients, early mobilization is supported to reduce complications and promote recovery, with **protocols adapted to patient stability and injuries** [^e0838bbd] [^652b43eb].

---

## Summary of evidence

Early ambulation of intubated patients is **safe and feasible** with appropriate protocols and yields meaningful benefits in ventilation duration, muscle strength, and functional recovery. The strongest evidence supports initiation within 2–3 days of ICU admission, with sedation minimization and team-based care. While mortality benefit is unproven, the functional and recovery advantages justify routine use when clinically appropriate, with careful patient selection and monitoring [^1c49dc6a] [^8fad924d].

### Evidence-based practices for acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review of reviews [^bb5e911f]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The recent pandemic highlights the essential nature of optimizing the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in complex critical care settings. This review of reviews maps evidence-based practices (EBPs) that are associated with better outcomes among adult patients with acute respiratory failure or ARDS on the continuum of care, from intubation to liberation.

Research Question

What EPBs are recommended to reduce the duration of IMV and mortality rate among patients with acute respiratory failure/ARDS?

Study Design and Methods

We identified an initial set of reports that links EBPs to mortality rates and/or duration of IMV. We conducted a review of reviews, focusing on preappraised guidelines, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. We searched Scopus, CINAHL, and PubMed from January 2016 to January 2019 for additional evidence that has not yet been incorporated into current guidelines.

Results

Our initial search produced 61 publications that contained 42 EBPs. We excluded 42 manuscripts during the data extraction process, primarily because they were not associated with improved patient outcomes. The remaining 19 preappraised guidelines, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews met our full inclusion criteria and spanned the continuum of IMV care from intubation to liberation. These contained 20 EBPs, a majority of which were supported with moderate levels of evidence. Of these, six EBPs focused on intubation and escalation of care, such as ventilator management and synchrony; ten EBPs reduced complications associated with IMV, which included spontaneous awakening and breathing trials and early mobility protocols; and four EBPs promoted timely extubation and postextubation recovery.

Interpretation

This review describes EBPs that are associated with fewer ventilator days and/or lower mortality rates among patients who received IMV for acute respiratory failure/ARDS. Many of these EBPs are connected across the care continuum, which indicates the need to promote and assess effective implementation jointly, rather than individually.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults: an Official American College of Chest Physicians / American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: inspiratory pressure augmentation during spontaneous breathing trials, protocols minimizing sedation, and noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation [^719699a0]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST guideline — early mobilization rehabilitation after mechanical ventilation > 24 h: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 h, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (Conditional Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another. The evidence synthesis demonstrated that patients who received an intervention directed toward early mobilization had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be able to walk at hospital discharge. There were no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-min walk distance, or ventilator-free days. Low rates of serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, have been reported. This recommendation places a high value on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and maintenance of ambulation and a lower value on cost and resource use.

### Physiotherapy in intensive care: an updated systematic review [^9d33a6b2]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although physiotherapy is frequently provided to patients in the ICU, its role has been questioned. The purpose of this systematic literature review, an update of one published in 2000, was to examine the evidence concerning the effectiveness of physiotherapy for adult, intubated patients who are mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

Methods

The main literature search was undertaken on PubMed, with secondary searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Only papers published from 1999 were included. No limitations were placed on study design, intervention type, or outcomes of clinical studies; nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Items were checked for relevance and data extracted from included studies. Marked heterogeneity of design precluded statistical pooling of results and led to a descriptive review.

Results

Fifty-five clinical and 30 nonclinical studies were reviewed. The evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of routine multimodality respiratory physiotherapy is conflicting. Physiotherapy that comprises early progressive mobilization has been shown to be feasible and safe, with data from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that it can improve function and shorten ICU and hospital length of stay.

Conclusions

Available new evidence, published since 1999, suggests that physiotherapy intervention that comprises early progressive mobilization is beneficial for adult patients in the ICU in terms of its positive effect on functional ability and its potential to reduce ICU and hospital length of stay. These new findings suggest that early progressive mobilization should be implemented as a matter of priority in all adult ICUs and an area of clinical focus for ICU physiotherapists.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5adbaa18]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Study types

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German, French or Italian language were included. We did not consider observational evidence as we assumed a high probability of confounding by indication and differences in the provision of early mobilization between patients in a non-standardized, non-randomized setting.

Information sources and search strategy

To identify relevant studies, we followed a two-stage systematic search process based on previously published high-quality systematic reviews. In the first stage, we systematically searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases for relevant systematic reviews published between 2015 and 2019. We assessed the identified systematic reviews in full text for eligibility and selected high-quality systematic reviews based on the Assessing the Methodology of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) assessment checklist. The selected high-quality systematic reviews were then used as a basis to identify potentially eligible RCTs. All records identified in these reviews were included in the full-text assessment in the second stage of our systematic review.

In the second stage, we performed a systematic follow-up search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases to identify more recently published studies. We adopted the search strategies of the high-quality reviews, additionally applying the Cochrane sensitivity and precision-maximizing RCT filter. Each search was conducted for a timeframe starting two months prior to the last search in the respective review up to January 17, 2019, to account for a potential lag in the indexing of publications (see Additional file 1 for detailed search strategies). Additional references were identified through bibliographies of included studies and registry records. We screened the title and abstract of all records retrieved through the update searches and pooled potentially eligible records with the records retrieved from the high-quality systematic reviews. After deduplication, we assessed the pooled references in full text to select eligible studies. All study selection processes were carried out independently and in duplicate by three reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with an experienced senior reviewer.

Data extraction

We extracted information regarding the study design, study population characteristics, intervention and comparator details (i.e. modality, timing, frequency, duration), measured outcomes and follow-up. Where reporting of intervention, comparator or results was insufficient to allow judgments about the categorization of studies, we consulted study protocols and contacted authors for additional information. Data extraction was performed in duplicate by three reviewers.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^f399fc27]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization in critically ill burn patients — current practice and perceived barriers are heterogeneous, with variable ambulation of intubated patients and specific clinician concerns. While mobilization out of bed was used in all six burn centers, only four reported ambulating intubated patients; in a 2021 survey of 63 burn rehabilitation clinicians, 54% mobilize intubated patients out of bed and 50% mobilize patients on vasopressor support; among non-burn ICU clinicians in Canada, 60% overestimated ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) and 60% felt they lacked the skill and knowledge to mobilize a ventilated patient, and common perceived barriers included patient medical instability (91% of PTs, 77% of MDs), excessive sedation (64% of PTs, 58% of MDs), risk of dislodgement of lines or devices (21% of PTs, 55% of MDs), obesity (20% of PTs, 37% of MDs), and cognitive impairment (22% of PTs vs 37% of MDs).

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^36383dde]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we only found little evidence for a beneficial effect of systematic early mobilization on MRC-SS, incidence of ICUAW, 6MWT performance, time needed until walking, proportion of patients returning to independence from assistance, SF-36 PFS and SF-36 PCS. While there was a general trend for an improvement in patient outcomes across trials, we found no evidence in support of systematic early mobilization when compared with standard early mobilization. Effects were generally stronger for the comparison of systematic early with late mobilization, and there was low to very low certainty evidence for a benefit with respect to the time to walking, return to independence, as well as SF-36 PFS and PCS at 6 months after discharge (see Additional file 4). Results were similar between groups for further outcomes related to muscle strength and physical function outcomes, cognitive and mental health outcomes, health-related quality of life, length of stay, duration of ventilation and mortality. Systematic early mobilization appeared safe when conducted under adequate monitoring.

Early mobilization during ICU care — acutely hospitalized adults ventilated for more than 24 hours: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). Evidence indicated a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and patients more likely to be able to walk at hospital discharge, with no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-minute walk distance, or ventilator-free days; low rates of serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, have been reported. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^7bb2b454]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis found a beneficial effect of systematic early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients on muscle strength and physical function when compared to late mobilization, but did not find evidence for such an effect when compared to standard early mobilization initiated within 7 days of ICU admission. This contrast widens the perspective on early mobilization in the ICU, highlighting the need to consider the characteristics of comparator interventions when interpreting RCT-based evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice.

### Early versus late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients [^c3af7bef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of early tracheostomy as an intervention for critically ill COVID-19 patients is unclear. Previous reports have described prolonged intensive care stays and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, particularly in those developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pre-pandemic evidence on the benefits of early tracheostomy is conflicting but suggests shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates compared to late tracheostomy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, which comprises CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv, as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 14 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) evaluating early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy during SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill adults irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for NRSIs. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes of our prioritized categories: mortality, clinical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. As the timing of tracheostomy was very heterogeneous among the included studies, we applied GRADE only to studies that defined early tracheostomy as 10 days or less, which was chosen according to clinical relevance.

Main Results

We included one RCT with 150 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 NRSIs with 6372 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were admitted to the ICU, orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. The RCT was a multicenter, parallel, single-blinded study conducted in Sweden. Of the 24 NRSIs, which were mostly conducted in high- and middle-income countries, eight had a prospective design and 16 a retrospective design. We did not find any ongoing studies. RCT-based evidence We judged risk of bias for the RCT to be of low or some concerns regarding randomization and measurement of the outcome. Early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.29; RD 67 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 178 fewer to 108 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of improvement of clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (MD 1.50 days fewer, 95%, CI 5.74 days fewer to 2.74 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of worsening clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in the incidence of adverse events of any grade (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13; RD 47 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 164 fewer to 102 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence); little to no difference in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.20; RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 162 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported need for renal replacement therapy. Early tracheostomy may result in little benefit to no difference in ICU length of stay (MD 0.5 days fewer, 95% CI 5.34 days fewer to 4.34 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). NRSI-based evidence We considered risk of bias for NRSIs to be critical because of possible confounding, study participant enrollment into the studies, intervention classification and potentially systematic errors in the measurement of outcomes. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases overall mortality (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.00; RD 143 more per 1000, 95% CI 174 less to 1218 more; I² = 79%; 2 studies, 719 participants) or duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation (MD 1.98 days fewer, 95% CI 0.16 days fewer to 4.12 more; 1 study, 50 participants), because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low. Three NRSIs reported ICU length of stay for 519 patients with early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) as a median value, which we could not include in the meta-analyses. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases the ICU length of stay, because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. In terms of clinical improvement, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. We are not certain about the impact of early tracheostomy on clinical worsening in terms of the incidence of adverse events, need for renal replacement therapy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or the length of stay in the ICU. Future RCTs should provide additional data on the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy for defined main outcomes of COVID-19 research, as well as of comparable diseases, especially for different population subgroups to reduce clinical heterogeneity, and report a longer observation period. Then it would be possible to draw conclusions regarding which patient groups might benefit from early intervention. Furthermore, validated scoring systems for more accurate predictions of the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation should be developed and used in new RCTs to ensure safer indication and patient safety. High-quality (prospectively registered) NRSIs should be conducted in the future to provide valuable answers to clinical questions. This could enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and harms of early tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c00dc1e7]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of systematic early mobilization in improving muscle strength and physical function in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

We conducted a two-stage systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library until January 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of early mobilization initiated within 7 days after ICU admission compared with late mobilization, standard early mobilization or no mobilization. Priority outcomes were Medical Research Council Sum Score (MRC-SS), incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW), 6-min walk test (6MWT), proportion of patients reaching independence, time needed until walking, SF-36 Physical Function Domain Score (PFS) and SF-36 Physical Health Component Score (PCS). Meta-analysis was conducted where sufficient comparable evidence was available. We evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Results

We identified 12 eligible RCTs contributing data from 1304 participants. Two RCTs were categorized as comparing systematic early with late mobilization, nine with standard early mobilization and one with no mobilization. We found evidence for a benefit of systematic early mobilization compared to late mobilization for SF-36 PFS (MD 12.3; 95% CI 3.9–20.8) and PCS (MD 3.4; 95% CI 0.01–6.8), as well as on the proportion of patients reaching independence and the time needed to walking, but not for incidence of ICUAW (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38–1.03) or MRC-SS. For systematic early compared to standard early mobilization, we found no statistically significant benefit on MRC-SS (MD 5.8; 95% CI − 1.4 to 13.0), incidence of ICUAW (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.63–1.27), SF-36 PFS (MD 8.1; 95% CI − 15.3 to 31.4) or PCS (MD − 2.4; 95% CI − 6.1 to 1.3) or other priority outcomes except for change in 6MWT from baseline. Generally, effects appeared stronger for systematic early compared to late mobilization than to standard early mobilization. We judged the certainty of evidence for all outcomes as very low to low.

Conclusion

The evidence regarding a benefit of systematic early mobilization remained inconclusive. However, our findings indicate that the larger the difference in the timing between the intervention and the comparator, the more likely an RCT is to find a benefit for early mobilization.

### Knowledge translation tools to guide care of non-intubated patients with acute respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic [^42894459]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may present with various etiologies of ARI, requiring differing support levels for oxygenation and ventilation. The evidence for NRS versus early ETI in COVID-19 is still evolving. Despite limitations of existing data, HCPs must still act with the best knowledge available. In that context, it is prudent to suspect COVID-19 infection in all patients with respiratory symptoms and/or hypoxemia until ruled out, but suspicion of COVID-19 does not necessitate early intubation in all patients. Selected patients may be managed with NRS provided appropriate precautions are taken to mitigate nosocomial transmission, patients are closely monitored, and hypoxemic patients proceed to prompt intubation when necessary.

### Early versus late tracheostomy for critically ill patients [^1bc5d894]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term mechanical ventilation is the most common situation for which tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). 'Early' and 'late' tracheostomies are two categories of the timing of tracheostomy. Evidence on the advantages attributed to early versus late tracheostomy is somewhat conflicting but includes shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early (≤ 10 days after tracheal intubation) versus late tracheostomy (> 10 days after tracheal intubation) in critically ill adults predicted to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation with different clinical conditions.

Search Methods

This is an update of a review last published in 2012 (Issue 3, The Cochrane Library) with previous searches run in December 2010. In this version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to August 2013); EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to August 2013); LILACS (1986 to August 2013); PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) at www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au (1999 to August 2013) and CINAHL (1982 to August 2013). We reran the search in October 2014 and will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs or QRCTs) comparing early tracheostomy (two to 10 days after intubation) against late tracheostomy (> 10 days after intubation) for critically ill adult patients expected to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and conducted a quality assessment. Meta-analyses with random-effects models were conducted for mortality, time spent on mechanical ventilation and time spent in the ICU.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs (N = 1977 participants). At the longest follow-up time available in these studies, evidence of moderate quality from seven RCTs (n = 1903) showed lower mortality rates in the early as compared with the late tracheostomy group (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98; P value 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) ≅ 11). Divergent results were reported on the time spent on mechanical ventilation and no differences were noted for pneumonia, but the probability of discharge from the ICU was higher at day 28 in the early tracheostomy group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; P value 0.006; NNTB ≅ 8).

Authors' Conclusions

The whole findings of this systematic review are no more than suggestive of the superiority of early over late tracheostomy because no information of high quality is available for specific subgroups with particular characteristics.

### Early versus late tracheostomy for critically ill patients [^106f777b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term mechanical ventilation is the most common situation where tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units (ICU). 'Early' and 'late' tracheostomies are two categories of the timing of tracheostomy. The evidence on the advantages attributed to early over late tracheostomy is somewhat conflicting but includes shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early (≤ 10 days after intubation) versus late tracheostomy (> 10 days after intubation) in critically ill adult patients predicted to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation and with different clinical conditions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 12); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to December 2010); EMBASE (via Ovid) (from 1974 to December 2010); LILACS (1986 to December 2010); PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) at www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au (1999 to December 2010) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2010).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials which compared early tracheostomy (two to10 days after intubation) against late tracheostomy (> 10 days after intubation) for critically ill adult patients expected to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation. There was no language restriction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data and conducted a quality assessment. Meta-analyses using the random-effects model were conducted for mortality and pneumonia.

Main Results

We included four studies, with a high risk of bias, in which a total of 673 patients were randomized to either early or late tracheostomy. We could not pool data in a meta-analysis because of clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity between the included studies. There is no strong evidence for real differences between early and late tracheostomy in the primary outcome of mortality. In one study a statistically significant result favouring early tracheostomy was observed in the outcome measuring time spent on ventilatory support (mean difference (MD) -9.80 days, 95% CI -11.48 to -8.12, P < 0.001).

Authors' Conclusions

Updated evidence is of low quality, and potential differences between early and late tracheostomy need to be better investigated by means of randomized controlled trials. At present there is no specific information about any subgroup or individual characteristics potentially associated with better outcomes with either early or late tracheostomy.

### Should early mobilization Be routine in mechanically ventilated patients? [^ff65da3a]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness is a major complication of critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Early mobilization has been shown to decrease the negative consequences of ICU-acquired weakness. However, early mobilization might entail risks to the patient. Additional staffing needs might have a negative financial impact. This review examines whether early mobilization should be routinely performed in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c94e6ca2]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias assessment

We assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and evaluated study-level bias as recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). As blinding of personnel is commonly not possible in the context of rehabilitative interventions, this domain was not considered for the study-level assessment.

Data synthesis

We primarily used a narrative synthesis due to the high heterogeneity between RCTs, measured outcomes and follow-up time points. As we considered the comparator interventions to be a major source of heterogeneity, we report results stratified by comparator category (i.e. late mobilization, standard early mobilization or no mobilization). Studies were categorized according to the timing and the nature of the comparator intervention. Studies in which the comparator did not meet the definition of early mobilization were assigned to the late mobilization category. Studies in which the comparator was also administered early, but in a less protocol-driven and consistent manner, according to less strict criteria or not in all eligible patients, were assigned to the standard early mobilization category. Studies that could not be categorized with respect to the timing of the comparator were also assigned to the standard early mobilization category, in order to enable separate evaluation of studies in which a clear timing difference between groups was present (i.e. comparing early with late mobilization). Studies with a sham procedure or no rehabilitative intervention as comparator were assigned to the no mobilization category.

We conducted pairwise fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses for outcomes that were reported by at least three studies. Studies reporting median and interquartile range (IQR) only were not included in the meta-analyses. We report risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Study heterogeneity was assessed visually using forest plots and statistically using the I²-statistic. We further conducted sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity. We planned to conduct heterogeneity assessment based on predefined factors (continuation of the intervention post ICU discharge, intervention type, study population characteristics, study-level risk of bias) and to assess small study effects using funnel plots and Egger's test, where appropriate. However, the number of studies for each reported outcome was too low to allow a meaningful assessment. Preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and length of ICU stay were not possible because no separate data were reported for these populations. We used R (version 3.5.2) for all statistical analyses.

### Knowledge translation tools to guide care of non-intubated patients with acute respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic [^04ca4160]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Providing optimal care to patients with acute respiratory illness while preventing hospital transmission of COVID-19 is of paramount importance during the pandemic; the challenge lies in achieving both goals simultaneously. Controversy exists regarding the role of early intubation versus use of non-invasive respiratory support measures to avoid intubation. This review summarizes available evidence and provides a clinical decision algorithm with risk mitigation techniques to guide clinicians in care of the hypoxemic, non-intubated, patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although aerosolization of droplets may occur with aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP), including high flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, the risk of using these AGMP is outweighed by the benefit in carefully selected patients, particularly if care is taken to mitigate risk of viral transmission. Non-invasive support measures should not be denied for conditions where previously proven effective and may be used even while there is suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Patients with de novo acute respiratory illness with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 may also benefit. These techniques may improve oxygenation sufficiently to allow some patients to avoid intubation; however, patients must be carefully monitored for signs of increased work of breathing. Patients showing signs of clinical deterioration or high work of breathing not alleviated by non-invasive support should proceed promptly to intubation and invasive lung protective ventilation strategy. With adherence to these principles, risk of viral spread can be minimized.

### Anticipating mechanical ventilation in Guillain-Barrésyndrome… [^2ba7ef31]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

In their observational series of 19 patients, Ropper and Kehne6 established strict criteria for intubation in GBS based on previously defined clinical and respiratory factors. 7 Patients were intubated when clinical evidence of fatigue or severe oropharyngeal weakness resulting in aspiration occurred. They also intubated when vital capacity measurements fell below 15 mL/kg or if PO₂ values were less than 70 mm Hg on room air. 6 Many textbooks have since reiterated the guidelines for intubation adhered to in this article. 8–10 These clinical and respiratory factors are accurate in determining when to proceed with intubation but do not provide guidance for the early respiratory management of patients with GBS. Nine patients had no appreciable decline prior to intubation. Three of these patients had an initial VC less than 20 mL/kg and were intubated soon thereafter.

The other 6 patients were intubated for airway protection because of bulbar weakness or significant hypoxia related to superimposed pneumonia. Forty-eight percent of patients were intubated between the hours of 6 PM and 8 AM, although most of these seemed to be semielective procedures. Urgent intubation, necessitated by respiratory or cardiac arrest or extreme respiratory distress, occurred in 16% of patients. No clinical features predicted those at risk of a decline in VC. However, gradual decline should allow elective intubation. Rapid decompensation, which occurred in a significant number of patients, was only detected by serial measurements combined with clinical examination. Because rapid decompensation can occur, even in those with a seemingly predictable course, ICU admission should be considered when the above threshold respiratory values are reached, or if there is significant bulbar weakness.

The finding that a low VC or bulbar dysfunction was associated with a high likelihood of progression to respiratory failure should be analyzed in the context of the study design. Both of these are reasons to intubate and are, therefore, inextricably linked to the institution of mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, the findings identified in our study can be used in early management decisions in patients with GBS. Moreover, this study has also demonstrated that a 30% reduction in respiratory factors and certain threshold values were associated with subsequent intubation. These values may provide early warning signs of significant respiratory decline, which are independent of values that necessitate intubation, allowing opportunity for intervention or closer observation.

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^c02d3888]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Evidence is still evolving about early mobilization in ICU with ongoing large, multi-center trials. Further research is needed to understand the optimal timing, type and dose of interventions, and their effect on long-term patient outcomes. These 10 strategies provide guidance for implementing early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU with the goal of optimizing safety and effectiveness to improve patients' experiences and outcomes.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3158f861]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

6-Min walk test

Only two studies reported results on 6MWT, both comparing systematic early with standard early mobilization. 6MWT distances achieved by study participants were comparable between the two studies. Denehy et al. demonstrated an increase in 6MWT distance in both groups from ICU discharge up to 12 months of follow-up. While there was no difference in 6MWT distances between groups beyond ICU discharge, they reported a statistically significantly higher mean change from baseline at 3 months (MD 63.7 m; 95% CI 14.2–113.2; p < 0.05) and 12 months (MD 72.7 m; 95% CI 9.3–135.8; p < 0.05) in the systematic early mobilization group. Eggmann et al. did not find evidence for a difference in 6MWT distance between groups at hospital discharge. We judged the certainty of evidence for a benefit of systematic early mobilization on 6MWT compared to standard early mobilization as low.

Time needed until walking

Three studies reported on the time needed by patients until walking for the first time. Schweickert et al. reported a statistically significantly shorter time to walking in the systematic early mobilization group when compared to late mobilization (low certainty). In contrast, Hodgson et al. did not find a between-group difference when comparing systematic early with standard early mobilization (very low certainty). Data from Eggmann et al. were insufficient to draw a conclusion.

Proportion of patients returning to independence from assistance

Only the study by Schweickert et al. reported the proportion of patients returning to independence from assistance during hospitalization. They found a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients reaching independence in the systematic early mobilization group compared to the late mobilization group (low certainty).

### Early intervention (mobilization or active exercise) for critically ill adults in the intensive care unit [^972aa71c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Survivors of critical illness often experience a multitude of problems that begin in the intensive care unit (ICU) or present and continue after discharge. These can include muscle weakness, cognitive impairments, psychological difficulties, reduced physical function such as in activities of daily living (ADLs), and decreased quality of life. Early interventions such as mobilizations or active exercise, or both, may diminish the impact of the sequelae of critical illness.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early intervention (mobilization or active exercise), commenced in the ICU, provided to critically ill adults either during or after the mechanical ventilation period, compared with delayed exercise or usual care, on improving physical function or performance, muscle strength and health-related quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We searched conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles, databases of trial registries and contacted experts in the field on 31 August 2017. We did not impose restrictions on language or location of publications.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared early intervention (mobilization or active exercise, or both), delivered in the ICU, with delayed exercise or usual care delivered to critically ill adults either during or after the mechanical ventilation period in the ICU.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles against the inclusion criteria of this review. We resolved any disagreement through discussion with a third review author as required. We presented data descriptively using mean differences or medians, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (a total of 690 participants), in this review. Participants were adults who were mechanically ventilated in a general, medical or surgical ICU, with mean or median age in the studies ranging from 56 to 62 years. Admitting diagnoses in three of the four studies were indicative of critical illness, while participants in the fourth study had undergone cardiac surgery. Three studies included range-of-motion exercises, bed mobility activities, transfers and ambulation. The fourth study involved only upper limb exercises. Included studies were at high risk of performance bias, as they were not blinded to participants and personnel, and two of four did not blind outcome assessors. Three of four studies reported only on those participants who completed the study, with high rates of dropout. The description of intervention type, dose, intensity and frequency in the standard care control group was poor in two of four studies. Three studies (a total of 454 participants) reported at least one measure of physical function. One study (104 participants) reported low-quality evidence of beneficial effects in the intervention group on return to independent functional status at hospital discharge (59% versus 35%, risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 2.64); the absolute effect is that 246 more people (95% CI 38 to 567) per 1000 would attain independent functional status when provided with early mobilization. The effects on physical functioning are uncertain for a range measures: Barthel Index scores (early mobilization: median 75 control: versus 55, low quality evidence), number of ADLs achieved at ICU (median of 3 versus 0, low quality evidence) or at hospital discharge (median of 6 versus 4, low quality evidence). The effects of early mobilization on physical function measured at ICU discharge are uncertain, as measured by the Acute Care Index of Function (ACIF) (early mobilization mean: 61.1 versus control: 55, mean difference (MD) 6.10, 95% CI -11.85 to 24.05, low quality evidence) and the Physical Function ICU Test (PFIT) score (5.6 versus 5.4, MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.98 to 1.38, low quality evidence). There is low quality evidence that early mobilization may have little or no effect on physical function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery score at ICU discharge from one study of 184 participants (mean 1.6 in the intervention group versus 1.9 in usual care, MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.50), or at hospital discharge (MD 0, 95% CI -1.00 to 0.90). The fourth study, which examined postoperative cardiac surgery patients did not measure physical function as an outcome. Adverse effects were reported across the four studies but we could not combine the data. Our certainty in the risk of adverse events with either mobilization strategy is low due to the low rate of events. One study reported that in the intervention group one out of 49 participants (2%) experienced oxygen desaturation less than 80% and one of 49 (2%) had accidental dislodgement of the radial catheter. This study also found cessation of therapy due to participant instability occurred in 19 of 498 (4%) of the intervention sessions. In another study five of 101 (5%) participants in the intervention group and five of 109 (4.6%) participants in the control group had postoperative pulmonary complications deemed to be unrelated to intervention. A third study found one of 150 participants in the intervention group had an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia, but completed the exercise session. The fourth study reported no adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence on the effect of early mobilization of critically ill people in the ICU on physical function or performance, adverse events, muscle strength and health-related quality of life at this time. The four studies awaiting classification, and the three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once these results are available. We assessed that there is currently low-quality evidence for the effect of early mobilization of critically ill adults in the ICU due to small sample sizes, lack of blinding of participants and personnel, variation in the interventions and outcomes used to measure their effect and inadequate descriptions of the interventions delivered as usual care in the studies included in this Cochrane Review.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11b596e4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Results in context

Several systematic reviews have addressed early mobilization in recent years. Conclusions drawn by these reviews differ as to whether or not the evidence is sufficiently strong to conclude that early mobilization provides a benefit on muscle strength, physical function, quality of life, mortality, length of stay and other outcomes. While Doiron et al. and Castro-Avila et al. reported no statistically significant effects on outcomes related to muscle strength and physical function, Fuke et al. Okada et al. and Zang et al. found a statistically significant benefit with early mobilization. This discrepancy primarily stems from slight differences in the inclusion of RCTs. Our review excluded some studies that were included in other reviews due to ineligibility of the study population or late initiation of the mobilization intervention. Conversely, we included the recent study by Eggmann et al. which found no evidence for a benefit comparing early mobilization with standard care with a very small timing difference between groups (median 47 vs. 52 h). This may explain why our review did not find sufficient evidence to conclude an effect of early mobilization on muscle strength or physical function outcomes.

As discussed by other authors, the definition of 'early mobilization' varies strongly across studies. While there is no uniform consensus, the field appears to increasingly define early mobilization as starting within 72 h of ICU admission. Ding et al. attempted to identify the optimal starting time for early mobilization in a network meta-analysis of 15 RCTs, from which they concluded that initiation of mobilization within 72–96 h of mechanical ventilation would be most beneficial for the improvement of ICUAW. Unfortunately, their analysis did not account for timing differences between intervention and comparator groups.

However, the difference in timing between intervention and comparator group may be an important determinant for identifying a benefit of systematic early mobilization in studies. Our findings suggest that systematic early mobilization may be effective when compared to late mobilization, but there was insufficient evidence for a benefit of systematic early mobilization compared to standard early mobilization. Thus, the difference in timing between intervention and comparator groups may be at least as important as the absolute timing of the first mobilization in the intervention group. We consider the separate analysis of different comparator categories a unique strength of our systematic review, as this contrast sheds light on an important issue when interpreting the available evidence on early mobilization. Treatment recommendations on early mobilization need to consider comparator group interventions in trials to judge whether more systematic or earlier mobilization approaches may provide additional clinical benefits over standard care and are cost-effective in the respective context.

### Secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient [^626428f0]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient includes routine methods for maintaining mucociliary function, as well as techniques for secretion removal. Humidification, mobilization of the patient, and airway suctioning are all routine procedures for managing secretions in the ventilated patient. Early ambulation of the post-surgical patient and routine turning of the ventilated patient are common secretion-management techniques that have little supporting evidence of efficacy. Humidification is a standard of care and a requisite for secretion management. Both active and passive humidification can be used. The humidifier selected and the level of humidification required depend on the patient's condition and the expected duration of intubation. In patients with thick, copious secretions, heated humidification is superior to a heat and moisture exchanger. Airway suctioning is the most important secretion removal technique. Open-circuit and closed-circuit suctioning have similar efficacy. Instilling saline prior to suctioning, to thin the secretions or stimulate a cough, is not supported by the literature. Adequate humidification and as-needed suctioning are the foundation of secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient. Intermittent therapy for secretion removal includes techniques either to simulate a cough, to mechanically loosen secretions, or both. Patient positioning for secretion drainage is also widely used. Percussion and postural drainage have been widely employed for mechanically ventilated patients but have not been shown to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia or atelectasis. Manual hyperinflation and insufflation-exsufflation, which attempt to improve secretion removal by simulating a cough, have been described in mechanically ventilated patients, but neither has been studied sufficiently to support routine use. Continuous lateral rotation with a specialized bed reduces atelectasis in some patients, but has not been shown to improve secretion removal. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation combines percussion with hyperinflation and a simulated cough, but the evidence for intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients is insufficient to support routine use. Secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient consists of appropriate humidification and as-needed airway suctioning. Intermittent techniques may play a role when secretion retention persists despite adequate humidification and suctioning. The technique selected should remedy the suspected etiology of the secretion retention (eg, insufflation-exsufflation for impaired cough). Further research into secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient is needed.

### Timing of intubation in COVID-19: not just location, location, location? [^7eace761]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the paper by Papoutsi et. al. in which they synthesise the available evidence for early versus late intubation for COVID-19-related respiratory failure. While many studies have reported on predictors of mortality in severe COVID-19, the majority of these factors are not modifiable. The selection for and timing of the escalation to mechanical ventilation are modifiable and of particular relevance in resource-constrained settings to optimise the use of ICU resources.

Differentiating between the timing of intubation once admitted to ICU for 24 h (the primary definition in their study) or intubation based on a trial of non-invasive mechanical support (their secondary definition) has vastly different implications. At our institution, a decision was made to reserve and expand ICU services only for COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and to offer high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in a non-critical care ward-based environment. Patients coming to the ICU were all intubated outside of the ICU having had a trial of HFNO. Our patients would be considered early intubations by the primary definition, and late intubations in the secondary analysis.

In our cohort of 293 patients, we had 52.7% survival without mechanical ventilation (with a median P/F ratio of 68 on non-rebreather support at initiation of HFNO) and a median duration of HFNO support of 6 days in survivors, and 2 days in non-survivors. Unfortunately, this result needs to be balanced against the initial poor outcomes (8% survival) of those patients who progressed to need invasive mechanical ventilation. We would therefore caution against a definition of early intubation that is based on the patient accessing a physical location (ICU) or level of support (HFNO) without quantifying the severity of the patient's underlying respiratory failure or need for other organ support.

It is essential that studies provide consistent information on the severity of illness and information is given on context and setting when reporting studies on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. We noted that 5 of the 12 studies did not report the SOFA score of the patients at the time of ICU admission and that 6 of the 12 publications analysed required the authors to supply additional information from that published in order to allow this analysis. Understanding the clinical triggers for accessing ICU care, the severity of respiratory failure prior to intubation, and the available resources in a particular setting is key to assessing time-sensitive interventions such as intubation.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^62944ba4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

We considered nine out of twelve RCTs to be at high risk of bias in one or more criteria and therefore rated them as of 'poor overall quality'. Two studies were judged to be of 'good overall quality' and one study of 'fair overall quality'. The most frequent issues apart from the blinding of participants and personnel were incomplete outcome data and concerns related to selective reporting. Figure 2 shows an overview of the risk of bias assessment (see Additional file 2 for details). While the number of RCTs reporting results for each priority outcome was low, we found no indication for a small study effect that may have influenced our results. The GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence is presented in Table 3.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^6017deb8]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study reports on the development of consensus recommendations outlining safety considerations prior to the mobilization of adult, mechanically ventilated patients in an ICU setting. The implementation of these recommendations has the potential to maximize early mobilization while minimizing the risk of adverse safety events, which in turn might improve functional outcomes and translate into reduced ICU and hospital length of stay. Future research required includes systematic evaluation of these recommendations.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^48e2d916]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to develop consensus recommendations on safety parameters for mobilizing adult, mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

A systematic literature review was followed by a meeting of 23 multidisciplinary ICU experts to seek consensus regarding the safe mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients.

Results

Safety considerations were summarized in four categories: respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and other. Consensus was achieved on all criteria for safe mobilization, with the exception being levels of vasoactive agents. Intubation via an endotracheal tube was not a contraindication to early mobilization and a fraction of inspired oxygen less than 0.6 with a percutaneous oxygen saturation more than 90% and a respiratory rate less than 30 breaths/minute were considered safe criteria for in- and out-of-bed mobilization if there were no other contraindications. At an international meeting, 94 multidisciplinary ICU clinicians concurred with the proposed recommendations.

Conclusion

Consensus recommendations regarding safety criteria for mobilization of adult, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU have the potential to guide ICU rehabilitation whilst minimizing the risk of adverse events.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^046af347]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle atrophy commences early, within hours of commencement of invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, patients who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation are at high risk of muscle atrophy, severe weakness, long-term disability, and increased mortality. To mitigate these risks, early mobilisation has been recommended in at least seven international guidelines. It is a management strategy that has had widespread support from clinicians.

Early mobilisation will purportedly reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and delirium and improve functional recovery, although the evidence from individual trials has been inconsistent. The evidence for the international guidelines has been pooled from pilot studies, phase II trials, observational studies, and expert consensus.

Clinical practice guidelines universally recommend implementation of early mobilisation activities in the intensive care unit (ICU). Each of the guidelines has made recommendations for operationalising early mobilisation differently, reflecting the heterogeneity across included studies. Almost all of the guidelines highlight the importance of considerations of the ABCDE (awakening, breathing, coordination, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility) bundle of care. As clinicians implement mobilisation, consideration for a patient's level of sedation and delirium is crucial, as the main barrier reported to early mobilisation is sedation. Other important factors for implementation include clinician expertise and the availability of specific mobilisation equipment. Daily evaluation of a patient's physiological status for the suitability of mobility activities and a-priori considerations for terminating a mobility session should be discussed. However, clinical practice guidelines should be considered according to the comprehensiveness and recency of the systematic review informing the guidelines, given the recent increase in primary research evaluating early mobilisation.

### Effect of enhanced versus usual mobilization activities in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^89ddf466]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to capture updated evidence regarding the benefits and harms of enhanced mobilization activities and explore whether specific approaches may be more beneficial than others.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

This study was prospectively registered PROSPERO: CRD42024550360. Parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included adult patients (≥ 18 yr old) admitted to the ICU were included. The intervention group was required to receive enhanced mobilization activities above usual care while in the ICU, while the control group received usual care, which was required to include some degree of mobilization. Four databases and two trial registries were searched until May 2024. Review and data extraction of all potentially eligible articles was performed independently and in duplicate. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-nine RCTs (n = 8462) met eligibility criteria. Enhanced mobilization activities may reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95; moderate certainty), duration of delirium (mean difference [MD], -1.34 d; 95% CI, -1.85 to -0.83; low certainty), and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (MD, -1.07 d; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.50 d; moderate certainty). ICU and hospital length of stay may also be slightly reduced by enhanced mobilization (low certainty). Enhanced mobilization may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low certainty).

Conclusions

This review demonstrates that enhanced mobilization likely reduces the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness and may reduce duration of delirium, while supporting prior findings that there is little to no difference in risk of adverse events. Early mobilization may be the most promising avenue for optimizing mobilization activities and raise the question of whether the key to improving outcomes lies in early exposure to these activities rather than increased intensity.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in the cardiac intensive care unit [^71353a8f]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Tracheostomy

Upward of one-third of patients intubated for > 48 hours in the medical ICU eventually receive a tracheostomy. While rates of tracheostomy in the heterogenous CICU patient population are unknown, one study which included nearly 200,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock found the incidence of tracheostomy to be 5.7%, including 15% of patients who were intubated for > 96 hours. There are several potential benefits of tracheostomy, including reduced patient discomfort, reduced need for sedation, increased early mobilization, and improved weaning from IMV. However, the impact of tracheostomy on mortality and the ideal timing are still controversial. Furthermore, there is wide variation in timing based on patient populations (eg, trauma vs pneumonia) as well as center-specific patterns.

Two RCTs may provide guidance on tracheostomy timing. One study randomized 419 patients receiving IMV for > 48 hours to early (6–8 days) or late (13–15 days) tracheostomy. Only 69% of the patients in the early and 57% of the subjects in the late group underwent tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator days, ICU days, or mortality. Another, multicenter study randomized patients on IMV for < 4 days and deemed likely to require at least 7 more days of IMV to early (within 4 days) compared to late (after 10 days) tracheostomy. They did not find a difference in mortality, ICU length of stay, or adverse events. In addition, clinician assessment of extended ventilator requirement was limited as only 44.9% of patients in the late group eventually required a tracheostomy. Taken together, we generally recommend waiting between 10 and 14 days before pursuing a tracheostomy, given mixed data and the limited clinical ability to predict prolonged ventilator requirements.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1d5da316]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, we defined 'early mobilization' as mobilization starting within 7 days of ICU admission in line with previous reviews on the subject. Using a stricter definition limiting the intervention to early mobilization within 72 h after ICU admission would have led to the exclusion of one study and re-categorization of two studies into the late mobilization category. This would have resulted in an even weaker evidence base for systematic early mobilization compared to both late mobilization and standard early mobilization. However, it would not have altered our main conclusions.

Second, we categorized studies into comparator categories based on predefined criteria. Due to the heterogeneity of 'early mobilization' between studies, it could occur that the comparator in one study was similar in timing or nature to the experimental intervention in another study, or vice versa. This was especially the case in the standard early mobilization category. Alternative assessments showed that if studies for which the timing difference between intervention and comparator group was unclear were excluded from analysis, this would not have altered our conclusions for any of the priority outcomes. Had these studies been assigned to the late mobilization category, we would have found smaller and not statistically significant effects on MRC-SS, incidence of ICUAW, SF-36 PFS and PCS for the comparison between systematic early and late mobilization. However, our conclusions regarding the comparison between systematic early and standard early mobilization would have remained unchanged. Since our categorization may not fully reflect the timing differences between studies, a more detailed consideration of interventions and comparators in the individual studies may be warranted when making recommendations for practice.

Third, we excluded studies with relevant proportions of neurological, burns, transplant or postoperative patients requiring only short ventilation. This, as well as the language restriction, may have led to the exclusion of some studies that would have provided additional evidence and could have altered our results.

Fourth, we did not conduct a more detailed analysis of the frequency, duration and intensity, or exact implementation of the interventions. While these factors are likely to influence the effectiveness of interventions, the available information did not provide a sufficient basis for such comparisons.

Finally, we did not perform subgroup analyses other than by comparator category. While it is possible that specific patient subgroups may benefit more strongly from early mobilization than others, the available data were insufficient to conduct such subgroup analyses.

### Effect of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized cohort studies [^10baf25c]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although several international guidelines recommend early over late intubation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this issue is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. "Early" was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while "late" as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147).

Results

A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99–1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD -0.58 days, 95% CI -3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.25, p = 0.08).

Conclusions

The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.

American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians guideline — summary of recommendations: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). We suggest managing acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours with a ventilator liberation protocol (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). We suggest performing a cuff leak test in mechanically ventilated adults who meet extubation criteria and are deemed high risk for postextubation stridor (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). For adults who have failed a cuff leak test but are otherwise ready for extubation, we suggest administering systemic steroids for at least 4 hours before extubation (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence).

Early tracheostomy — potential benefits and limits: Consider early tracheostomy (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials suggests that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) may be associated with a 40% decrease in VAP rates, less time on mechanical ventilation, and fewer ICU days but no difference in mortality. Decision makers should integrate these potential benefits with each patient's values and preferences when determining whether and when to proceed with tracheostomy.

### Effect of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized cohort studies [^e8caefb0]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Back to the poliomyelitis epidemic of 1952, Dr. Henry Lassen from Copenhagen had reportedly noted that his American colleagues used to "put their patients in the respirators far too early". Therefore, since the birth of critical care, the optimal timing of intubation of patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seems to be a matter of debate. This debate is reinforced during the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Since the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, several guidelines from China, United Kingdom, United States of America and Australia recommend early intubation of critically ill patients with COVID-19 as a means to protect health care workers from cross-infection and to avoid complications (including cardiac arrest) associated with "crash" intubations. Experts of clinical respiratory physiology seemed to back this approach with notions that early intubation might prevent ensuing patient self-inflicted lung injury. However, on the basis of physiological principles, other experts argued against early intubation. Therefore, there seemed to be reasonable arguments in favor of either an early or a late intubation approach in COVID-19 and relevant studies were subsequently planned to address this clinical question.

Several studies reporting on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation have indeed been published. However, the accumulated evidence has not yet been synthesized. Thus, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis in an attempt to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

### Feasibility of physical and occupational therapy beginning from initiation of mechanical ventilation [^44646455]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Physical and occupational therapy are possible immediately after intubation in mechanically ventilated medical intensive care unit patients. The objective of this study was to describe a protocol of daily sedative interruption and early physical and occupational therapy and to specify details of intensive care unit-based therapy, including neurocognitive state, potential barriers, and adverse events related to this intervention.

Design and Patients

Detailed descriptive study of the intervention arm of a trial of mechanically ventilated patients receiving early physical and occupational therapy.

Setting

Two tertiary care academic medical centers participating in a randomized controlled trial.

Intervention

Patients underwent daily sedative interruption followed by physical and occupational therapy every hospital day until achieving independent functional status. Therapy began with active range of motion and progressed to activities of daily living, sitting, standing, and walking as tolerated.

Measurements and Main Results

Forty-nine mechanically ventilated patients received early physical and occupational therapy occurring a median of 1.5 days (range, 1.0–2.1 days) after intubation. Therapy was provided on 90% of MICU days during mechanical ventilation. While endotracheally intubated, subjects sat at the edge of the bed in 69% of all physical and occupational therapy sessions, transferred from bed to chair in 33%, stood in 33%, and ambulated during 15% (n = 26 of 168) of all physical and occupational therapy sessions (median distance of 15 feet; range, 15–20 feet). At least one potential barrier to mobilization during mechanical ventilation (acute lung injury, vasoactive medication administration, delirium, renal replacement therapy, or body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m) was present in 89% of patient encounters. Therapy was interrupted prematurely in 4% of all sessions, most commonly for patient-ventilator asynchrony and agitation.

Conclusion

Early physical and occupational therapy is feasible from the onset of mechanical ventilation despite high illness acuity and presence of life support devices. Adverse events are uncommon, even in this high-risk group.

### Intubation and in-hospital mortality after trauma with Glasgow coma scale score eight or less – A cohort study [^7d5f5e74]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most trauma societies recommend intubating trauma patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores ≤ 8 without robust supporting evidence. We examined the association between intubation and 30-d in-hospital mortality in trauma patients arriving with a GCS score ≤ 8 in an Indian trauma registry.

Methods

Outcomes of patients with a GCS score ≤ 8 who were intubated within 1 h of arrival (intubation group) were compared with those who were intubated later or not at all (nonintubation group) using various analytical approaches. The association was assessed in various subgroup and sensitivity analyses to identify any variability of the effect.

Results

Of 3476 patients who arrived with a GCS score ≤ 8, 1671 (48.1%) were intubated within 1 h. Overall, 1957 (56.3%) patients died, 947 (56.7%) in the intubation group and 1010 (56.0%) in the nonintubation group, with no significant difference in mortality (odds ratio = 1.2 [confidence interval, 0.8–1.8], P value = 0.467) in multivariable regression and propensity score-matched analysis. This result persisted across subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Patients intubated within an hour of arrival had longer durations of ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Intubation within an hour of arrival with a GCS score ≤ 8 after major trauma was not associated with differences in-hospital mortality. The indications and benefits of early intubation in these severely injured patients should be revisited to promote optimal resource utilization in LMICs.

Postoperative patients — based on low-level evidence, incentive spirometry is not recommended for routine, prophylactic use in postoperative patients; early mobility and ambulation is recommended to reduce postoperative complications and promote airway clearance; and ACT is not recommended for routine postoperative care. Supporting findings in postoperative populations indicate that studies focused on CPT did not demonstrate a reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications or hospital stay, and no improvement in pulmonary function was reported with the addition of CPT to routine care; given the low level of evidence for any ACT, no high-level recommendations can be made at this time.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^a3586cd5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Color coding definitions.

The group decided that recommendations would be developed only for active mobilization and that no guidance would be provided with respect to safety criteria for passive mobilization. Active mobilization was defined as any activity where the patient assists with the activity using their own muscle strength and control: the patient may need assistance from staff or equipment, but they are actively participating in the exercise. Activities that comprise active mobilization are out-of-bed mobilization (that is, any activity where the patient sits over the edge of the bed (dangling), stands, walks, marches on the spot or sits out of bed) and in-bed mobilization (that is, any activity undertaken whilst the patient is sitting or lying in bed such as rolling, bridging, upper-limb weight training). The level of mobilization should be determined by the patient's strength and endurance, as well as an assessment of the safety criteria.

The safety criteria covered by the consensus group were divided into four categories: (1) respiratory considerations, including intubation status, ventilatory parameters and the need for adjunctive therapies; (2) cardiovascular considerations, including the presence of devices, cardiac arrhythmias and blood pressure; (3) neurological considerations, including level of consciousness, delirium and intracranial pressure, and (4) other considerations, including lines and surgical or medical conditions.

Respiratory safety considerations

Prior to each episode of mobilization, an appropriate healthcare professional, according to the procedures of each individual ICU, should check that any artificial airway present (that is, orotracheal, nasotracheal or tracheostomy tube) is correctly positioned and secure. Additionally, any supplemental oxygen that may be required by the patient should be available with an adequate oxygen reserve that exceeds the expected duration of the mobility activity (as unexpected delay or increased requirements may occur). The group agreed that endotracheal tube intubation was not in itself a contraindication to early mobilization and that a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) less than 0.6 was a safe criterion for in- and out-of-bed mobilization if there were no other contraindications. Other respiratory safety recommendations are summarized in Figure 2. If the patient was at the safety limits for several categories (for example, low percutaneous oxygen saturation, high FiO₂ and high positive end expiratory pressure), an experienced medical team should be consulted prior to mobilization.

### The way in which a physiotherapy service is structured can improve patient outcome from a surgical intensive care: a controlled clinical trial [^74e271dc]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The physiological basis of physiotherapeutic interventions used in intensive care has been established. We must determine the optimal service approach that will result in improved patient outcome. The aim of this article is to report on the estimated effect of providing a physiotherapy service consisting of an exclusively allocated physiotherapist providing evidence-based/protocol care, compared with usual care on patient outcomes.

Methods

An exploratory, controlled, pragmatic, sequential-time-block clinical trial was conducted in the surgical unit of a tertiary hospital in South Africa. Protocol care (3 weeks) and usual care (3 weeks) was provided consecutively for two 6-week intervention periods. Each intervention period was followed by a washout period. The physiotherapy care provided was based on the unit admission date. Data were analyzed with Statistica in consultation with a statistician. Where indicated, relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Significant differences between groups or across time are reported at the alpha level of 0.05. All reported P values are two-sided.

Results

Data of 193 admissions were analyzed. No difference was noted between the two patient groups at baseline. Patients admitted to the unit during protocol care were less likely to be intubated after unit admission (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.71; RRR, 0.84; NNT, 5.02; P = 0.005) or to fail an extubation (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.98; RRR, 0.77; NNT, 6.95; P = 0.04). The mean difference in the cumulative daily unit TISS-28 score during the two intervention periods was 1.99 (95% CI, 0.65 to 3.35) TISS-28 units (P = 0.04). Protocol-care patients were discharged from the hospital 4 days earlier than usual-care patients (P = 0.05). A tendency noted for more patients to reach independence in the transfers (P = 0.07) and mobility (P = 0.09) categories of the Barthel Index.

Conclusions

A physiotherapy service approach that includes an exclusively allocated physiotherapist providing evidence-based/protocol care that addresses pulmonary dysfunction and promotes early mobility improves patient outcome. This could be a more cost-effective service approach to care than is usual care. This information can now be considered by administrators in the management of scarce physiotherapy resources and by researchers in the planning of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST guideline — early mobilization rehabilitation in acutely hospitalized adults mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours: In pooled analyses, intervention directed toward early mobilization was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 2.7 fewer days) and a higher ability to walk at hospital discharge (64.0% vs. 41.4%; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15–2.10), with no meaningful differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-minute-walk distance, or ventilator-free days. The panel considered the 2.7-day reduction to be large relative to an 8-day average duration across the four trials, and a large case series reported low serious adverse event rates during rehabilitation (6.5 events per 1,000 physical therapy sessions) and for arrhythmias (1.9 events per 1,000 physical therapy sessions). For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, the panel states "we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence)", with the remark that "There is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another", and values and preferences that "place a high value on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and increasing the likelihood of being able to walk at discharge and a lower value on cost and resource use".

### Timing of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with sepsis: the impact of excluding non-intubated patients [^d12a83e8]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Early initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) may represent a potentially beneficial approach for sepsis patients. A recent study by Kim et al. published in Critical Care, provides evidence supporting this approach, reporting that earlier IMV initiation (on the first day of ICU admission) may be associated with lower mortality.

However, in their study, 2,363 patients who never required IMV during their ICU stay were excluded from the analysis. While this approach focuses on patients who received IMV, it may inadvertently select a population with more severe illness for comparison, potentially introducing bias into the results. In clinical practice, a subset of sepsis patients may benefit from a wait-and-see strategy, where intubation is avoided through the use of non-invasive ventilation or other supportive measures, potentially reducing the risks associated with IMV. Excluding these patients from the analysis may have influenced the reported outcomes and the perceived benefits of early IMV.

### Clinical trials of early mobilization of critically ill patients [^4d07c488]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness is a common complication of critical illness leading to severe functional impairment in many intensive care unit survivors. Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation are routinely immobilized for prolonged time periods. This immobilization is exacerbated by frequent administration of sedative agents. Recently, several investigators have described the feasibility and potential benefits of mobilizing mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. Such an intervention requires a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care, involving nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and respiratory therapy practitioners. Recent studies of early mobilization of mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients have noted this intervention to be safe and associated with improved functional outcomes in this extremely ill patient cohort. Such outcomes include high percentages of patients able to ambulate on intensive care unit and hospital discharge and shortened hospital length of stay. With preliminary studies demonstrating remarkable feasibility and successes, further prospective studies of early mobilization are needed to evaluate this intervention.

### Early versus late tracheostomy in people with multiple trauma [^627e722b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

According to TraumaRegister DGU (the trauma registry of the German Trauma Society), 83% of trauma patients are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with 34.8% receiving mechanical ventilation. However, specific data for people with multiple trauma are lacking. Prolonged ventilation due to acute respiratory failure or difficult weaning are common indications for tracheostomy in critically ill people. Despite numerous studies, the optimal timing for tracheostomy remains unclear. This review was initiated during the development of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) S3 guideline 'Intensivmedizin nach Polytrauma' (intensive care after multiple trauma) to systematically assess the effects of early versus late tracheostomy in people with multiple trauma in the ICU.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy in adults with multiple trauma in the intensive care unit.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from inception to 15 March 2024 without language restrictions. We also screened reference lists and contacted experts in the field.

Eligibility Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing early and late tracheostomy, defined according to any cutoff time point, in critically ill adults with multiple trauma, irrespective of sex, ethnicity, disease severity, or setting. We excluded studies published as abstract only, studies recruiting people with only one type of trauma, and studies recruiting people who needed immediate tracheostomy.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was all-cause mortality. Important outcomes included duration of stay (ICU or hospital), quality of life, pulmonary complications, adverse events, and time from tracheostomy to decannulation.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane risk of bias tools (RoB 2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for NRSIs) to assess risk of bias at the outcome level.

Synthesis Methods

Our meta-analyses used a random-effects model. Our main comparison was early tracheostomy (< 10 days) versus late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days) after intubation. Because the timing of early tracheostomy varied considerably across studies, we explored the impact of different timings in subgroup analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included one RCT (60 participants) and 22 NRSIs (44,811 participants). The RCT was a single-centre, parallel-group trial conducted in the USA over 38 months. It was halted prematurely after the first interim analysis. Most NRSIs (91%) were retrospective. Six studies, including the RCT, specifically addressed our main comparison (< 10 days vs ≥ 10 days).

Synthesis Of Results

Evidence from the RCT (60 participants) suggested that early tracheostomy (< 10 days) compared with late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days) may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 2.03; very low-certainty evidence), ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% CI -17.64 to 17.04; very low-certainty evidence), or rate of pneumonia (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.22; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence for all three outcomes is very uncertain. No data were available for quality of life, adverse events, or time from tracheostomy to decannulation. NRSI data suggested that early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.88) or rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (unadjusted RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.56). One NRSI with adjusted data suggested that early tracheostomy may reduce ICU length of stay (1/HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.71), while unadjusted data from two NRSIs suggested that early tracheostomy may increase in-hospital mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36; odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.41). The evidence for all these outcomes was very uncertain. The certainty of the evidence was consistently rated as very low across outcomes. The most common reason for downgrading was imprecision, due to small sample sizes, wide CIs including both benefit and harm, and analyses including data from only one study. In NRSIs, additional downgrades were due to serious risk of bias, particularly related to potential confounding and unclear adjustment for baseline differences. We identified one ongoing trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Early tracheostomy (< 10 days after intubation) may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, ICU length of stay, or rate of pneumonia compared with late tracheostomy (≥ 10 days), but the evidence is very uncertain. No data were available on quality of life, adverse events, or time from tracheostomy to decannulation. Adjusted NRSI data suggest that early tracheostomy may reduce ICU length of stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Given the limited RCT data and the heterogeneity of NRSIs, future research should focus on standardising definitions of multiple trauma and timing of tracheostomy, while also addressing equity by including diverse populations and settings. More high-quality studies are needed to confirm possible benefits of early tracheostomy, with particular attention to adjusted analyses and outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay, and pulmonary complications. Further studies should also explore the long-term effects of tracheostomy on survival, quality of life, and functional outcomes to guide evidence-based clinical decision-making in multiple trauma care.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1cd97c4a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Minimize sedation

Minimize sedation of ventilated patients whenever possible (Quality of Evidence: HIGH).
Preferentially use multimodal strategies and medications other than benzodiazepines to manage agitation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). Examples include analgesics for pain, reassurance for anxiety, and antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine, and/or propofol for agitation. Dexmedetomidine and propofol are associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay compared to benzodiazepines. A randomized trial of light sedation with dexmedetomidine versus propofol found no difference in ventilator-free days or mortality. Dexmedetomidine may decrease need for intubation in patients on noninvasive ventilation.
Utilize a protocol to minimize sedation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). Potential strategies to minimize sedation include nurse-driven protocols for targeted light sedation and daily sedative interruptions (ie, spontaneous awakening trials) for patients without contraindications. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials reported that protocols to minimize sedation were associated with significantly shorter ICU length of stay compared to managing patients without protocols. There was no significant association between the use of protocols to minimize sedation and duration of mechanical ventilation or short-term mortality. There was insufficient evidence to recommend one protocol over another. A small, single-center, randomized trialsuggested that patients managed with no sedation (but morphine as needed) versus propofol or midazolam may be extubated sooner and have shorter ICU length of stay, but a subsequent multicenter randomized trial of no sedation versus light sedation with daily sedative interruptions reported no difference in ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, or 90-day mortality.
Implement a ventilator liberation protocol (Quality of Evidence: HIGH) Assess readiness to extubate daily in patients without contraindications (i.e. conduct spontaneous breathing trials). – Ventilator liberation protocols are associated with extubating patients an average of 1 day earlier compared to managing patients without a protocol. Protocols to minimize sedation, mobilize patients, andliberate them from mechanical ventilation may be synergistic.

Maintain and improve physical conditioning

Provide early exercise and mobilization (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Early exercise and mobilization programs may shorten duration of mechanical ventilation, reduce ICU length of stay, lower VAP rates, and increase the rate of return to independent function.– There is no consistent association between early mobilization and hospital length of stay or mortality. Financial modeling suggests that early mobility programs may be cost saving.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^bdb849da]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Similar to other trials of early mobilisation, the recent phase III trial (the TEAM trial) randomised 750 critically ill patients from 49 hospitals across six countries and has questioned the safety of early mobilisation compared to standard care. In this trial, participants were a mixed cohort, of whom 66% had sepsis, mean body mass index was 30, 62% received vasopressors, and 22% received renal replacement therapy. Adverse events were 2.5 times more likely to occur in the intervention group compared to usual care and were more likely to reoccur in the same patients. These resolved with cessation of the early mobilisation session. Following this trial, a systematic review of the effects of early mobilisation on 6-month functional recovery was completed. It included a Bayesian analysis of the data using vague priors, and reported 75% probability that early mobilisation was associated with an increase in days alive and out of hospital at 6 months, and 95% probability that it was associated with improved physical function at 6 months. However, it was also associated with 66% chance of increased adverse events and 72% chance of increased mortality at 6 months.

Overall, usual care groups have been poorly reported in the ICU rehabilitation literature. Of the studies that have reported the activities included in usual care, the content varies considerably. Activities may include passive (no patient participation, e.g. passive range of motion), active-assisted (some participation, e.g. active-assisted range of motion), or active participation. In the TEAM trial, the usual care group reported active or active-assisted mobilisation (i.e. sitting at the edge of bed or higher) for a mean duration of 9 min per day for approximately 5 days per week, as compared to 21 min, for approximately 7 days a week, in the intervention group. Similar mobility milestones were achieved in the usual care group compared to the intervention group, but not as quickly (i.e. 1–2 days later for major mobility milestones in the usual care group) in 89% of patients, including during invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, the study by Patel and colleagues reported an improvement in cognitive function with early mobilisation compared to standard care. Standard care in this trial included only 6/99 (6%) patients who were mobilised during mechanical ventilation.

Results

Study selection

In the first stage of the literature search, we found three high-quality systematic reviews published between 2015 and 2019, through which we identified 108 references. In the second stage, the systematic update search yielded further 2,299 records, and six references were identified through bibliographies from relevant publications. Twelve studies were finally included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Figure 1 shows the study selection process and the main reasons for exclusion at the different stages.

Study characteristics

The included studies provided data from 679 people randomized to systematic early mobilization and 625 people receiving one of the comparators. We categorized two studies as comparing systematic early against late mobilization and the majority of studies (9 out of 12) as comparing systematic early against standard early mobilization. Six studies did not report information on the time from ICU admission to first mobilization in the intervention group. Information about the timing difference between intervention and comparator group was unavailable for six studies, which were thus included in the standard early mobilization category. One study was categorized as comparing systematic early mobilization against no mobilization, but contributed data to secondary outcomes reported in Additional file 3 only.

An overview of the included studies, study participant characteristics and interventions is provided in Tables 1 and 2. There was considerable heterogeneity in the baseline characteristics of participants in terms of gender, age and disease severity, both between studies and between intervention and comparator groups within studies. While most studies included a diverse mix of diagnoses, three studies focused on specific populations such as cardiothoracic surgery or sepsis patients. While interventions primarily involved physical therapy, one study additionally investigated combined physical and cognitive therapy in one of the intervention groups. Two studies involved occupational therapy and two included neuromuscular electro-stimulation. None of the studies involved speech therapy or ICU diary keeping in addition to early mobilization.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^9d7ab7d7]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) frequently suffer from ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) and lasting physical and neurocognitive impairment, resulting in difficulties in achieving full functionality in their social and professional lives. As a consequence, ICU stays are associated with a reduced quality of life as well as increased utilization of medical care, costs and mortality.

The systematic early mobilization of ICU patients is commonly advocated as an intervention to improve patient outcomes and is part of various clinical practice guidelines. There is evidence from several studies that early mobilization may improve physical function, decrease the risk of acquiring ICUAW or delirium and shorten the time to weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, some systematic reviews found no or inconclusive evidence for a benefit. It is not fully clear how the inconsistency in effects between studies arises. While heterogeneity in study populations and modality or intensity of study interventions may play a role, the timing of early mobilization has been discussed as an important factor for the effectiveness of the intervention, with earlier interventions showing greater benefit. However, the definition of standard care is not consistent between trials and may have changed over time as early mobilization was increasingly adopted in clinical practice. Thus, standard care may involve mobilization approaches that are also provided early, but less systematically. This may complicate the evaluation of the effects of early mobilization.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of systematic early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients, while explicitly considering the timing of the delivery of the comparator intervention.

### Bed rest: outdated following traumatic solid organ injury? [^652b43eb]. BMJ Military Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

This systematic review aimed to evaluate early ambulation protocols implemented for traumatic solid organ injury.

Methods

The electronic databases PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase and Cochrane Library were searched without time constraint to identify prospective and retrospective analyses, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series that investigated early ambulation in solid organ trauma.

Results

Six studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Three studies investigated early ambulation protocols in direct comparison with bed rest. The remaining three studies were early ambulation case series. In all studies there was no convincing evidence to suggest differences in clinical outcomes between early ambulation and bed rest protocols. In all studies early ambulation resulted in a reduced length of hospitalisation and decreased cost to national healthcare services.

Conclusions

This systematic review has found preliminary evidence that suggests bed rest has no clinical benefit in those with low-grade to mid-grade (grades 1–2) solid organ injury. Further studies are required to inform guidance to improve trauma patient outcomes.

### Who gets early tracheostomy? evidence of unequal treatment at 185 academic medical centers [^b38c69b0]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although the benefits of early tracheostomy in patients dependent on ventilators are well established, the reasons for variation in time from intubation to tracheostomy remain unclear. We identified clinical and demographic disparities in time to tracheostomy.

Methods

We performed a level 3 retrospective prognostic study by querying the University HealthSystem Consortium (2007–2010) for adult patients receiving a tracheostomy after initial intubation. Time to tracheostomy was designated early (< 7 days) or late (> 10 days). Cohorts were stratified by time to tracheostomy and compared using univariate tests of association and multivariable adjusted models.

Results

A total of 49,191 patients underwent tracheostomy after initial intubation: 42% early (n = 21,029) and 58% late (n = 28,162). On both univariate and multivariable analyses, women, blacks, Hispanics, and patients receiving Medicaid were less likely to receive an early tracheostomy. Patients in the early group also experienced lower rates of mortality (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.88).

Conclusions

Early tracheostomy was associated with increased survival. Yet, there were still significant disparities in time to tracheostomy according to sex, race, and type of insurance. Application of evidence-based algorithms for tracheostomy may reduce unequal treatment and improve overall mortality rates. Additional research into this apparent bias in referral/rendering of tracheostomy is needed.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines on end of life and palliative care in the intensive care unit [^1ebe62c8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Domain 3: Palliative and end-of-life care in the ICU

In ICU patients with advanced medical illnesses and deteriorating health in spite of optimal intensive care treatment, does early integration of palliative care reduce symptom distress, improve quality of life, and enhance alignment of care with patient goals?

Outcomes

Patient satisfaction.
Completion of advance care planning.
Transition to do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate.
Number of transfers to hospice care.
Patient anxiety, depression, and PTSD experience at three months.
Transition from LSTs to comfort care.
ICU length of stay.

Background

Given the high mortality among critically ill patients, palliative care must be available in ICUs. ICU HCPs as the main providers of palliative care with palliative-care consultants being called in for complex cases is the most common model. For cancer patients, early enrollment in a palliative-care program, before hospital admission, was associated with better patient and family satisfaction, fewer hospital admissions, better quality of life, and achievement of the preferred place of death. Recent studies have sought to determine whether similar benefits are obtained in ICU patients and their families.

Summary of the evidence

Three single-center low- to very-low-level evidence RCTs from the United States (US) assessed a palliative-care consultation within 3 days after ICU admission of high-risk patients (e.g. with advanced age, lifespan-limiting chronic conditions, or moderate/severe acute conditions). The ICU stay was shorter and patient satisfaction better in one trial, while the other demonstrated more transfers to hospice care and fewer ventilator days and tracheostomies, with no difference in ICU stay length. The results of seven observational studies of early palliative-care consultations or early family meetings to discuss patient goals support the findings from the RCTs.

Discussion

Most studies of early palliative-care integration for ICU patients focused on consultation with palliative-care specialists or on family meetings with ICU staff to discuss goals of care. Other components of palliative care such as symptom management and spirituality were not investigated. Only three RCTs are available and both had a single-center design that may limit general applicability. The seven observational studies also had a single-center design, and five were retrospective.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^762b3a6f]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Population

We included studies conducted in adult ICU patients (aged ≥ 18 years) requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at enrollment or during the ICU stay. We excluded studies that enrolled relevant proportions (≥ 10%) of patients with burn injuries, neurological conditions or transplant patients, as well as studies conducted in postoperative patients requiring ventilation for less than 24 h on average, as we considered these patients to have different needs or be at higher risk for adverse events than other ICU patients.

Intervention

The experimental intervention of interest was systematic early mobilization, which we defined as any physical or occupational therapy targeting muscle activation, initiated within 7 days after ICU admission and performed according to a clearly defined protocol or specific clinical criteria in all eligible patients. Neurocognitive interventions, speech therapy and ICU diary keeping were considered eligible as part of an early rehabilitation approach including systematic mobilization. Studies examining interventions primarily targeted at preventing pressure ulcers or joint stiffness, or respiratory therapy alone were not included.

Comparators

Based on a priori-defined criteria, eligible comparators were categorized as: (i) late mobilization (i.e. mobilization initiated 7 days or more after ICU admission), (ii) standard early mobilization (i.e. mobilization initiated within 7 days but less systematically, as outlined above) or (iii) no mobilization (i.e. sham intervention or no rehabilitative intervention).

Outcomes

As part of a comprehensive assessment, we prespecified multiple primary outcomes related to muscle strength and functional mobility and secondary outcomes related to quality of life, mortality, length of stay and safety (see Additional file 1). Follow-up time points considered included ICU discharge, hospital discharge, as well as 3, 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge. Out of all outcomes, the most clinically important and patient-relevant outcomes were prioritized by four ICU experts involved as stakeholders in this project without prior knowledge of the data. Here, we primarily report on these priority outcomes, which include the Medical Research Council Sum Score (MRC-SS) at ICU discharge, proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization, 6-min walk test (6MWT) performance, time needed until walking for the first time, proportion of patients returning to independence from assistance, SF-36 Physical Function Domain Score (PFS) and SF-36 Physical Health Component Summary Score (PCS) at 6 months after discharge.

### Effect of early versus late or no tracheostomy on mortality and pneumonia of critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ccfcd385]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Delay of tracheostomy for roughly 2 weeks after translaryngeal intubation of critically ill patients is the presently recommended practice and is supported by findings from large trials. However, these trials were suboptimally powered to detect small but clinically important effects on mortality. We aimed to assess the benefit of early versus late or no tracheostomy on mortality and pneumonia in critically ill patients who need mechanical ventilation.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, DOAJ, the Cochrane Library, references of relevant articles, scientific conference proceedings, and grey literature up to Aug 31, 2013, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing early tracheostomy (done within 1 week after translaryngeal intubation) with late (done any time after the first week of mechanical ventilation) or no tracheostomy and reporting on mortality or incidence of pneumonia in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality during the stay in the intensive-care unit and incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Mortality during the stay in the intensive-care unit was a composite endpoint of definite intensive-care-unit mortality, presumed intensive-care-unit mortality, and 28-day mortality. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR), pooled risk ratios (RR), and 95% CIs with a random-effects model. All but complications analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis.

Findings

Analyses of 13 trials (2434 patients, 648 deaths) showed that all-cause mortality in the intensive-care unit was not significantly lower in patients assigned to the early versus the late or no tracheostomy group (OR 0·80, 95% CI 0·59–1·09; p = 0·16). This result persisted when we considered only trials with a low risk of bias (511 deaths; OR 0·80, 95% CI 0·59–1·09; p = 0·16; eight trials with 1934 patients). Incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was lower in mechanically ventilated patients assigned to the early versus the late or no tracheostomy group (691 cases; OR 0·60, 95% CI 0·41–0·90; p = 0·01; 13 trials with 1599 patients). There was no evidence of a difference between the compared groups for 1-year mortality (788 deaths; RR 0·93, 95% CI 0·85–1·02; p = 0·14; three trials with 1529 patients).

Interpretation

The synthesised evidence suggests that early tracheostomy is not associated with lower mortality in the intensive-care unit than late or no tracheostomy. However, early, compared with late or no, tracheostomy might be associated with a lower incidence of pneumonia; a finding that could question the present practice of delaying tracheostomy beyond the first week after translaryngeal intubation in mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, the scarcity of a beneficial effect on long-term mortality and the potential complications associated with tracheostomy need careful consideration; thus, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are warranted.

Funding

None.

### 2022 Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines on prevention and management of pain, agitation, neuromuscular blockade, and delirium in critically ill pediatric patients with consideration of the ICU environment and early mobility [^37aa1a12]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Early mobility (EM) in critically ill pediatric patients — clinical outcomes: We suggest performing EM to minimize the effects of immobility in critically ill pediatric patients (conditional, low-level evidence). In a pre- and postcohort study in 75 pediatric liver transplant patients, implementation of an EM protocol was associated with earlier mobility to walk greater than 50 yards and reduced hospital LOS; an earlier analysis of 57 postprotocol liver transplantation patients reported more rapid development of functional mobility but no improvement in length of intubation, PICU stay, and hospital LOS. A small RCT, mostly focusing on feasibility and safety, found no statistical differences across multiple outcomes, including quality of life and functional scores at 6 months post discharge with a PICU EM protocol; although not statistically significant, less children in the EM protocol group were admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility following their hospital stay.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^e52d7189]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Early mobilization is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Liberation Bundle. The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared early active mobilization to usual care mobilization and found no difference in the primary outcome of days alive and out of hospital to day 180; however, it did find an increase in adverse events in the intervention group. To date, no RCT of early mobilization has reported costs or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization from the perspective of the healthcare sector.

Design:

We conducted a prospective, within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the TEAM study.

Setting:

Forty-nine ICUs in six countries (Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Brazil).

Patients:

The cost-effectiveness analysis included 733 adult ICU patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and enrolled in the TEAM study.

Interventions:

Early active mobilization or usual care mobilization

Measurements and Main Results:

A significantly higher number of hours were spent by staff in delivering high-dose early active mobilization vs. usual care mobilization; however, incremental costs were not significantly different between the groups ($1,823; 95% CI, –$10,552 to $12,027). EuroQoL-5D 5-level utility scores at 6 months were not significantly different between the groups (0.532 [, 0.021] vs. 0.548 [, 0.021]; p = 0.585). The probability of early active mobilization being cost-effective is less than 50%, even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses incorporating meta-analysis data indicated that early active mobilization may be cost-saving; however, this involves the occurrence of lower QALY gains when compared with usual care mobilization.

Conclusions:

Our trial-based analysis found no evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients; however, results from sensitivity analyses provided some evidence that it may be cost saving if one is willing to accept poorer outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine whether there are scenarios in which early active mobilization provides value for money.

### Five-year retrospective analysis of a vented mobility algorithm in the burn ICU [^71de0428]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Early mobilization with mechanically ventilated patients has received significant attention within recent literature; however, limited research has focused specifically on the burn population. The purpose of this single-center, retrospective analysis was to review the use of a burn critical care mobility algorithm, to determine the safety and feasibility of a burn vented mobility program, share limitations preventing mobility progression at our facility, and discuss unique challenges to vented mobility with intubated burn patients. A retrospective review was completed for all intubated burn center admissions between January 2015 and December 2019. Burn therapy notes were then reviewed for data collection, during the intubation period, using stages of the mobility algorithm. In the 5-year period following initial implementation, the vented mobility algorithm was utilized on 127 patients with an average TBSA of 22.8%. No adverse events occurred. Stage 1 (range of motion) was completed with 100% of patients (n = 127). Chair mode of bed, stage 2a, was utilized in 39.4% (n = 50) of patients, while 15.8% (n = 20) of patients were dependently transferred to the cardiac chair in stage 2b. Stage 3 (sitting on the edge of the bed) was completed with 25% (n = 32) of patients, with 11% (n = 14) progressing to stage 5 (standing), and 3.9% (n = 5) actively transferring to a chair. In the 5 years, only 4.7% (n = 6) reached stage 6 (ambulation). The most common treatment limitations were medical complications (33%) and line placement (21%). Early mobilization during mechanical ventilation is safe and feasible within the burn population, despite challenges, including airway stability, sedation, and line limitations.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^d2f9759c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, affordability, safety, and feasibility.

Initiating invasive ventilation based on clinical signs like fatigue and exhaustion, in combination with refractory hypoxemia, helps prioritize intubation in COVID-19 patients to the ones who really need it. However, close monitoring for worsening signs of respiratory symptoms could be a challenge in LMICs, in particular when less experienced healthcare workers have to take care of these patients in the surge of patients who need hospitalization. – When arterial blood gases are not available, the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio could be replaced by the SpO₂/FiO₂ according to well-defined formulas. – When available, intubation teams formed by skilled professionals and with predefined protocols for airway management should be considered.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend to intubate and initiate invasive ventilation based on signs of fatigue and respiratory distress more than on refractory hypoxemia alone (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
2 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend close monitoring for respiratory worsening and early intubation if worsening occurs (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend staff members to be readily available to closely monitoring a patient when an early intubation was not performed, and staff should be trained in timely recognition of respiratory distress and sign of worsening of respiratory distress (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

How to set the ventilator in COVID-19 patients in LMICs?

Rationale.

Data to support evidence-based management of invasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients remain scarce. However, an adequate ventilatory strategy is frequently associated with better outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and this should not be different in COVID-19 patients.

Search results.

We searched the databases of PubMed and Embase through Ovid until November 1, 2020. The following terms were used, either as MeSH terms or as free text words: "COVID–19" and "mechanical ventilation"

### Early mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients: a 1-day point-prevalence study in Germany [^30771bb9]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is growing evidence to support early mobilization of adult mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs. However, there is little knowledge regarding early mobilization in routine ICU practice. Hence, the interdisciplinary German ICU Network for Early Mobilization undertook a 1-day point-prevalence survey across Germany.

Design

One-day point-prevalence study.

Setting

One hundred sixteen ICUs in Germany in 2011.

Patients

All adult mechanically ventilated patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

For a 24-hour period, data were abstracted on hospital and ICU characteristics, the level of patient mobilization and associated barriers, and complications occurring during mobilization. One hundred sixteen participating ICUs provided data for 783 patients. Overall, 185 patients (24%) were mobilized out of bed (i.e., sitting on the edge of the bed or higher level of mobilization). Among patients with an endotracheal tube, tracheostomy, and noninvasive ventilation, 8%, 39%, and 53% were mobilized out of bed, respectively (p < 0.001 for difference between three groups). The most common perceived barriers to mobilizing patients out of bed were cardiovascular instability (17%) and deep sedation (15%). Mobilization out of bed versus remaining in bed was not associated with a higher frequency of complications, with no falls or extubations occurring in those mobilized out of bed.

Conclusions

In this 1-day point-prevalence study conducted across Germany, only 24% of all mechanically ventilated patients and only 8% of patients with an endotracheal tube were mobilized out of bed as part of routine care. Addressing modifiable barriers for mobilization, such as deep sedation, will be important to increase mobilization in German ICUs.

SF-36 Physical Function Domain Score

Four studies reported results on SF-36 PFS achieved by study participants at 6 months after hospital discharge. There were considerable differences between studies, as Kayambu et al. and Eggmann et al. measured higher scores than Denehy et al. and Morris et al. While Morris et al. found a statistically significant difference between the systematic early mobilization group and the late mobilization group, none of the other studies found such a difference compared with standard early mobilization. The results from three studies (287 patients) were included in a meta-analysis (Fig. 4), which showed a statistically significant improvement of SF-36 PFS at 6 months after hospital discharge in the systematic early mobilization group compared to the late mobilization group (MD 12.3; 95% CI 3.9–20.8; p = 0.004; one study; very low certainty). However, we found no evidence for such an effect for the comparison of systematic early with standard early mobilization (MD 8.1; 95% CI − 15.3 to 31.4; p = 0.50; very low certainty). Heterogeneity for the latter comparison was considerable (I² = 83.1%) due to large between-study differences in measured SF-36 PFS.

SF-36 Physical Health Component Summary Score

Out of the three studies reporting results on achieved SF-36 PCS at 6 months after hospital discharge, only Morris et al. showed a statistically significant difference between groups. When pooling data from all three studies in a meta-analysis (313 patients), there was some evidence that participants receiving systematic early mobilization achieved higher SF-36 PCS compared to those receiving late mobilization (MD 3.4; 95% CI 0.01–6.8; p = 0.050; one study; low certainty). However, there was no evidence for a difference when comparing systematic early with standard early mobilization (MD − 2.4; 95% CI − 6.1 to 1.3; p = 0.20; I² = 0.0%; low certainty).

### Benefits of early tracheotomy: a meta-analysis based on 6 observational studies [^30c281ee]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Whether early tracheotomy can improve the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients remains controversial. The current study aimed to discuss the potential benefits of early tracheotomy compared to late tracheotomy with meta-analysis of observational studies.

Methods

An electronic search (up to February 28, 2013) was conducted by a uniform requirement, and then clinical data satisfying the predefined inclusion criteria were extracted.

Results

Data from a total of 2,037 subjects were included from 6 observational retrospective studies. Meta-analysis suggested that early tracheotomy was associated with significant reductions in mortality (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.96), duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference -10.04, 95% CI -15.15 to -4.92), ICU stay (mean difference -8.80 d, 95% CI -9.71 to -7.89 d), and hospital stay (mean difference -12.18 d, 95% CI -18.25 to -6.11 d). However, as compared with late tracheotomy, early tracheotomy did not reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies suggests that early tracheotomy performed between days 3 and 7 after intubation had some advantages, including decreased mortality and reduced ICU stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation duration in ICU patients.

### Delirium in the cardiac intensive care unit [^5d393416]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Occupational therapy may also play an important role. A randomized control study showed that occupational therapy in nonintubated ICU patients reduced delirium incidence (3% versus 20%, P < 0.001). 45 Finally, a quality improvement study implementing early physical and occupational interventions along with reduced benzodiazepine use for mechanically ventilated patients in the medical ICU resulted in a reduced incidence of delirium (21% versus 53%, P = 0.003) and a reduction in hospital length of stay by 3.1 days (95% CI; 0.3–5.9 days), compared with historical rates before the interventions were implemented. 46 As described above, early mobilization is an important tool in preventing delirium, however, this can prove challenging in certain CICU patients, particularly patients with mechanical support devices and temporary pacemakers. However, just as medical ICUs have worked successfully to mobilize intubated patients, CICU's should work to increase mobility, for example by opting for mobile friendly devices such as subclavian intra‐aortic balloon pumps and active fixation temporary pacemakers when feasible.

### Evidence-based practices for acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review of reviews [^514d0b85]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the three phases that represent the continuum of care are not intended to be mutually exclusive or linear, because patients may cycle through phases. We also recognize that certain EBPs are connected directly within and across the continuum. Daily interruptions in sedation, for example, reduce complications such as delirium. Patients whose sedation is interrupted are also more likely to receive early mobility exercises and spontaneous breathing trials, which further reduces the duration of IMV, shortens ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and improves short-term mortality rates. The point that we wish to emphasize is that some EBPs perhaps should happen earlier in the process of care, either to support and facilitate the use of other EPBs or to promote safe but timely extubation in general. Thus, we propose a unified approach to the implementation of EBPs along the continuum of ARF and/or ARDS and suggest that we assess effectiveness of EBPs implemented jointly, rather than individually.

The use of a review of reviews approach, by its nature, excludes primary reports, such as important, multisite trial evidence that may recast the utility of specific practices, and change the evidence base. It is inherently a conservative approach and does not admit rapidly changing evidence. Given the difficulties inherent in the implementation EBPs in complex care settings such as ICUs, we feel it appropriate to be more conservative. The literature is growing, and the evidence-base changes in critical care. Our goal is not to be the most up to date but to provide a relatively stable platform of relevant EBPs that cover the care continuum and have the potential for implementation. In addition, we excluded non-English language systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines that were lacking sufficient resources for translation. We found few non-English language reports in our search.

### Active mobilization for mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^14bb38d4]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of active mobilization on improving physical function and hospital outcomes in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, SinoMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, other comparative studies, and case series with 10 or more consecutive cases. Additional studies were identified through references, citation tracking, and by contacting the authors of eligible studies.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently selected potential studies according to the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality.

Data Synthesis

A narrative form was used to summarize study characteristics and outcomes, because the substantial heterogeneity between the individual studies precluded formal meta-analyses. Among the 17 eligible studies, 7 RCTs, 1 quasi-RCT, 1 prospective cohort study, and 1 history controlled study were used to examine the effectiveness; and 2 RCTs, 1 prospective cohort study, and 7 case series were used to examine the safety of active mobilization in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. We found that active mobilization may improve muscle strength, functional independence, and the ability to wean from ventilation and may decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. However, only 1 study reported that active mobilization reduced the 1-year mortality rate. No serious adverse events were reported among included studies.

Conclusions

Active mobilization appears to have a positive effect on physical function and hospital outcomes in mechanical ventilation patients. Early active mobilization protocols may be initiated safely in the ICU setting and continued in post-ICU settings. However, the current available studies have great heterogeneity and limited methodologic quality. Further research is needed to provide more robust evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of active mobilization.

### Timing of intubation, beds in intensive care and inter-hospital transfer: rings of a complex chain during pandemic conditions [^2cecc9fa]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Gonzalez et al. published a prospective study focusing on timing of intubation and outcome of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The authors considered early intubation if this occurred within the first 48 h from the first respiratory support, and compared this strategy (n = 140) with a group that received delayed intubation (n = 65). The authors reported that delayed intubation caused a significant increase in hospital mortality (hazard ratio 2.4 in multivariate analysis); moreover, survivors in the delayed intubation group had worse pulmonary sequelae as evaluated by CT scan and DLCO.

These results are interesting, and other recent evidence is pointing towards benefits of early intubation in COVID-19 patients, in contrast with previous findings published by the journal. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis investigated this topic including 12 studies and almost 9000 COVID-19 patients. The pooled evidence showed a trend towards increased all-cause mortality in patients receiving early invasive mechanical ventilation (45.4%) as compared with those with late intubation (39.1%; Risk Ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.99–1.15, p = 0.08).

### Early versus late tracheostomy in critically ill patients: an umbrella review of systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials with meta-analyses and trial sequential analysis [^5b3a6f35]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critically ill patients who need prolonged mechanical ventilation, with a prevalence ranging from 10% to 20%. The rationale of a tracheostomy is that it facilitates maintenance of oral hygiene and pulmonary hygiene, improves the patient's overall comfort, simplifies the patient's mobilisation and reduces sedation. Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) regarding the ideal timing of tracheostomy have been conducted evaluating outcomes such as incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care units (ICU) and days of mechanical ventilation, and in the last five decades, a myriad of systematic reviews were published with contradictory results, leaving decision-makers uncertain how to base their conclusions.

Although a well-conducted systematic review of RCTs is considered a high rank in the evidence hierarchy, meta-analyses about tracheostomy in critically ill patients have yielded conflicting conclusions. While some meta-analyses suggest that early tracheostomy may reduce the incidence of mortality, VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilationand ICU LOS, others have found no significant differences in these outcomes. These discrepancies can be attributed to several factors, including heterogeneity in the populations studied, the absence of a standardised definition of early tracheostomy, the type and quality of studies included and variations in the outcomes assessed.

The umbrella review can reach intuitive conclusions by conducting systematic reviews with a consistent approach to variables, allowing for comprehensive analysis integrating previously published systematic reviews or meta-analyses. In this umbrella review, in order to enhance the overall quality of evidence, we focused on reviews that integrated randomised trials. Therefore, this study aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the outcomes associated with the timing of tracheostomy, while assessing potential biases and the coherence of the existing evidence base. This will be achieved through an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses encompassing RCTs.

### An official American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline: liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults. rehabilitation protocols, ventilator liberation protocols, and cuff leak tests [^c6696c5a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Interventions that lead to earlier liberation from mechanical ventilation can improve patient outcomes. This guideline, a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to optimize liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults.

Methods

Two methodologists performed evidence syntheses to summarize available evidence relevant to key questions about liberation from mechanical ventilation. The methodologists appraised the certainty in the evidence (i.e., the quality of evidence) using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and summarized the results in evidence profiles. The guideline panel then formulated recommendations after considering the balance of desirable consequences (benefits) versus undesirable consequences (burdens, adverse effects, and costs), the certainty in the evidence, and the feasibility and acceptability of various interventions. Recommendations were rated as strong or conditional.

Results

The guideline panel made four conditional recommendations related to rehabilitation protocols, ventilator liberation protocols, and cuff leak tests. The recommendations were for acutely hospitalized adults mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours to receive protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization, be managed with a ventilator liberation protocol, be assessed with a cuff leak test if they meet extubation criteria but are deemed high risk for postextubation stridor, and be administered systemic steroids for at least 4 hours before extubation if they fail the cuff leak test.

Conclusions

The American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians recommendations are intended to support healthcare professionals in their decisions related to liberating critically ill adults from mechanical ventilation.

Prevention

Central to the management of delirium is effective prevention (Figure 4), as treatment options are more limited. Nonpharmacological methods of prevention focus on minimizing the disorienting aspects of hospital care and are proven to reduce delirium in the non‐ICU setting. 39 Several studies have demonstrated that implementing a multicomponent structured approach to reorientation including: the use of clocks and calendars; daily reminders to the patient on date, time, place, and reason for hospitalization; sleep preservation by avoiding late night medication administration; early mobilization from bed; early urinary catheter removal; and use of home hearing aids and glasses may reduce the incidence and duration of delirium compared with usual care. 40, 41 Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no data have reported on how often such reorientation strategies are performed in the CICU setting.

Figure 4
Preventative strategies for delirium.

Balas et al, implemented the combination of awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management and early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle in intubated ICU patients. In this pre‐post comparison, a 50% decrease in the odds of delirium was reported (OR 0.55, P = 0.03). 42 Note that "awakening and breathing coordination" refers to frequent use of spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials. In addition, several trials have demonstrated that physical and occupational therapy decrease delirium in the ICU. One group demonstrated that when early rehabilitation interventions were performed during daily interruption of sedation the median duration of delirium was 2.0 days compared with 4.0 days without rehabilitation (P = 0.02). 43 Similar results were reported in a study randomizing mechanically ventilated surgical ICU patients to early mobilization versus standard therapy. 44

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ffdb945f]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

MRC Sum Score

Five studies reported on MRC-SS at ICU discharge. Four studies found no statistically significant difference between systematic early mobilization and late mobilization or standard early mobilization. Dantas et al. reported a statistically significantly higher MRC-SS in favor of systematic early mobilization compared with standard early mobilization. However, the mean MRC-SS of participants in the systematic early mobilization group was already higher at baseline compared to the comparator group. Meta-analysis including data from four studies (203 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in MRC-SS at ICU discharge between systematic early mobilization and standard early mobilization (MD 5.8 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 1.4 to 13.0; p = 0.12; I² = 81.7%; very low certainty; Fig. 3). In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded the study by Dantas et al. due to the baseline imbalance in MRC-SS, which may have affected their results. We found no evidence for a between-group difference in this analysis (MD 2.2; 95% CI − 2.5 to 6.9; p = 0.36; I² = 41.2%; low certainty).

Fig. 3
Meta-analysis results on MRC Sum Scores at ICU discharge and proportion of patients developing ICU-acquired weakness during hospitalization

Proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization

While four studies published results on the proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization, none of these found a statistically significantly lower rate of ICUAW in the systematic early mobilization group compared to late mobilization or standard early mobilization groups. A meta-analysis of all four studies (499 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of ICUAW between groups (Fig. 3). However, the effects may be clinically meaningful, with a 38% reduction in the risk for developing ICUAW for systematic early mobilization compared with late mobilization (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38–1.02; p = 0.06; I² = 0.0%; one study; low certainty), and a 10% risk reduction for systematic early compared with standard early mobilization (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.63–1.27; p = 0.54; I² = 33.3%; very low certainty).

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^8fad924d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Physical conditioning — early mobility recommends to provide early exercise and mobilization (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE); early exercise and mobilization programs may shorten duration of mechanical ventilation, reduce ICU length of stay, lower VAP rates, and increase the rate of return to independent function, with no consistent association between early mobilization and hospital length of stay or mortality, and financial modeling suggests that early mobility programs may be cost saving.

### Early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU: moving back to the future [^d6f760b6]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the historical precedent of mobilizing critically ill patients, bed rest is common practice in ICUs worldwide, especially for mechanically ventilated patients. ICU-acquired weakness is an increasingly recognized problem, with sequelae that may last for months and years following ICU discharge. The combination of critical illness and bed rest results in substantial muscle wasting during an ICU stay. When initiated shortly after the start of mechanical ventilation, mobilization and rehabilitation can play an important role in decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay and improving patients' return to functional independence. This review summarizes recent evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and benefits of early mobilization and rehabilitation of mechanically ventilated patients and presents a brief summary of future directions for this field.

### Factors for success of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^4ff00c25]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 require hospitalization and oxygen support due to progressive respiratory failure. Intubation rate varies from 15 to 85% and is a major concern in the regions with the highest mortality due to the unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems. Prone positioning is standard care for intubated patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with the physiological benefits of improving lung heterogeneity and aeration, which ultimately lead to improved survival.

Considering the potentially similar physiological mechanism, awake prone positioning (APP) has been broadly applied for non-intubated patients with COVID-19 since the early pandemic. However, despite the wide adoption of this maneuver and its recommendation in the updated National Institutes of Health Guidelines, there is scarce evidence regarding early predictors of success and sufficient monitoring of clinical response after initiation of APP; such data might help select the patients who will benefit the most, and early identify those with inadequate response, avoiding unnecessary delay in escalation of care.

We designed this multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial (NCT04477655) to assess the potential for APP, as compared to standard care, to reduce the need for intubation and invasive ventilation of patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Shortly after initiation of the trial, we joined a consortium of five other national multicenter trials to establish a collaborative prospective meta-trial, with the advantage of more rapidly determining the effectiveness of APP in patients with severe COVID-19, a key priority given the pandemic situation. This consortium recently published the strongest available evidence in favor of APP, but only the outcomes that were common across all trials were reported, including baseline characteristics, APP duration, and outcomes (28-day intubation rate and mortality). As prospectively defined, this paper reports additional data prospectively collected in our trial that were not reported in the meta-trial publication and are important to understanding how to maximize the therapeutic potential of APP by identifying the factors associated with APP success.

### Early mobilization in the ICU and diabetes: a bittersweet concoction? [^ffdbb9c4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although mortality rates due to critical illness have decreased during the past several decades as a result of improvements in clinical care in the ICU, as many as two thirds of survivors experience one or more persistent impairments as part of a post–intensive care syndrome (PICS), which manifests as physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments for years after hospitalization. Prolonged immobility in the ICU is a key independent risk factor for the acquisition of muscle and nerve disease during critical illness, referred to as ICU-acquired weakness, which leads to the long-term physical impairments seen in PICS and ultimately disability. To reduce the profound insults of critical illness on skeletal muscle and physical function, early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU has been studied as a PICS prevention strategy. Notably, early mobility has been shown to yield a 19% absolute risk reduction in cognitive impairment at 1 year in ICU survivors after mechanical ventilation in a recent single-center trial, in addition to reducing ICU-acquired weakness at 1 year. Although studies of early mobility performed ⩾72 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation have not shown benefit, trials initiating early mobility within 72 hours have demonstrated improved outcomes, including better functional status before hospital discharge and reductions in ICU-acquired weakness in survivors. However, these trials left several unanswered questions about the optimal timing and "dose" of early mobility.

The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults with Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized trial, published in 2022, was an international multicenter randomized controlled trial that randomized 750 mechanically ventilated adults to receive increased early mobilization versus usual care to investigate the optimal dose of early mobility in the ICU. To put this trial into context with earlier trials, patients in both arms were enrolled an average of approximately 80 hours after admission to the hospital, and the intervention group received approximately 21 minutes of early mobility compared to approximately 9 minutes in the control group. In comparison with usual care, the trial found no improvement from the intervention on the primary outcome, which was the number of days alive and out of the hospital at Day 180. Similarly, no benefit to early mobility was seen for secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life and disability at 180 days. In contrast, there was a signal of an increased number of adverse events in the early mobility treatment group. The TEAM trial was a landmark study in the realm of early mobility trials and generated important additional questions about identifying responders to ICU rehabilitation.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU: 2023 [^0e9d0d8b]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guideline methodology for recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU notes that rapid response systems (RRSs) have been used but there is uncertainty over which components provide measurable benefits, and the clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for early recognition of at-risk non-ICU patients and prompt mobilization of resources. Panel composition included a panel of 25 experts including a patient/family representative, with methodological leadership by the GUIDE group represented by two clinician-methodologists based on the GRADE methodology. Conflicts of interest were disclosed and managed per ACCM/SCCM procedures. The panel formulated actionable population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICOs) questions related to early recognition and response outside the ICU and prioritized outcomes for patient-importance; a professional librarian conducted a systematic search, and reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias according to standard systematic review methodology. Where possible the group performed meta-analysis using random effects models and inverse variance weighting, otherwise evidence was summarized narratively. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE and evidence profiles were generated with the GRADEPro Guideline Development Tool. For recommendation formulation, the panel used the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework and, when the benefits unequivocally outweighed harms, generated good practice statements that are considered equivalent to strong recommendations.

### Association of early in-hospital endotracheal intubation with clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic coma: a multicenter observational study [^67612d94]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussions

In this analysis of 11,927 patients from 96 hospitals, high rates of noncompliance and practice variation were observed regarding guidelines recommending immediate airway intubation for patients with trauma and a GCS score < 8. Hospitals with higher endotracheal intubation rates had significantly better favorable neurological outcome rates at hospital discharge compared to those with lower intubation rates; however, the correlation with survival outcomes was insignificant.

Our findings contribute to evidence supporting guidelines recommending immediate intubation for patients with a GCS score < 8 following trauma. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and robust analysis examining the relationship between endotracheal intubation practices and outcomes in this population. Considering that the potential benefit of immediate intubation for comatose patients with trauma is to prevent secondary brain injury through adequate oxygenation and ventilation, our findings demonstrate that better neurological outcomes with higher intubation rates are plausible.

The median adherence rate in this study was 67.9%, consistent with the previously reported range of 61.1%–68.4%. Reasons for noncompliance with guidelines recommending immediate intubation for comatose patients with trauma are likely multifactorial. Physicians may not follow guideline recommendations owing to a lack of direct evidence for the clinical benefits of immediate intubation. Inadequate training or resource limitations may also contribute to delays or failures in performing intubation. Regional variations in medical practice and physician risk aversion may further limit the practice in certain hospitals.

The observed hospital-level association between immediate intubation and favorable neurological outcomes supports using the event "GCS score < 8 and no endotracheal tube or surgical airway performed before leaving the resuscitation area" as a quality indicator in the QI process. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Hospitals with higher intubation rates may also have stronger trauma systems — experienced staff, dedicated trauma teams, and better access to ICU and surgical care — all of which have independent effects on outcomes. The lack of association in the patient-level analysis suggests that system-level factors, rather than intubation itself, may explain the observed benefit. Further studies are needed to clarify the causal effect of early intubation on neurological outcomes.

### Pragmatic approach to mobilizing individuals with critical illness due to COVID-19: clinical perspective [^7f3b7b36]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide pragmatic guidance for acute rehabilitation management and implementation of early mobility for individuals with critical illness due to COVID-19.

Methods

Clinical perspective developed through reflective clinical practice and narrative review of best available evidence.

Results

Current clinical practice guidelines do not provide guidance for implementation of early mobility interventions for individuals with critical illness due to COVID-19 who require enhanced ventilatory support or support of inhaled pulmonary artery vasodilators. Many individuals who may benefit from implementation of early mobility interventions are excluded by strict interpretation of current guidelines.

Conclusions

Risk vs benefit of implementing early mobility interventions in individuals with critical illness due to COVID-19 can be mitigated through coordinated efforts of interdisciplinary teams to promote shared decision-making through therapeutic alliances with patients and their families. Clinicians must clearly define the goals of care, understand the limitations of monitoring equipment in the intensive care unit, prepare to titrate levels of oxygen based on an individual's physiologic response to mobility interventions, and help individuals maintain external goal-directed focus of attention to optimize outcomes of early mobility interventions.

### Prevalence of acute rehabilitation for kids in the PICU: a Canadian multicenter point prevalence study [^21ca5950]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate mobilization practices, barriers, and mobility-related adverse events in Canadian PICUs.

Design

National 2-day point prevalence study.

Setting

Thirteen PICUs across Canada.

Patients

Children with a minimum 72-hour PICU length of stay on the allocated study day.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Outcomes of interest were the prevalence and nature of mobilization activities, rehabilitation resources, adverse events, and factors associated with out-of-bed mobility and therapist-provided mobility. Two PICUs (15%) had early mobilization practice guidelines, and one PICU (8%) reported a formal process for engaging families in the mobilization of patients. The prevalence of mobilization was 110 of 137 patient-days (80%). The commonest activity was out-of-bed mobility (87/137; 64% patient-days); there was no active mobilization on 46 patient-days (34%). Therapists provided mobility on 33% of patient-days. Mobility was most commonly facilitated by nurses (74% events) and family (49% events). Family participation was strongly associated with out-of-bed mobility (odds ratio 6.4; p = 0.001). Intubated, mechanically ventilated patients were mobilized out-of-bed on 18 of 50 patient-days (36%). However, the presence of an endotracheal tube, vasoactive infusions, and age greater than or equal to 3 years were independently associated with not being mobilized out-of-bed. Barriers were reported on 58 of 137 patient-days (42%), and adverse events occurred in 22 of 387 mobility events (6%).

Conclusions

Mobilization is common and safe, and the majority of children in Canadian PICUs are being mobilized out-of-bed, even when mechanically ventilated. Family engagement in PICU-based rehabilitation is increasing. This study provides encouraging evidence that common barriers can be overcome in order to safely mobilize children in PICUs.

### Guideline on multimodal rehabilitation for patients with post-intensive care syndrome [^da9cbb73]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Early mobilization

Research question Does early mobilization of critically ill patients reduce the incidence or duration of PICS?

Recommendation 1 Early mobilization ought to be started within the first few days in the ICU, depending on the patient's resilience and general condition.

Therapy Option 1: Supplemental use of ergometers (bed cycling) in addition to early mobilization can be considered.

Rationale Mobilization is an energy-consuming process aimed at maintaining and promoting a person's mobility. Early mobilization is started within 72 h after admission and intensified during the stay in ICU. Various methods of early mobilization can be performed with different approaches, including passive mobilization (bed mobility, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)), assisted exercises (bed cycling, robotics, functional exercises, resistance exercises, transfers), active exercises (active exercises, activities of daily living, walking), or other exercises, e.g. cognitive exercises. Early mobilization is generally recommended during the stay on ICU, as it can have positive effects on the duration of ventilation and length of stay, delirium incidence, and muscle strength at the time of discharge. Although early mobilization in the ICU does not seem to have a significant effect on long-term physical, functional, cognitive, or psychosocial outcome compared to usual care, short-term effects such as reduction of mechanical ventilation and length of stay or delirium frequency in the ICU can be demonstrated. These issues are highly relevant for patients and families. Therefore, we recommend structured, interprofessional implementation of early mobilization of critically ill patients according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria with the best possible dosage and frequency.

Summary of recommendations for acutely hospitalized adults ventilated ≥ 24 h — For acutely hospitalized patients ventilated for more than 24 h, we suggest protocols attempting to minimize sedation (Conditional; Low certainty in the evidence). For patients at high risk for extubation failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h and who have passed an SBT, we recommend extubation to preventive NIV (Strong; Moderate certainty in the evidence). For acutely hospitalized patients who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 h, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (Conditional; Low certainty in the evidence). We suggest managing acutely hospitalized patients who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 h with a ventilator liberation protocol (Conditional; Low certainty in the evidence). We suggest performing a CLT in mechanically ventilated adults who meet extubation criteria and are deemed at high risk for PES (Conditional; Very low certainty in the evidence). For adults who have failed a CLT but are otherwise ready for extubation, we suggest administering systemic steroids at least 4 h before extubation; a repeated CLT is not required (Conditional; Moderate certainty in the evidence). Abbreviations: CLT = cuff leak test; NIV = noninvasive ventilation; PES = postextubation stridor; SBT = spontaneous breathing trial.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^be969a27]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Early rehabilitation in acute respiratory failure emphasizes assessment and safe mobilization by an interdisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) team. Although survival in critically ill individuals, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has improved, this is often associated with generalized deconditioning, functional impairment, and reduced health-related quality of life after ICU discharge, indicating the need for rehabilitation after ICU and hospital discharge and for measures during ICU stay to prevent or attenuate deconditioning. Clinical interest and scientific evidence have given support to safe and early physical activity and mobilization in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Planning early mobilization involves assessment of cooperation, cardiopulmonary reserve, muscle strength, joint mobility, functional status, and quality of life; muscle strength assessment is important for guiding progressive ambulation and predicting outcomes. In alert ICU patients, strength can be measured with the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea grade, handgrip dynamometer, and handheld dynamometer, while in unconscious individuals muscle thickness by ultrasound is available as a nonvalidated test. Several protocols address safety, cardiorespiratory and neurologic status, cooperation level, and functional status, and provide steps to gradually increase activity and mobilization in the critically ill.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for weaning from mechanical ventilation, more specifically with respect to rehabilitation, ACCP/ATS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization in acutely hospitalized adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^9557e6c8]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Early mobilization is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Liberation Bundle. The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared early active mobilization to usual care mobilization and found no difference in the primary outcome of days alive and out of hospital to day 180; however, it did find an increase in adverse events in the intervention group. To date, no RCT of early mobilization has reported costs or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization from the perspective of the healthcare sector.

Design

We conducted a prospective, within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the TEAM study.

Setting

Forty-nine ICUs in six countries (Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Brazil).

Patients

The cost-effectiveness analysis included 733 adult ICU patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and enrolled in the TEAM study.

Interventions

Early active mobilization or usual care mobilization.

Measurements and Main Results

A significantly higher number of hours were spent by staff in delivering high-dose early active mobilization vs. usual care mobilization; however, incremental costs were not significantly different between the groups ($1,823; 95% CI, -$10,552 to $12,027). EuroQoL-5D 5-level utility scores at 6 months were not significantly different between the groups (0.532 [se, 0.021] vs. 0.548 [se, 0.021]; p = 0.585). The probability of early active mobilization being cost-effective is less than 50%, even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses incorporating meta-analysis data indicated that early active mobilization may be cost-saving; however, this involves the occurrence of lower QALY gains when compared with usual care mobilization.

Conclusions

Our trial-based analysis found no evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients; however, results from sensitivity analyses provided some evidence that it may be cost saving if one is willing to accept poorer outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine whether there are scenarios in which early active mobilization provides value for money.

Early rehabilitation in the ICU: future directions

Novel rehabilitation technology, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and cycle ergometry, may provide an opportunity for early rehabilitation even when the patient is unable to actively participate (for example, during acute phase of critical illness). In healthy volunteers, NMES can improve or preserve muscle strength by preventing disuse atrophy through stimulated muscle contraction, but there are limited data in the critically ill. In a study of mechanically ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), those randomized to NMES with physical therapy had improved muscle strength at 28 days and decreased number of days needed to transfer from bed to chair as compared to physical therapy alone. Cycle ergometry, another novel rehabilitation tool can provide passive, active-assisted, or active range of motion exercises. In a recent study of ninety critically ill patients, those randomized to cycle ergometry showed improvements in quadriceps muscle function, 6-minute walk distance, and self-reported physical functioning at hospital discharge. These promising results require confirmation in large, prospective clinical trials.

Enforced bedrest, oversedation, and delirium are common barriers to early rehabilitation in the ICU. Sedation and analgesia are commonly instituted (with or without neuromuscular blockade) in the ICU for management of patient discomfort, anxiety, and asynchrony during mechanical ventilation. Changes in sedation strategies, including novel sedative agents such as dexmedetomidine, use of intermittent sedation, or no sedation may help to limit oversedation and delirium in the ICU and improve patient wakefulness and availability for physical therapy.

Even more radical might be finding a viable alternative to mechanical ventilation in which sedation and analgesia use can truly be minimized. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become an area of increasing interest following its successful use for H1N1-associated ARDS. By providing extracorporeal gas exchange support, ECMO may mitigate the need for any aggressive mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. Indeed, a number of groups have exploited this technology to facilitate rehabilitation and ambulation in ICU patients awaiting lung transplantation. As this technology continues to improve and miniaturize, it is conceivable that mechanical ventilation could eventually be replaced by ECMO, allowing our critically ill patients to be awake, calm, cooperative, and mobile.
