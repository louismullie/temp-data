## Question

What is What is PT INR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what PT/INR is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definitions of PT and INR and how they relate. Then, I should verify the historical rationale for INR standardization and the ISI concept. Next, I will examine the clinical applications, especially warfarin monitoring, and the usual therapeutic ranges. After that, I need to check limitations and pitfalls, including early warfarin therapy, liver disease, and DOACs. I will then review point-of-care testing and quality assurance. Finally, I should consider special populations and procedures, and synthesize a concise, clinically useful takeaway with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the basics: PT is the prothrombin time, a clotting assay of the extrinsic and common pathways, and INR is the International Normalized Ratio, a calculated value that standardizes PT across laboratories so that warfarin monitoring is comparable everywhere; the formula is INR = [patient PT/mean normal PT]ᴵˢᴵ, where ISI is the International Sensitivity Index of the thromboplastin reagent used locally.

> Wait, let me verify the historical rationale before moving on: PT in seconds varies widely between labs because different thromboplastins have different sensitivities, so the INR system was adopted in the 1980s to normalize warfarin effect reporting; this is why INR is the standard for VKA therapy rather than raw PT seconds or simple PT ratios, and it remains the cornerstone for dose titration and safety monitoring in warfarin-treated patients [^112QHUn4].

> I should confirm the clinical use cases next: for vitamin K antagonists like warfarin, INR is used to titrate to a therapeutic window, typically INR 2.0–3.0 for most indications, with mechanical heart valves often requiring 2.5–3.5; outside VKA therapy, PT/INR can help screen for extrinsic/common pathway factor deficiencies or liver disease, but it was not designed for DOAC monitoring and should not be used for that purpose [^112pnh2G] [^112Fp2To].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal applicability; I need to check limitations carefully: during the first few days of warfarin, INR is driven largely by factor VII decline (short half-life) and may not reflect the full anticoagulant effect, so early INR can be misleading; in cirrhosis, INR reflects reduced synthesis of both pro- and anticoagulant factors and does not reliably predict bleeding risk, and attempts to "correct" INR with plasma often do not improve hemostasis; for DOACs, PT/INR is insensitive or variably affected and should not be used to quantify effect, where anti-Xa assays or dilute thrombin time are preferred when needed [^114o8aje] [^112Fp2To].

> Let me consider point-of-care testing and quality assurance, because clinicians often ask about home INR devices; POC monitors correlate reasonably with lab INR in warfarin patients, but performance varies by device and reagent, and external quality control is important; I should double-check that independent ISI calibration improves agreement, and yes, multicenter data show reduced bias after calibration, though inter-device variability can persist without QA programs [^112UxWp7] [^116oibRD] [^113Kunb7].

> Next, I should review special populations and procedures; in pediatrics, reference intervals and device performance differ, so pediatric-specific validation is needed; in trauma, early PT/INR helps characterize traumatic coagulopathy and guide resuscitation, but I need to ensure we integrate with fibrinogen and viscoelastic testing rather than relying on PT/INR alone; for procedures in cirrhosis, very low platelet counts predict bleeding better than INR, and routine plasma to "correct" INR is discouraged unless there is active bleeding or a high-risk invasive procedure [^113wq5Kf] [^114MhbJT] [^112NQZsq] [^117AcC7a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied INR directly measures bleeding risk; I should correct that: INR is a surrogate of factor activity and anticoagulant effect, not a direct bleeding predictor, and patients can bleed within the therapeutic INR range while others with elevated INR may not, underscoring the need to integrate clinical context, platelet count, fibrinogen, and procedural risk when making decisions [^117AcC7a] [^112iKb8B].

> I will now examine practical pitfalls that can distort INR: underfilled citrate tubes, wrong citrate concentration, lupus anticoagulant, and failure to locally validate ISI and mean normal PT can all yield spurious INR results; I should confirm best practices such as using 3.2% citrate, adequate fill volumes, and local ISI calibration to mitigate these issues [^113B9zZj] [^112rg8jE].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful takeaway: PT/INR is a standardized PT-derived metric designed for warfarin monitoring and cross-lab comparability; it remains indispensable for VKA management with typical targets of 2.0–3.0, but it is not a universal coagulopathy test and should not be used to monitor DOACs, to predict bleeding in liver disease, or to justify routine plasma transfusion in nonbleeding patients with mild INR elevations; use alternative assays when appropriate, apply QA for POC use, and always interpret results in clinical context [^112Fp2To] [^114o8aje] [^112QHUn4].

PT/INR is a **standardized measure of blood clotting time**, with PT as the raw clotting time and INR as a calculated ratio that adjusts for lab variability [^112ML7w1]. It is used to monitor warfarin therapy, assess bleeding risk, and guide procedures; typical therapeutic INR is 2.0–3.0, and INR > 4.5 increases bleeding risk [^1174t4EA]. INR is **not reliable for DOACs** [^112Fp2To] and may be misleading in liver disease [^114o8aje]; results can be affected by drugs, diet, and lab methods, so confirm unexpected values and use clinical judgment [^111E4m8c].

---

## Definition and calculation

- **PT**: Time to clot formation after adding tissue factor and calcium to plasma; reflects extrinsic and common pathways (factors I, II, V, VII, X) [^112wY5Jo].

- **INR**: Standardized PT ratio: INR = [patient PT/mean normal PT]ᴵˢᴵ, where ISI reflects thromboplastin sensitivity [^112ML7w1].

- **Purpose**: INR normalizes PT across labs, enabling consistent warfarin monitoring [^112iKb8B].

---

## Clinical significance

PT/INR is **central to warfarin management** and procedural planning:

- **Warfarin monitoring**: Therapeutic INR is usually 2.0–3.0; adjust dose to maintain this range [^114VPRmo].

- **Bleeding risk**: INR > 4.5 increases bleeding risk; manage with dose reduction or vitamin K [^1174t4EA].

- **Procedural guidance**: INR helps assess bleeding risk and need for reversal or transfusion before procedures [^115eu1cT].

---

## Factors influencing PT/INR

Several factors can **alter PT/INR**:

| **Factor category** | **Examples** | **Effect on PT/INR** |
|-|-|-|
| Medications | - Warfarin <br/> - Antibiotics (e.g. fluoroquinolones) <br/> - Capecitabine <br/> - Daptomycin | Increase PT/INR |
| Diet | - Vitamin K intake <br/> - Alcohol | Alters PT/INR |
| Liver disease | - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatitis | Prolongs PT/INR |
| Laboratory methods | - Thromboplastin sensitivity <br/> - ISI calibration | Affects INR accuracy [^111E4m8c] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **DOACs**: PT/INR is unreliable for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban; use anti-Xa or dilute thrombin time when needed [^112Fp2To] [^1138CBSF].

- **Liver disease**: PT/INR reflects both pro- and anticoagulant deficiencies and may not predict bleeding risk; interpret cautiously [^114o8aje] [^117AcC7a].

- **Variability**: Lab methods and reagents can affect INR; confirm unexpected results and consider clinical context [^112fr4VB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Therapeutic range**: Most indications target INR 2.0–3.0; mechanical valves may require 2.5–3.5 [^114VPRmo].

- **Monitoring frequency**: Frequent INR checks are recommended during warfarin initiation and with interacting drugs or diet changes [^114cRU6Q] [^116u4vRe] [^112wY5Jo].

- **Management of elevated INR**: Use vitamin K or PCC for rapid reversal when indicated [^1174t4EA] [^116pGfxo].

---

PT/INR is a **standardized clotting test** used to monitor warfarin, assess bleeding risk, and guide procedures, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of drug, dietary, and laboratory influences.

### The historical origins of modern international normalized ratio targets [^112QHUn4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) and its derivative international normalized ratio (INR) are frequently ordered to assess the coagulation system. Plasma transfusion to treat incidentally abnormal PT/INR is a common practice with low biological plausibility and without credible evidence, yet INR targets appear in major clinical guidelines and account for the majority of plasma use at many institutions. In this article, we review the historical origins of INR targets. We recount historical milestones in the development of the PT, discovery of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), motivation for INR standardization, and justification for INR targets in patients receiving VKA therapy. Next, we summarize evidence for INR testing to assess bleeding risk in patients not on VKA therapy and plasma transfusion for treating mildly abnormal INR to prevent bleeding in these patients. We conclude with a discussion of the parallels in misunderstanding of historic PT and present-day INR testing with lessons from the past that might help rationalize plasma transfusion in the future.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^112rg8jE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The relevance of the INR for VKA-treated patients

The INR is a standardised method for reporting results of the PT assay, which is sensitive to the coagulation factors prothrombin, tissue factor and factors V, VII and X. As these coagulation factors depend on vitamin K for synthesis, the INR reflects anticoagulation owing to warfarin. For a warfarin-anticoagulated patient, the INR can aid decision-making around the measures that may be needed to normalise coagulation activity and stop or stabilise bleeding.

Elevated INRs can arise from direct overdosing, as well as interactions between warfarin and numerous other drugs or herbal remedies, as the result of fluctuations in dietary vitamin K owing to dietary changes or intake of nutritional supplements, or as a consequence of alcohol abuse. Concurrent conditions, such as hepatic or biliary disease, gastrointestinal illness or sepsis also can increase the INR. In such situations, the cause of the elevation needs to be identified so that repeated incidents and the resultant increased bleeding risk can be avoided. In the event of a self-reported and/or unexplained elevation in INR, retesting in the ED can confirm the elevation and exclude erroneous results. However, in the ED itself, testing artefacts such as under filling tubes when drawing blood for INR testing can yield falsely elevated INR results owing to excess levels of citrate in the test sample. Errors can be avoided by use of the correct sample tubes and ensuring that they are adequately filled.

Finally, patients are treated with warfarin to manage thrombosis or reduce the risk of stroke or other thromboembolic events. Therefore, when a VKA-treated patient presents at the ED, the INR should be confirmed to be in the therapeutic range, and intervention may be required when it is not. If necessary, the patient should be referred for appropriate warfarin management on discharge.

### Home prothrombin time monitoring: a literature analysis [^114cRU6Q]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

The anticoagulant activity of warfarin sodium is monitored by the prothrombin time (PT) using the international normalized ratio (INR). Standard oral anticoagulant therapy monitoring requires frequent patient visits to physicians' offices and/or laboratories to optimize warfarin dosage. Home PT monitoring by patients can increase testing frequency and may thus decrease complications associated with oral anticoagulant therapy. Clinical studies suggest that home PT monitoring is more effective than uncoordinated management and is as effective as care through specialized anticoagulation clinics for keeping INRs within a therapeutic range. There are accurate and reliable instruments available, but paramount to the success of home PT monitoring is sound patient selection, appropriate patient training, and consistent quality control.

### Fiix-prothrombin time versus standard prothrombin time for monitoring of warfarin anticoagulation: a single centre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^114cRvMJ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid fluctuations in factor VII during warfarin anticoagulation change the international normalised ratio (INR) but contribute little to the antithrombotic effect. We aimed to assess non-inferiority of anticoagulation stabilisation with a warfarin monitoring method affected only by factors II and X (Fiix-prothrombin time [Fiix-PT]) compared with standard PT-INR monitoring that includes factor VII measurement as well.

Methods

The Fiix trial was a single centre, double-blind, prospective, non-inferiority, randomised controlled clinical trial. Ambulatory adults on warfarin with an INR target of 2–3 managed by an anticoagulation dosing service using software-assisted dosing at the National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, were eligible for inclusion in this study. We excluded patients undergoing electroconversion and nursing home residents. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the Fiix-PT monitoring group or the PT monitoring group by block randomisation. A blinded research INR (R-INR) based on results of the respective test was reported to the dosing staff. Participants were contacted by a study nurse at 4-week intervals to elicit information about thromboembolism or bleeding otherwise unknown to the anticoagulation management centre. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of objectively diagnosed non-fatal and fatal arterial or venous thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction and transient ischaemic attacks, assessed in all eligible patients who were randomised (intention-to-monitor population). The safety endpoint was major bleeding or other clinically relevant bleeding, assessed in the per-protocol population. We assumed a 3% annual thromboembolism incidence and a non-inferiority margin of 2.5%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01565239.

Findings

Between March 1, 2012, and Feb 28, 2014, we enrolled 1156 patients. 573 patients were assigned to Fiix-PT and 575 to PT-INR monitoring after exclusion of four patients from each group for various reasons. Median follow-up was 1.7 years (IQR 1.1–1.9). During days 1–720, ten (1.2% per patient year) thromboembolic events occurred in the Fiix-PT group versus 19 (2.3% per patient year) in the PT group (relative risk [RR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.25–1.13; pnon-inferiority < 0.0001). Major bleeding occurred in 17 of 571 patients in the Fiix group (2.2% per patient year) versus 20 of 573 patients in the PT group (2.5% per patient year; RR 0.85, 0.45–1.61; pnon-inferiority = 0.0034). Anticoagulation stability was improved with Fiix-PT monitoring as manifested by fewer tests, fewer dose adjustments, increased time in range and less INR variability than reported with standard PT monitoring.

Interpretation

Monitoring of warfarin with Fiix-PT improved anticoagulation and dosing stability and was clinically non-inferior to PT monitoring. Results from this trial suggest that during vitamin K antagonist treatment INR monitoring could be replaced by Fiix-PT and that this would lead to at least a non-inferior clinical outcome compared with monitoring with PT-INR.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^114o8aje]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guideline on coagulation disorders in cirrhosis — background and conceptual framework states that cirrhosis is accompanied by alterations in platelet count (PLT) and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) used to estimate clotting, but it has become clear that neither thrombocytopenia nor elevated PT/INR predicts bleeding outcomes in most patients and that the severity of coagulopathy by these parameters is not predictive of bleeding complications, including variceal hemorrhage. The text also describes that patients are at risk for thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, or stroke), notes clinician trepidation treating with conventional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and cautions that PT/INR-based strategies to estimate bleeding risk and monitor VKA endpoints may not be relevant in cirrhosis; more integrative approaches using measurements of fibrin clot formation and lysis have been tested.

### Inaccuracy of international normalized ratio (INR) measurements and suggestions for improved WHO guidelines for calibration of reference preparations – a statistical study [^116P7gVu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous empirical studies show that the accuracy of international normalized ratio (INR) measurements is unsatisfactory and worse than generally expected. We demonstrate that a plausible reason for this large inaccuracy is a conventional calibration procedure of reference preparations with (i) an erroneous assumption that the line relating logarithmic prothrombin times (log PTs) of patients passes through the mean log PT of the 'normal' population (mean normal PT); (ii) non-perceived interactions between patients and PT systems; and (iii) systematic exclusions of 'outliers'. The same conventional procedure also results in serious overestimation of the accuracy of INR measurements, thus leading to a false sense of security in oral anticoagulant therapy. In an example with data from WHO guidelines, we show that the systematic overprediction of INR (which is believed to be 0) may be as large as 5%, when prediction is performed under the conventional WHO model. Under the same model the CV of the predicted vs. the true INR is believed to be only about 1% when it in reality is more than 4%. We suggest that the conventional calibration procedure is modified in order to reduce the twofold negative impact of lower true accuracy and overestimated reported accuracy on oral anticoagulant therapy and to allow for an unambiguous definition of true INR values.

### Simplified method for local correction of system international normalized ratio [^113qu76k]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

International normalized ratio (INR) derivation is dependent on the international sensitivity index (ISI) of thromboplastin. It varies with instrument and reagents used.

Objective

To evaluate the role of a correction factor in the derivation of INR.

Methods

We studied prothrombin time (PT) and INR from patients using 3 thromboplastins of varying ISI values. The correction factor was applied to the observed INR to obtain a corrected INR.

Results

The difference between corrected INR and observed INR values varies from -0.8 through 0.96.

Conclusions

Corrected INR is dependent on PT only. It can be applied to all patients irrespective of cause for elevated PT.

### REDucing unnecessary coagulation testing in the emergency department (REDUCED) [^114rLy8L]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Problem

The PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) blood test was developed in the 1930s and validated for warfarin monitoring. The aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) was developed in the 1940s to screen for hemophilia in high-risk individuals and later validated for heparin monitoring. Despite these specific indications, both tests are often ordered 'routinely' as 'coagulation' tests.

The SMART AIM of our study was to reduce PT/INR and aPTT blood testing in the emergency department (ED) over a 12-month period using an iterative quality improvement strategy.

### A modified international normalized ratio as an effective way of prothrombin time standardization in hepatology [^111vLPxf]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

International Normalized Ratio (INR), which standardizes prothrombin time (PT) during oral anticoagulation, has been extended to standardize PT in liver diseases and is included in prognostic models such as the Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD). However, mechanisms of PT prolongation in liver diseases differ from those involved in oral anticoagulation, and the thromboplastin reagents differ in their sensitivities to these 2 mechanisms. Our aim was to determine whether, in the calibration model for thromboplastins proposed by the World Health Organization, the use of plasmas from patients with liver diseases instead of plasmas from patients on oral anticoagulation could lead to a new INR specific for liver diseases (INR "LD"), achieving a real standardization of PT. First, 5 thromboplastins were calibrated against an international reference using 60 plasmas of patients with liver failure and, in a second step, the variation of PT reported as seconds, the ratio of patient PT to normal PT, INR, and INR"LD" was assessed in 34 other patients. MELD scores were calculated with the INR values obtained with the 5 thromboplastins. Only INR"LD" eliminated variability in PT results observed with the different thromboplastins. The discrepancy between MELD scores were up to 4 and 7 points in 52% and 17% of the patients, respectively.

Conclusion

INR "LD" may provide a common international scale of PT reporting in hepatology. Its adoption would be an important step because of the significant impact on MELD score induced by interlaboratory variability in INR determination.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^112bqoov]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Standard coagulation monitoring comprises early and repeated determination of PT, platelet counts and Clauss fibrinogen level. The PT measures the activity of the extrinsic coagulation pathway (factors II, VII, and X), resulting in a prolonged PT value when any of these factors is low. There is frequently confusion in the literature over the terms PT and INR, because they are often used interchangeably, despite being based on different comparative values. Strictly speaking, PT is the ratio of the patient's PT compared with a PT performed using pooled plasma from healthy individuals. Conventionally, PT testing has been used for all patients except those treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The INR, on the other hand, represents a PT in which the activating tissue factor used in the assay is assigned a value such that the effect of the VKA is consistent across laboratories.

Because the definition of traumatic coagulopathy is equivalent to a prolongation of the PT, PT values on admission have been shown to correlate with the degree of shock and to be predictive of clinical outcome in the presence of traumatic haemorrhage. Peltan et al. for example, found that acute traumatic coagulopathy affected 50% of patients with traumatic bleeding, defined as a PT:INR ratio > 1.2 and 21% of subjects if traumatic coagulopathy was defined as an INR > 1.5. The latter was significantly associated with all-cause death, haemorrhagic shock-associated death, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and multiple organ failure. As a result, PT/INR is used to assess the severity of traumatic coagulopathy and the need for transfusion.

Recently, POC monitors (portable coagulometers) that assess the INR have improved in quality and ease of use. They are widely applied by professionals in anticoagulant clinics and at home by patients to monitor the effect of VKAs. Use may be more common in the emergency department to identify patients with significant coagulopathy compared with laboratory-based methods. It is, however, important to note that variation between these devices and a laboratory-based PT may be 15%. David et al. suggest that a near-patient INR value of 1.5 could be used to guide fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) administration. Goodman et al. demonstrated that POC INR testing was more rapid and cheaper than a modified thrombelastography [TEG®; rapid TEG® (r-TEG®)] and correlated not only with r-TEG® values, but also with blood product transfusion.

### REDucing unnecessary coagulation testing in the emergency department (REDUCED) [^1163qmUG]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) and aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) were tests developed in the early 20th century for specific and unique indications. Despite this, they are often ordered together routinely. The objective of this study was to determine if a multimodal intervention could reduce PT/INR and aPTT testing in the emergency department (ED). This was a prospective multi-pronged quality improvement study at St. Michael's Hospital. The initiative involved stakeholder engagement, uncoupling of PT/INR and aPTT testing, teaching, and most importantly a revision to the ED order panels. After changes to order panels, weekly rates of PT/INR and aPTT testing per 100 ED patients decreased (17.2 vs 38.4, rate ratio = 0.45 (95% CI 0.43–0.47), p < 0.001; 16.6 vs 37.8, rate ratio = 0.44 (95% CI 0.42–0.46), p < 0.001, respectively). Rate of creatinine testing per 100 ED patients, our internal control, increased during the same period (54.0 vs 49.7, rate ratio = 1.09 (95% CI 1.06–1.12); p < 0.0001) while the weekly rate per 100 ED patients receiving blood transfusions slightly decreased (0.5 vs 0.7, rate ratio = 0.66 (95% CI 0.49–0.87), p = 0.0034). We found that a simple process change to order panels was associated with meaningful reductions in coagulation testing without obvious adverse effects.

### The prothrombin time / international normalized ratio (PT / INR) line: derivation of local INR with commercial thromboplastins and coagulometers – two independent studies [^1157ExPb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The WHO scheme for prothrombin time (PT) standardization has been limited in application, because of its difficulties in implementation, particularly the need for mandatory manual PT testing and for local provision of thromboplastin international reference preparations (IRP).

Methods

The value of a new simpler procedure to derive international normalized ratio (INR), the PT/INR Line, based on only five European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA) calibrant plasmas certified by experienced centres has been assessed in two independent exercises using a range of commercial thromboplastins and coagulometers. INRs were compared with manual certified values with thromboplastin IRP from expert centres and in the second study also with INRs from local ISI calibrations.

Results

In the first study with the PT/INR Line, 8.7% deviation from certified INRs was reduced to 1.1% with human reagents, and from 7.0% to 2.6% with rabbit reagents. In the second study, deviation was reduced from 11.2% to 0.4% with human reagents by both local ISI calibration and the PT/INR Line. With rabbit reagents, 10.4% deviation was reduced to 1.1% with both procedures; 4.9% deviation was reduced to 0.5% with bovine/combined reagents with local ISI calibrations and to 2.9% with the PT/INR Line. Mean INR dispersion was reduced with all thromboplastins and automated systems using the PT/INR Line.

Conclusions

The procedure using the PT/INR Line provides reliable INR derivation without the need for WHO ISI calibration across the range of locally used commercial thromboplastins and automated PT systems included in two independent international studies.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115fvJS4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Laboratory measurement — clinically relevant bleeding or urgent procedures: In anticoagulated patients with clinically relevant bleeding or needing an urgent unplanned procedure, measurement of anticoagulant activity is a key step, and a prothrombin time (PT) and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be requested in all such patients; patients taking a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) may be evaluated with the PT/international normalized ratio (INR), and the INR may be used to guide perioperative or bleeding management; for direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the minimum level that may contribute to bleeding risk is unknown, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommends consideration of anticoagulant reversal for serious bleeding with a DOAC level > 50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk with a DOAC level > 30 ng/mL.

### Coagulometer international sensitivity index (ISI) derivation, a rapid method using the prothrombin time / international normalized ratio (PT / INR) line: a multicenter study [^114e5Fkj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The original WHO procedure for prothrombin time (PT) standardization has been almost entirely abandoned because of the universal use of PT coagulometers. These often give different international normalized ratio (INR) results from the manual method, between individual makes of instruments and with instruments from the same manufacture.

Method

A simple procedure is required to derive local INR with coagulometers. The PT/INR Line method has recently been developed using five European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA) certified plasmas to derive local INR. This procedure has been modified to derive a coagulometer PT/INR Line providing International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and mean normal PT (MNPT) for coagulometers and give local INR. Results have been compared with conventional ISI calibrations at the same laboratories.

Results

With human thromboplastins, mean ISI by local calibration was 0.93 (range: 0.77–1.16). With the PT/INR Line, mean coagulometer ISI was higher, for example 0.99 (0.84–1.23) but using the PT/INR Line derived MNPT there was no difference in local INR. Between-centre INR variation of a certified validation plasma was reduced with human and bovine reagents after correction with local ISI calibrations and the PT/INR Line.

Conclusion

The PT/INR Line-ISI with its derived MNPT is shown to provide reliable local INR with the 13 different reagent/coagulometer combinations at the 28 centres in this international study.

### Variations of prothrombin time and international normalized ratio in patients treated with warfarin [^1116RqqG]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time is a standard screening test to monitor patients treated with oral anticoagulants. We hypothesize that INR measurements will not vary a lot within a given day in a given patient. The present study was thus conducted to compare the change of the international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time (PT) within 1 day in patients treated with warfarin. Thirty such patients and nineteen healthy controls were enrolled into this study. PT was performed in four time points of a day in all subjects, two in the morning and two in the afternoon. The four INR values obtained were compared with each other to find little change in the series of time either in patients or in healthy controls. Neither were they affected by renal function, liver function, sex, age, hemoglobin, white cell count, platelet, treatment duration of warfarin, or alcoholic drinking. INR could be measured in any time of a day to have values equally valuable in clinical use.

### A national study of plasma use in critical care: clinical indications, dose and effect on prothrombin time [^111hV4QR]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our pragmatic study. Around one-half of the participating ICUs reported coagulation results as PT and one-half reported them as INRs. The definition of coagulopathy was based on PT prolongation and a threshold INR value > 1.5. This cutoff level is commonly used by clinicians and described in the literature, and the use of the INR allowed the data to be compared and standardised across the ICUs, which would not be possible for the PT, given that laboratories use different thromboplastins with different laboratory-specific mean normal PT and ISI. However, the PT was developed to assess coagulation factor deficiencies, and the INR was developed to standardise assessment of the response to vitamin K antagonists. For our primary analysis, we did not relate FFP use to APTT, which could also trigger correction of coagulation, especially in relation to bleeding. To explore the potential importance of APTT values, we examined the 56 patients who received 64 FFP treatments but never had documented PT prolongation during their ICU stay, and then extracted the APTT value prior to FFP transfusion. The results did not suggest that APTT prolongation was likely to explain the widespread use of FFP when the INR was normal or mildly prolonged, although our study was not designed to answer this question.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — monitoring anticoagulant intensity by the international normalized ratio (INR) relies on PT-based calibration and has early-therapy caveats: The PT test is the most common test used to monitor VKA therapy, and during the first few days of warfarin therapy the PT reflects mainly a reduction of factor VII, the half-life of which is approximately 6 h. PT monitoring of VKA treatment is not standardized when expressed in seconds, or as a simple ratio or percentage, so a calibration model adopted in 1982 converts the local PT ratio into an INR, calculated as follows: INR = [patient PT/mean normal PT]ᴵˢᴵ or log INR = ISI × (log observed PT ratio). For calibration, patients' samples should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5 to 4.5 INR range, and outliers with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual SDs from the line of relationship should be rejected. Because the half-life of prothrombin is about 60 to 72 h, at least 5 days of overlap is necessary, and the INR is based on ISI values derived from the plasma of patients who had received stable anticoagulant doses for at least 6 weeks; as a result, the INR has not been validated and should be viewed with some skepticism early in the course of warfarin therapy, particularly when results are obtained from different laboratories.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^1136kfi4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

INR tests give misleading results with NOACs

Dabigatran inhibits coagulation by directly and specifically binding thrombin (factor IIa); rivaroxaban and apixaban directly and specifically bind FXa. These modes of action differ from that of warfarin and make the results of PT/INR tests unreliable in patients treated with the newer agents. The INR is relatively insensitive to dabigatran-induced anticoagulation, yielding normal or near-normal results at therapeutic dabigatran plasma concentrations and only slight increases at higher drug levels. INR testing with point-of-care devices in dabigatran-treated patients is similarly unreliable. The FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have been reported to give variable results with PT tests, which are relatively insensitive to FXa inhibitor-induced changes in coagulation. Therefore, for a patient treated with dabigatran, the PT will not give valid information and could give the erroneous impression that the patient's coagulation status is normal or near-normal.

### Liver biopsy [^1148h7vV]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy — bleeding risk relative to international normalized ratio (INR) and test applicability: A United Kingdom survey of 1500 patients found clinically important bleeding was more common when INR was greater than 1.5 than when it was between 1.3 and 1.5, yet a systematic review of 25 studies, including three liver biopsy studies, failed to show a clear relationship between conventional coagulation tests and bleeding risk. The page notes the commonly used PT-INR is derived from coumadin-treated reference ranges and thus lacks applicability to INR in liver disease, and states it is not clear whether prolongation of the INR in chronic liver disease represents a bleeding diathesis; additionally, available data do not appear to support these assumptions, particularly in patients with mild coagulopathy defined as an INR of less than 2.0.

International normalized ratio (INR) measurement — potential problems causing erroneous INRs are enumerated and include: incorrect PTR from erroneous PT determination due to Pretest variables (sampling and blood collection problems); incorrect ISI of local thromboplastin reagent/test system from lack of reliability of the ISI result provided by the manufacturer; drift of ISI since original calibration; instrument (coagulometer) effects on INR at local site; lupus anticoagulant effects on some thromboplastin reagents; lack of reliability of the INR system when used at the onset of warfarin therapy and for screening for a coagulopathy in patients with liver disease; and relative lack of reliability of INR > 4.5 as these values excluded from ISI calibrations.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113B9zZj]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

International normalized ratio (INR) monitoring and laboratory handling — vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are better tracked with INR than the unconverted prothrombin time (PT) ratio, and calibration/sample practices materially affect accuracy. The INR is more reliable than the unconverted PT ratio and its use is thus recommended during both the initiation and maintenance of VKAs. The College of American Pathologists has recommended that laboratories should use thromboplastin reagents that are at least moderately responsive (ie, ISI < 1.7) and reagent/instrument combinations with established and validated ISI; manufacturer-provided ISI values may not be correct locally, so local calibrations using plasma samples with certified PT values should be used to determine the instrument-specific ISI, the mean normal plasma PT is not interchangeable with a laboratory control PT, and the mean normal PT should be determined for each new batch of thromboplastin with the same instrument. Higher citrate concentrations (eg, 3.8%) lead to higher INR values and underfilling tubes spuriously prolongs PT, whereas using collection tubes containing 3.2% citrate and adequately filling tubes can reduce this problem.

### During warfarin induction, the fiix-prothrombin time reflects the anticoagulation level better than the standard prothrombin time [^1165Q5xC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Fiix-prothrombin time (PT) monitoring of warfarin measuring factor (F) II and X, is effective. Plasma obtained during warfarin induction and stable phase in Fiix-trial was assayed. Fiix-PT stabilized anticoagulation earlier than monitoring with traditional PT-INR. FVII had little effect on thrombin generation that was mainly determined by FII and FX.

Summary

Background The prothrombin time (PT) is equally prolonged by reduction of each of the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) factors (F) II, VII and X. The Fiix-PT is only affected by FII and FX, the main contributors to thrombin generation (TG). Objective To test the hypothesis that variability in warfarin anticoagulation is reduced early during monitoring with the normalized PT-ratio calculated from Fiix-PT (Fiix-International Normalized Ratio [INR]) compared with traditional PT-INR monitoring. Also, that because of its insensitivity to FVII, Fiix-PT more accurately reflects TG when Fiix-INR and PT-INR are discrepant. Methods Samples from Fiix-trial participants monitored with either Fiix-PT or PT were used. VKD coagulation factors and TG were measured in samples from 40 patients during stable anticoagulation and in serial samples obtained from 26 patients during warfarin induction. TG was assessed in relation to selective reduction in single VKD factors. Results During Fiix-warfarin induction full anticoagulation measured as FII or FX activity was achieved at a similar rate to that with PT-warfarin but subsequently stabilized better. Fiix-INR but not PT-INR mirrored total TG during initiation. During induction, FII (R² = 0.66) and FX (R² = 0.52) correlated better with TG and with a steeper slope than did FIX (R² = 0.37) and in particular FVII (R² = 0.21). In vitro, FII and FX were the main determinants of TG at concentrations observed during VKA anticoagulation, whereas FVII and FIX had little influence. Conclusions Fiix-PT monitoring reduces anticoagulation variability, suggesting that monitoring FVII has a limited role during VKA management. TG is better reflected by Fiix-PT.

Rivaroxaban — monitoring anticoagulant intensity — The predictable pharmacologic profile of rivaroxaban allows administration at fixed doses without the need for routine laboratory monitoring or dose adjustments, though there may be rare situations (overdose, unexpected bleeding, compliance assessment, drug interactions, or drug accumulation in renal or hepatic impairment) when a quantitative clotting assay might be valuable; however, there are currently no validated laboratory assays that can be recommended to monitor rivaroxaban or any recommendations for dose adjustments based on observed test results. Thromboplastins used for prothrombin time (PT) assays have differing sensitivities to factor Xa inhibitors, the INR does not adequately correct for these differences, and PT ratios measured after adding rivaroxaban 1 µg/mL to plasma varied from 2.25 to 7.32 with different thromboplastins; in assay evaluations, there was a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the effect on the aPTT was weaker than on the PT, and rivaroxaban also prolonged thromboelastograph parameters. Neither the PT (expressed either in seconds or as a ratio) nor the aPTT should be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban.

### Anticoagulation monitoring part 1: warfarin and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors [^1173T26C]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the availability, mechanisms, limitations, and clinical application of point-of-care (POC) devices used in the management of warfarin and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors.

Data Sources

Scientific articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-August 2004), manufacturer Web sites, additional references listed in articles and Web sites, and abstracts from scientific meetings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature from clinical trials was reviewed to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and clinical application of POC monitoring devices.

Data Synthesis

The prothrombin time expressed as the international normalized ratio (PT-INR) is a well-established test for monitoring warfarin anticoagulation. Multiple devices are available for POC testing. Because there is no universally accepted standard, the performance of each device is typically tested against a standard test performed in a reference laboratory. Performance of currently available devices, as measured by correlations to a standard reference laboratory PT-INR, may be considered very good and acceptable for use in patient care. Utilization of patient self-testing and patient self-monitoring of warfarin anticoagulation using POC devices is increasing. Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors are typically monitored using a standard laboratory activated partial thromboplastin time. Some research has shown that POC monitoring of direct thrombin inhibitors using the ecarin clotting time is helpful for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, although that test is not readily available.

Conclusions

POC testing for anticoagulation therapy has been available for > 20 years. Multiple POC devices are available to monitor warfarin. There is some variability in results between devices and between reagents used in the same device. Despite these limitations, POC monitoring of warfarin via the PT-INR is an integral part of clinical practice. Additional research evaluating POC monitoring of direct thrombin inhibitors is necessary.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^1154tjq4]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) Surgical Management of Stones — preoperative coagulation studies: The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) addresses periprocedural assessment for percutaneous nephrostomy, categorizing it as a procedure with "significant bleeding risk, difficult to direct or control", and based on this designation advises routinely obtaining pre-procedural international normalized ratio (INR) to assess standardized prothrombin time (PT) in all patients before nephrostomy tube placement, although there was no consensus on obtaining pre-procedural partial thromboplastin time (PTT). In contradistinction, the ASA discourages routine preoperative testing in unselected patients and states coagulation studies should be selectively obtained based upon clinical characteristics, including documented or suspected bleeding disorders, hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction; those on anticoagulant medications may require coagulation studies preoperatively. The Panel, concurrent with the ASA, concludes that in the absence of clinical indications, coagulation studies should not be routinely obtained prior to surgical management of urinary stone disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^113tepiD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Key concepts: portal hypertension and hemostasis considerations — Degree of portal hypertension is one of the most important surgical risk factors, and cirrhosis decompensation and clinical manifestations of clinically significant portal hypertension are strongly associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. Cirrhosis affects both prothrombotic and antithrombotic pathways, and the net effect on hemostasis is not accurately reflected by traditional laboratory tests such as prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet count. Very low platelet counts (e.g., ≤ 50–75/μL) are independently associated with procedural bleeding and adverse postoperative outcomes, yet PT/INR is not independently associated with procedural bleeding in cirrhosis.

We applied a new statistical method to improve comparisons between systems measuring prothrombin time (PT) by splitting disagreement into systematic errors, which can be eliminated, and random errors, which can not. We found that the disagreement between International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements based on plasma and whole blood was significantly patient-dependent.

Plasma products (fresh frozen plasma [FFP], PF24, or thawed plasma) — indications, non-indications, and dosing: FFP is indicated for correction of microvascular bleeding (i.e., coagulopathy) in the presence of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than 2.0 in the absence of heparin; for correction of excessive microvascular bleeding secondary to coagulation factor deficiency in patients transfused with more than one blood volume (approximately 70 ml/kg) and when prothrombin time (PT) or INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) cannot be obtained in a timely fashion; for urgent reversal of warfarin therapy when PCCs are not available; and for correction of known coagulation factor deficiencies for which specific concentrates are unavailable. FFP is not indicated if PT or INR and aPTT are normal or solely for augmentation of plasma volume or albumin concentration. Administer FFP in doses calculated to achieve a minimum of 30% of plasma factor concentration, noting that four to five platelet concentrates, 1 unit single-donor apheresis platelets, or 1 unit fresh whole blood provide a quantity of coagulation factors similar to that contained in one unit FFP.

### A national study of plasma use in critical care: clinical indications, dose and effect on prothrombin time [^112QZci7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conversely, the large number of FFP transfusions administered to nonbleeding patients without INR prolongation or with minor derangements suggests the possibility of widespread and inconsistent use of FFP without strong clinical rationale. Recent systematic reviews indicate the poor quality of existing evidence, including the poor predictive value of standard coagulation tests, and no clear benefit of prophylactic use or to reduce bleeding related to planned procedures. Indeed, available data suggest that many patients with isolated minor abnormalities in PT or INR have adequate individual coagulation factor levels, which would be consistent with our data. Furthermore, the FFP volumes administered in these nonbleeding situations were 9 ml/kg or less in more than 50% of cases, and these doses are highly unlikely to result in consistent increases (if any) in coagulation factor levels if deficiencies do exist. Our data show that critical care clinicians in the UK continue to use FFP widely in this prophylactic situation, with evidence of insignificant changes in the INR value.

Stronger evidence is needed to guide clinicians. Specifically, evidence suggesting that correction of INR prolongation is not required in the prophylactic clinical situation could significantly alter current practice and potentially reduce demand for FFP. Continuing reports of an association between FFP administration and adverse patient outcomes in patients, including the critically ill, further emphasise the requirement to improve the evidence base, especially for transfusion of FFP to nonbleeding patients.

Our population estimates found that 0.63 FFP units/ICU admission were utilised in UK general critical care units, which equates to approximately 63,000 units/year, based on the 100,000 patients admitted to general ICUs in the UK each year. This comprises around 21% of the total FFP used in the UK and, of note, excludes cardiac ICUs, which were not included in our study. On the basis of our estimates of the proportion used in nonbleeding patients with normal or mildly deranged INRs (< 2.5), who received 40% of FFP treatments, and our observed median use for this indication of 2 FFP units/transfusion episode, we estimate that about 40,000 units are transfused each year to patients in whom the evidence base for benefit is weak. These estimates illustrate the potential impact of an improved evidence base, particularly if this evidence supports more restrictive use. The potential cost implications of introducing newer products, such as factor complex concentrates or pathogen-inactivated plasma, are also unclear in the absence of evidence of benefit for the standard product.

### The international normalized ratio calibrated for cirrhosis (INR (liver)) normalizes prothrombin time results for model for end-stage liver disease calculation [^113exntH]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The model for end-stage-liver-disease (MELD) is a mathematical score used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation and includes results for creatinine, bilirubin, and prothrombin time (PT) expressed as international normalized ratio (INR). The rationale of using the MELD rests on the assumption that the score would be the same across the country if the methods used to measure the variables yield the same numerical results regardless of the testing laboratory. Evidence was provided that specific methodologies may influence the MELD, and the PT-INR was identified as the most important. This study was designed to provide information on the between-thromboplastin variability and to explore alternatives to obviate such variability. Fifty-seven patients with cirrhosis were selected, and their PTs were measured with 7 thromboplastins. The thromboplastins were previously calibrated by testing plasmas from patients on vitamin K antagonists and healthy subjects to assign the international sensitivity index (ISI(vka)) needed to convert PT into INR. Each of the thromboplastins was also assigned an ISI(liver) by substituting in the calibration the plasmas from vitamin K antagonist patients with plasmas from patients with cirrhosis. INR and MELD values for individual patients were calculated by using the ISI(vka) or the ISI(liver). The mean INR(vka) obtained with the 7 thromboplastins were significantly different (P < 0.001). Conversely, the mean INR(liver) were not. Similarly, the mean MELD(vka) were significantly different (P < 0.001), but those differences were abrogated for the MELD(liver).

Conclusion

The alternative thromboplastin calibration using plasmas from patients with cirrhosis instead of from vitamin K antagonist patients is feasible and may resolve the variability of the MELD to prioritize patients for transplantation.

### Continued harmonization of the international normalized ratio across a large laboratory network: evidence of sustained low interlaboratory variation and bias after a change in instrumentation [^1164sDc4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Our objective was to maintain low interlaboratory variation and bias in international normalized ratio (INR) results following a network change in instrumentation and reagents, using a process of ongoing standardization and harmonization.

Methods

Network-wide standardization to new common instrument and reagent platforms followed by network-wide application of a simple novel process of verification of international sensitive index and mean normal prothrombin time values for each new lot of prothrombin time (PT) reagent that does not require use of World Health Organization reference thromboplastin or INR calibration/certified plasma.

Results

The network transitioned from mechanical hemostasis detection instruments with associated PT reagent (Diagnostica Stago; NeoPTimal) to optical detection (ACL TOPs) with associated PT reagent (Werfen; RecombiPlasTin 2G). Comparing 3 years of data for each situation, the network (n = 27 laboratories) maintained low INR variability and bias relative to general mechanical and optical groups and other laboratories.

Conclusions

Harmonized support for patient management of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin was continuously maintained in our geography, with potentially positive implications for other coagulation laboratories and geographies. For the United States in particular, paucity of US Food and Drug Administration-cleared INR certified plasmas potentially compromises INR test accuracy; our novel approach may provide workable alternatives for other laboratories/networks.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^116QaEcJ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Preoperative coagulation testing before endoscopy — prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) — in patients without evidence of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy neither predicts nor correlates with intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage. In the absence of clinical suspicion, abnormal PT results are found in less than 1% of patients, while abnormal PTT results are encountered in approximately 6.5% of patients, with reports as high as 16.3%. The PTT is not sensitive for hemophilia and has a false-positive rate of approximately 2.3%, and the calculated incidence of hemophilia in males without a family history of the disease or a history of major trauma or surgery is only 0.0025%, therefore a screening PTT for hemophilia is not recommended in the absence of clinical suspicion. An abnormal PTT result does not reliably predict perioperative hemorrhage, and a study of 1000 patients found that all patients with a prolonged PTT had clinical risk factors for bleeding. In children undergoing endoscopic procedures, abnormal PT and/or PTT test results occurred in 16.8% of patients, but these results did not predict bleeding episodes. Routine PT and PTT measurements are not clinically useful unless the patient has a history of abnormal bleeding or known bleeding disorder or malnutrition; is receiving prolonged therapy with antibiotics associated with clotting factor deficiencies; is receiving anticoagulant therapy; or has prolonged biliary obstruction, and in summary, in the absence of clinical suspicion, routine preoperative screening for coagulopathy with PT, INR, PTT, platelet count, or bleeding time, either alone or in combination, is not recommended.

### International normalized ratio is significantly elevated with rivaroxaban and apixaban drug therapies: a retrospective study [^11372tr8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban or apixaban may prolong prothrombin time (PT) and elevate international normalized ratio (INR). However, these tests are not reliable for assessing the anticoagulation effects of these agents. PT assay sensitivity is relatively weak at therapeutic drug concentrations and is subjected to significant variations depending on the reagent used. Conversion of PT to INR may even increase the variability. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study aiming to assess the prevalence and extent of INR elevation in hospitalized patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban as part of their home medications and to find out whether other existing factors could elevate INR apart from the drug entity itself.

Methods

The data collected from 218 hospitalized patients׳ charts included PT and INR taken on admission, patients׳ characteristics, laboratory results, other medications regularly used, and coexisting clinical conditions.

Findings

No statistically significant association between INR elevation and the parameters examined was found in our study. INR was significantly elevated in both drug groups (P < 0.001), with 84.2% of rivaroxaban patients and 78.3% of apixaban patients presenting with INR levels above the higher limit of the normal range. Furthermore, INR was significantly higher in the rivaroxaban group than in the apixaban group (P < 0.001).

Implications

Both of the reviewed drugs significantly elevated INR. Moreover, rivaroxaban elevates INR significantly more than apixaban, and there are apparently no other factors affecting INR but the drugs themselves. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm and clarify the clinical significance of these results.

### Ignoring instead of chasing after coagulation factor VII during warfarin management: an interrupted time series study [^111CPQqi]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

During warfarin management, variability in prothrombin time-based international normalized ratio (PT-INR) is caused, in part, by clinically inconsequential fluctuations in factor VII (FVII). The new factor II and X (Fiix)-prothrombin time (Fiix-PT) and Fiix-normalized ratio (Fiix-NR), unlike PT-INR, are only affected by reduced FII and FX. We assessed the incidence of thromboembolism (TE) and major bleeding (MB) in all 2667 patients on maintenance-phase warfarin managed at our anticoagulation management service during 30 months; 12 months prior to and 18 months after replacing PT-INR monitoring with Fiix-NR monitoring. Months 13 to 18 were predefined as transitional months. Using 2-segmented regression, a breakpoint in the monthly incidence of TE became evident 6 months after test replacement, that was followed by a 56% reduction in incidence (from 2.82% to 1.23% per patient-year; p = 0.019). Three-segmented regression did not find any significant trend in TE incidence (slope, +0.03) prior to test replacement; however, during months 13 to 18 and 19 to 30, the incidence of TE decreased gradually (slope, -0.12; R² = 0.20; p = 0.007). The incidence of MB (2.79% per patient-year) did not differ. Incidence comparison during the 12-month Fiix and PT periods confirmed a statistically significant reduction (55–62%) in TE. Fiix monitoring reduced testing, dose adjustments, and normalized ratio variability and prolonged testing intervals and time in range. We conclude that ignoring FVII during Fiix-NR monitoring in real-world practice stabilizes the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and associates with a major reduction in TEs without increasing bleeding.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to summarize systematically evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

Results

We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays, showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

Conclusions

An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT or APTT is recommended over PT/INR for assessment of dabigatran, and PT/INR is recommended over APTT for detection of factor Xa inhibitors. Time since last dose, the presence or absence of drug interactions, and renal and hepatic function should impact clinical estimates of anticoagulant effect in a patient for whom laboratory test results are not available.

### Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant activity: challenges in measurement and reversal [^113nC5E1]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of anticoagulation levels

Unlike VKAs, NOACs do not require routine coagulation monitoring, in part due to predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and fewer drug–drug and drug–food interactions. Prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) are routinely used to measure VKA anticoagulation levels but INR is not considered an accurate measure of anticoagulation in patients on NOACs. Unlike VKAs, PT/INR correction for NOACs does not eliminate the variability arising from use of different thromboplastins; this results in difficulty in standardizing clotting assays for clinical testing.

In the event of emergent bleeding, determination of a patient's level of anticoagulation and the ability to measure the effectiveness of a reversal agent are important. In addition to determining the management of bleeding, assessing the presence or absence of anticoagulation can also eliminate unnecessary and costly actions in attempting NOAC reversal. Thus, understanding the impact of NOACs on common laboratory coagulation tests and the relationship of this impact on clinical coagulation status is critical. To date, no single routine laboratory test has been identified to accurately measure the clinical anticoagulation state of patients on NOACs, although a number of assays are responsive to NOACs (Table 1).

Table 1
Laboratory assays responsive to NOACs

aPTT activated partial thromboplastin time, FXa direct factor Xa, PT prothrombin time, TT thrombin time

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) can provide an approximation of the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran and is a reasonable screening test for the presence of the direct thrombin inhibitor; however, variability in results should be expected and no guidance is provided regarding the clinical relevance of a particular level of recovery. More sensitive assays for monitoring dabigatran include thrombin time (TT), diluted thrombin time, and ecarin clotting time (ECT) for determining specific levels of anticoagulation.

At therapeutic doses, PT and aPTT are prolonged by rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. However, because these changes are quite small and variable and dependent on the thromboplastin employed, they are not recommended for routine monitoring of anticoagulant effects. PT and aPTT are less sensitive to apixaban than to rivaroxaban and dabigatran in head-to-head comparison in platelet-poor plasma.

### Paving the way for establishing a reference measurement system for standardization of plasma prothrombin time: harmonizing the manual tilt tube method [^114SuY6s]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

For monitoring of oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA), the prothrombin time (PT) is the primary measurement. The PT test requires reagents called thromboplastins. Various types of thromboplastin are prepared commercially and, to be able to interpret the results of the PT test, it is essential that each reagent is correctly calibrated. A procedure for the calibration of thromboplastins has been described in the report of the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. 1 With this procedure, the definition of a calibration parameter called International Sensitivity Index (ISI) became feasible. To achieve standardization of the PT, it is possible to express PT results on a common scale (ie, the international normalized ratio [INR]) if the ISI and the mean normal PT (MNPT) of the thromboplastin is known.

In general, the calibration of a given thromboplastin is more precise if performed against an international reference preparation of similar composition and from the same species. A system of coexisting international reference preparations has been established in which each of these materials is traceable to the first primary international reference preparation of thromboplastin, human, combined (coded 67/40). Two international reference preparations for thromboplastin are currently available from the WHO Laboratory for Biological Standards: the Fifth International Standard for thromboplastin, rabbit, plain (coded RBT/16), and the Fifth International Standard for thromboplastin, recombinant, human, plain (coded rTF/16). 2

The availability of international reference preparations for thromboplastin alone is not sufficient for standardization of the PT. To define a reference measurement system (RMS) not only a reference thromboplastin is required, but also a reference measurement procedure (RMP).

### Long-term stability of frozen pooled plasmas stored at-70 ° C,-40 ° C, and-20 ° C for prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) assessment [^111kWwWj]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Frozen pooled plasmas may be used for quality assessment and local calibration of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurement systems. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the long-term stability of frozen pooled plasmas stored for at least three years.

Methods

Six pooled plamas with different INR levels were stored at -70°C, -40°C, and -20°C for various time periods up to 1453days. PT of stored samples were measured with two thromboplastin reagents on a single automated coagulation instrument. INR was calculated from PT and plotted against plasma storage time. Linear regression lines of INR on storage time were used to estimate the percentage increase of INR.

Results

INR of plasma stored at -40°C or -20°C increased significantly with time. INR of plasma stored at -70°C did not change significantly in 11 out of 12 cases. The INR change of pooled plasmas stored at -70°C for 3years varied between 0.07% and 2.03%.

Conclusion

Long-term storage of plasmas at -40°C or -20°C should be avoided. Pooled plasmas stored at -70°C can be used for quality assessment and local calibration for at least 3years.

### Bleeding risk in warfarinized patients with a therapeutic international normalized ratio: the effect of low factor IX levels [^114jDFei]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bleeding is the main complication of warfarin therapy, even patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) in the target range can suffer bleeding, suggesting that INR does not perfectly reflect the therapeutic effect of warfarin. We hypothesized the INR might underestimate the level of anticoagulation in a subject with a lower factor (F) IX level than average.

Methods and Results

We modeled warfarin anticoagulation in our in vitro thrombin generation (TG) model by adjusting the levels of vitamin K-dependent factors to those of patients with an INR of 2–3. Variation in FIX had a marked effect on TG but had no effect on the prothrombin time (PT)-INR. A prospective observational, cross-sectional clinical study including 341 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency department with an INR between 2 and 3, showed a statistically lower FIX activity in bleeders (P = 0.004) compared with others. No correlation was found between TG capacity and PT-INR results (P = 0.36). However, in patients, presenting with a warfarin-related hemorrhage, TG was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than others. A correlation on the boundary of significance was observed between TG capacity and FIX levels (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

These data demonstrates that patients who bleed when their PT-INR is in the target range 2–3 might have defective TG related to a lower level of FIX than expected.

WARNING: CAPECITABINE-WARFARIN INTERACTION

Capecitabine Warfarin Interaction: Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored frequently in order to adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly. A clinically important capecitabine-Warfarin drug interaction was demonstrated in a clinical pharmacology trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. Post marketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time capecitabine was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. Age greater than 60 and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy.

### The acute management of haemorrhage, surgery and overdose in patients receiving dabigatran [^117Gd53D]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Coagulation assays: measuring the effect of dabigatran

Prothrombin time /international normalised ratio

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, reduce the levels of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. The prothrombin time (PT) is particularly sensitive to a reduction in factor VII, and, as a result, treatment with vitamin K antagonists results in prolongation of the PT. This is usually expressed as a standardised ratio (the international normalised ratio (INR)), which is used to monitor the therapeutic anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

The PT/INR is insensitive to dabigatran at therapeutic levels. It may be prolonged by supratherapeutic levels of dabigatran, but the results will vary widely between laboratories, because of variation in the sensitivity of different reagents to the effect of dabigatran. Neither a laboratory-based nor point-of-care PT/INR can be used to assess the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.

Activated partial thromboplastin time

The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) provides a measure of the intrinsic (factors VIII, IX and XI) and common (factors II, V, X and fibrinogen) coagulation pathway. The APTT can be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin. The APTT displays a curvilinear dose response to increasing plasma concentrations of dabigatranand may be used to demonstrate that a patient is anticoagulated with dabigatran — for example, if a patient is bleeding or needs surgery. However, it does not provide a quantitative measurement and should not be used for routine monitoring.

In the stroke prevention trial, the APTT ratio was 1.4–2.3 in patients receiving 150 mg twice a day, and 1.3–2.1 in those receiving 110 mg twice a day, with a peak effect seen 2 h after administration. Prolongation of the APTT is maintained for at least 8–12 h, with a measurable effect still seen in some patients after 24 h. If the APTT is prolonged by 2–3-fold at trough (when the next dose is due), there is a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, knowledge of the time of last dose is important for interpretation of the APTT, particularly if an invasive procedure is planned.

### Use of EDTA samples for prothrombin time measurement in patients receiving oral anticoagulants [^115k52yq]. Haematologica (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Oral anticoagulant therapy is commonly called for in health care. Hitherto sampling for prothrombin time (PT) has been measured on blood collected into a coagulation tube and diluted in citrate solution. Blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA are used for hematologic tests and the same sample could also be available for PT.

Design and Methods

We studied 107 patients on oral anticoagulant therapy. Samples were taken by from both coagulation tubes (citrate) and EDTA tubes. The PT from both samples was measured with an ACL 7000 analyzer and reported in seconds and as an international normalized ratio (INR). The regression equation between citrate and EDTA samples was calculated in both units. We studied the clinical significance of INR results from both sample types and compared the effect of different combined thromboplastin reagents on the correlation equation between citrate and EDTA samples.

Results

The regression equation for PT by Owren's PT reagent from citrate (y) and EDTA (x) plasma was y = 1.11 x -0.24 INR, R² = 0.99. We observed no clinically significant difference between INR results from citrate and EDTA samples using the regression equation for INR calculation from EDTA samples. ISI depends on sample type (dilution, anticoagulant) and the difference is 0.117, 10%. We calculated ISI for EDTA samples and no clinically significant difference was seen between citrate and EDTA INR results.

Interpretation and Conclusions

A good correlation was observed between INR results with citrate and EDTA samples from patients receiving oral anticoagulants using Owren's PT reagent with the same citrate calibration. Using the regression equation (INR or sec) for analysis of INR results from EDTA samples is clinically acceptable and offers the possibility of using EDTA samples for PT measurement with citrate calibrators. Reagent international sensitivity index (ISI) values for citrate and EDTA samples differ from each other. ISI determination for EDTA samples requires mathematical calculation of EDTA ISI as in the present study or EDTA-based ISI calibrators. The regression equation for INR from citrate and EDTA samples depended on the reagent used, not only on sample dilution or anticoagulant.

### Paving the way for establishing a reference measurement system for standardization of plasma prothrombin time: harmonizing the manual tilt tube method [^114USMrJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

International normalized ratio (INR) is traceable to World Health Organization (WHO) International Standards for thromboplastins. International Standards must be used with a manual tilt tube technique (MTT) for prothrombin time (PT) determination. An important part of the total variability of INR is due to poor harmonization of MTT across WHO reference laboratories.

Objectives

To determine the origins of PT differences between operators performing MTT and to develop a harmonized MTT.

Methods

Two workshops were held where WHO reference laboratory operators could compare their PTs using MTT and the same equipment. A harmonized MTT was used by seven operators in the second workshop.

Results

Differences have been observed in tilting frequency and in the height of pipetting plasma in the test tube. At the beginning of the first workshop, the tilting cycle time varied between 1.1 and 2.7 seconds. The mean PT of normal plasma obtained by pipetting plasma at the top of the tube was 14.3 seconds but was 12.9 seconds when plasma was pipetted at the bottom of the tube. When using the harmonized MTT for WHO International Standard rTF/16, the differences between operators were not greater than 1.1 seconds in normal plasma, and not greater than 1.3 seconds in patient plasma with average INR of 3.0. INR between‐operator coefficient of variation was 2.3%.

Conclusion

Application of a harmonized MTT in three reference laboratories resulted in substantial reduction of between‐operator variation of PT and INR. The harmonized MTT is proposed as Candidate Reference Measurement Procedure.

On the other hand, rivaroxaban prolongs PT in a dose-dependent manner, but this quantitative effect varies based on different thromboplastins because of their differing sensitivities to rivaroxaban. As international normalized ratio (INR) and the international sensitivity index (ISI) are based on VKA sensitivity. PT should not be interpreted as INR in patients treated with DOACs. PT can be a helpful tool determining the presence of DOACs in the trauma setting. Rivaroxaban also prolongs the aPTT, but this assay is less sensitive than the PT.

Despite lack of publications on apixaban and endoxaban, the qualitative CCA demonstrated that most PT and aPTT reagents show only mild or modest sensitivity for the drug. Depending on the reagent used, PT may remain normal at therapeutic concentrations of apixaban. CCAs are not recommended for estimating the relative anticoagulation intensity or plasma concentration of apixaban and endoxaban after therapeutic doses. In general, direct thrombin inhibitors (Dabigatran) tend to affect the aPTT more than the PT. In contrast, direct FXa inhibitors (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Endoxaban) impacts the PT more than the aPTT, nevertheless, a normal aPTT and/or PT cannot rule out the DOAC effect.

An analysis of a prospective observational study across 16 trauma centers showed that admission INR values were mildly elevated among patients on dabigatran and rivaroxaban compared with apixaban, patients on dabigatran presented with slightly higher than normal aPTT values whereas those on rivaroxaban and apixaban did not.

Ali et al. in a Trauma Level 1 Center, evaluated a cohort of 54 patients to determine the impact of pre-injury anticoagulation on CCA and TEG variables. CCA, identified a greater proportion of coagulopathy for patients on pre-injury anticoagulation therapy. This result demonstrated prolongation of the INR or aPTT, in 67% of the patients in anticoagulation therapy. aPTT values for patients exceeded the threshold for coagulopathy in 100% of patients on dabigatran, PT-INR in 85% of VKAs patients, and 63% of patients on anti-Xa inhibitors.

Oral anticoagulants

Warfarin

The coumarin-derived racemic mixture, warfarin, at peak usage was estimated to be taken by at least 1% of the whole UK population, and by 8% of those aged over 80 years. However, warfarin usage has decreased in many European countries and in the US, with a concomitant increase in the use of DOACs. Nevertheless, warfarin is still widely used especially in some of the lower-middle income countries, where affordability is a major issue.

Warfarin inhibits hepatic vitamin K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1). VKORC1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the warfarin sensitive vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylation system, and inhibition of VKORC1 reduces the production of functional clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, proteins C, S and Z, and leads to anticoagulation (Fig. 2). Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and large inter-individual variability with up to 20-fold difference in stable dose requirements between individuals. Therefore, warfarin treatment is closely monitored via the international normalised ratio (INR); for most indications, the recommended therapeutic INR range is 2.0–3.0. An overview of warfarin pharmacokinetics is provided in Table 2.

Patients with AF on warfarin are unsettlingly outside the therapeutic INR range 30–50% of the time. Importantly, bleeding is the most common warfarin ADR occurring in up to 41% of treated patients, with major bleeding frequencies as high as 10–16%. The risk of adverse events is highest during the initial dose-titration period within the first few weeks to months of warfarin therapy, and so strategies to individualise the initial warfarin doses have been sought.

### Coagulation factor viia recombinant human (sevenfact) [^115LKSPm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For intravenous use after reconstitution only.

2.1 Dose

Dose and duration of treatment depend on the location and severity of the bleeding, need for urgent hemostasis, frequency of administration, and known patient responsiveness to FVIIa-containing bypassing agents during prior bleeding events. Treatment with SEVENFACT should be initiated as soon as a bleeding event occurs.
The dose, frequency, and duration of SEVENFACT therapy should be based on the patient's clinical response and hemostasis evaluation.
The use of laboratory assessment(s) of coagulation (PT/INR, aPTT, FVII:C) does not necessarily correlate with or predict the hemostatic effectiveness of SEVENFACT.
Maximum tolerated doses have not been determined for SEVENFACT, and cumulative daily doses greater than 900 mcg/kg, which may be associated with greater risk of thromboembolic complications, have not been studied.
Dose adjustment may be required if the patient has received other procoagulant therapies prior to treatment with SEVENFACT.

Based on the clinical trial program for SEVENFACT, the recommended initial dose should be adjusted based on the criteria provided in Table 1.

### Micro-mechanical blood clot testing using smartphones [^112wY5Jo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The human body responds to injury with bleeding, followed by clot formation and eventually lysis. This carefully maintained homeostasis minimizes the risks of hemorrhage and inappropriate clotting like ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolus. However, for millions of people, medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves and genetic mutations increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from blood clotting. These individuals require lifelong administration of anticoagulation drugs such as warfarin, an effective medication but also one of the most common causes of hospitalization due to adverse drug events. Hence, medication effects must be closely monitored via frequent prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) tests to assess coagulation properties due to the drug's narrow therapeutic index and interactions with food and other medications. While newer anticoagulants that do not rely on regular PT/INR testing are increasing in popularity, studies show that warfarin remains the most commonly prescribed outpatient blood thinner.

PT/INR testing monitors extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. These tests are usually performed in a laboratory on expensive equipment after separating plasma from whole blood. Home PT/INR monitors directly utilize blood and have been shown to lengthen the amount of time spent in the therapeutic range, decrease the risk of thromboembolism in young patients and improve patient satisfaction and quality of life. Time spent in the therapeutic window benefits patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation on warfarin, since the risk of bleeding is five times higher with overly aggressive anticoagulation and the risk of ischemic events is three times higher with insufficient anticoagulation compared to levels in the therapeutic range.

Despite the existence of several home PT/INR testing modules, access to affordable and accurate PT/INR testing remains a challenge. Patients in the United States are in the therapeutic range only about 64% of the time. Patients in developing countries like Botswana, Uganda, and India are in this range, only 40% of the time due to less frequent testing –. Despite the potential for improvements from home PT/INR testing, these devices cost hundreds of dollars, limiting their utility in resource-constrained environments.

### Variability in international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time after injury are not explained by coagulation factor deficits [^112Y4fV4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional coagulation assays (CCAs), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), detect clotting factor (CF) deficiencies in hematologic disorders. However, there is controversy about how these CCAs should be used to diagnose, treat, and monitor trauma-induced coagulopathy. Study objectives were to determine whether CCA abnormalities are reflective of deficiencies of coagulation factor activity in the setting of severe injury.

Methods

Patients without previous CF deficiency within a prospective database at an ACS-verified Level I trauma center had CF activity levels, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels measured upon emergency department arrival from 2014 to 2017. Linear regression assessed how CF activity explained the aPTT and PT/INR variation. Prolonged CCA values were set as INR greater than 1.3 and aPTT greater than 34 seconds. CF deficiency was defined as less than 30% activity, except for fibrinogen, defined as less than 150 mg/dL.

Results

Sixty patients with a mean age of 35.8 (SD, 13.6) years and median New Injury Severity Score of 32 (interquartile range, 12–43) were included; 53.3% sustained blunt injuries, 23.3% required massive transfusion, and mortality was 11.67%. Overall, 44.6% of the PT/INR variance and 49.5% of the aPTT variance remained unexplained by CF activity. Deficiencies of CFs were: common pathway, 25%; extrinsic pathway, 1.7%; and intrinsic pathway, 6.7%. The positive predictive value for CF deficiencies were: (1) PT/INR greater than 1.3:4.4% for extrinsic pathway, 56.5% for the common pathway; (2) aPTT greater than 34 seconds:16.7% for the intrinsic pathway, 73.7% for the common pathway.

Conclusion

Almost half of the variances of PT/INR and aPTT were unexplained by CF activity. Prolonged PT/INR and aPTT were poor predictors of deficiencies in the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways; however, they were indicators of common pathway deficiencies.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and laboratory monitoring — Low molecular weight heparin and most DOACs may not cause derangements in activated PTT and/or PT/INR but still increase bleeding risk; routine laboratory monitoring is not required for patients receiving DOACs except for periodic assessment of renal function, and there is no US Food and Drug Administration–approved DOAC laboratory assay. All DOACs may affect routine coagulation tests without allowing reliable quantitative measurement; tests that may be used to evaluate for their presence include thrombin time, ecarin clotting time (dabigatran), and anti–factor Xa activity (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). Most clinical decisions concerning DOACs can be made beginning with creatinine clearance and time of last drug ingestion.

### Quality assurance program for whole blood prothrombin time-international normalized ratio point-of-care monitors used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation [^113Kunb7]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Whole blood coagulation monitors are increasingly used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation, but there are no comprehensive quality assurance (QA) programs to check their performance. We report on the experience with one of such programs applied in a field study where patients on prothrombin time (PT)-international normalized ratio (INR) self-testing were asked to bring their monitors to the anticoagulation clinic for checking. PT-INR testing was performed three times over 3 months with 14 patient's monitors and test strips on three recalcified QA plasmas by an experienced laboratory operator. Each patient was also asked to perform PT-INR self-testing (his/her own capillary blood) which was then compared to the laboratory PT-INR (plasma). Overall, the comparison between the observed and the consensus PT-INR on QA plasmas was acceptable with the majority of measurements lying within ± 15% or 20% of the consensus values. The comparison between the PT-INR self-testing and the laboratory method was also acceptable: overall, there was no statistical significant difference between the mean PT-INR values and the majority of paired measurements were less than 15% or 20% apart. In conclusion, our results show that the proposed QA scheme is feasible and may be implemented on a larger scale. Monitors should be recalled periodically to the clinic where they have been prescribed to the patient. During each visit, the clinic may check the monitors and patient self-testing performance as described. Such comprehensive QA system would make monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment by self-testing safer and more effective.

Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is monitored by the prothrombin time (PT) assay. The PT is standardized using international normalized ratios (INRs). By keeping the INR within specific values, it is possible to reduce potential complications from the treatment. To facilitate the PT monitoring, point-of-care devices suitable for capillary whole blood measurements have been developed. The aims of this study were to compare the INR values obtained by such a device, CoaguChek S, with those obtained from the Owren-type PT assay and to evaluate the differences seen.

Materials and Methods

In 351 consecutive warfarin-treated patients, INR was measured in capillary whole blood samples with CoaguChek S and was compared to venous plasma samples analyzed with the Owren PT method. Sixty-nine of these patients, including those deviating the most between the methods, were further evaluated according to levels of factor II (prothrombin), factor V, factor VII, factor X, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antiphospholipid antibodies.

Results

The results from CoaguChek S produced a correlation coefficient of 0.81 to the Owren-type PT assay and a concordance of 85.2%. Factor V and fibrinogen correlated significantly (p < 0.05) to the degree of deviation between the methods. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies did not influence the degree of deviation between the two methods.

Conclusions

INR analysis of whole blood with CoaguChek S is comparable with INR measured in plasma with Owren chemistry. The activities of factor V and fibrinogen contribute to the deviation seen between the methods. Differences in sensitivity to antiphospholipid antibodies could not be demonstrated.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^114ene9J]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Summary of the evidence — In cirrhosis across common procedures (paracentesis, thoracentesis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding, ERCP, colonoscopy with polypectomy, and liver biopsy), no randomized controlled trials used prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or platelet (PLT) counts to predict or manage procedural bleeding, and systematic review found no direct evidence of a predictive PT/INR or PLT threshold. Low-risk interventions reported either no bleeding or very low bleeding rates, and studies of variceal banding, colonoscopic polypectomy, and endoscopic sphincterotomy did not identify a specific PLT or PT/INR value that increased bleeding risk; rather, progressive decompensation (Child-Turcotte-Pugh) was a more likely marker. In liver biopsy, there was no clear difference in bleeding risk versus patients without cirrhosis and no specific PT/INR threshold, with a trend that lower PLT counts correlated with higher bleeding risk.

### Altered thrombin generation with prothrombin complex concentrate is not detected by viscoelastic testing: an in vitro study [^113DcyQy]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- The viscoelastic testing-derived parameters of clot initiation, clotting time (CT) and activated clotting time (ACT), might not reflect the clinically relevant interaction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors as revealed by thrombin generation assays.
- The ability of CT and ACT to indicate thrombin generation activity was tested in vitro in whole blood obtained from 13 healthy volunteers after simulated dilutional coagulopathy with or without spiking with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC).
- Dilution of whole blood markedly increased thrombin generation owing to imbalance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, with a further increase after spiking with 4F-PCC, whereas CT and ACT were prolonged.
- Treatment algorithms using prolonged CT and ACT as a trigger for administration of PCC to augment thrombin generation could result in dangerous hypercoagulability, a finding that should be confirmed in vivo.

Coagulopathy and severe bleeding are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Standard coagulation tests (SCTs), such as prothrombin time (PT), international normalised ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) time, are still used to diagnose coagulation abnormalities and serve as surrogate parameters for altered thrombin generation. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process. It cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, and activates platelets and a variety of procoagulants and anticoagulants. Impaired thrombin generation is related to a loss of coagulation factors as a result of dilution or consumption, hypothermia, acidosis, or use of antithrombotic agents such as vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. Critically low levels of thrombin generation are associated with a clinically apparent bleeding tendency. However, SCTs halt when only 5–7% of total thrombin is generated. Moreover, SCTs do not fully display the anticoagulant counterpart, which limits their use in assessing haemostatic balance in vivo and questions their use for predicting bleeding. Studies in trauma patients and patients with liver disease have demonstrated that despite prolonged SCTs, thrombin generation activity can be upregulated. In contrast, prolonged PT accurately displays diminished thrombin generation in warfarin-treated patients, whereas prolonged aPTT is a sound surrogate for reduced thrombin generation in patients with haemophilia. Thus, agreement between SCTs and thrombin generation is determined by the clinical scenario and ultimately by the underlying coagulation abnormality.

### Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate use for bleeding management in adult trauma [^113atFHM]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Coagulation therapy in clinical trauma settings is primarily guided by conventional coagulation assays or viscoelastic POC assays, as potential surrogate markers of thrombin generation. – In the Early Administration of Prothrombin Concentrate Complex in Patients With Acute Hemorrhage Following Severe Trauma (PROCOAG) multisite randomized clinical trial, the PT ratio (prothrombin time/laboratory normal reference value) was used to delineate trauma-related coagulation factor deficiency. Acute traumatic coagulopathy was defined by a PT ratio greater than 1.2, whereas severe acute traumatic coagulopathy was characterized by a PT ratio exceeding 1.5. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 mostly observational studies indicated that a dose of 20 to 30 IU/kg of 4F-PCC for TIC was typically initiated when coagulation analysis showed an INR of greater than or equal to 1.5 or a clotting time (CT) longer than 80 s in the extrinsically activated thromboelastometry (EXTEM) assay after administering fibrinogen concentrate. This approach did not significantly reduce mortality or increase venous thromboembolism. Current practices in large European trauma centers and European recommendations (e.g. European Trauma Guidelines)for managing trauma patients with major bleeding favor a coagulation factor concentrate-based management strategy. European guidelines state that after administering sufficient amounts of fibrinogen concentrate to achieve a fibrinogen level greater than 1.5 g/l, the EXTEM CT should be normalized using 4F-PCC if it remains prolonged. Data from two prospective studies in warfarin-treated individuals showed a strong correlation between reduced thrombin generation, INR, and CT prolongation in the EXTEM assay. These findings imply that EXTEM CT is more sensitive to coagulation factors II, X, and VII deficiencies than assays activated via the intrinsic contact pathway. Therefore, EXTEM CT could serve as a monitoring tool for 4F-PCC in trauma cases with deficiency in extrinsic pathway coagulation factors. Figure 1 provides a visual summary of a clinical monitoring and management approach for 4F-PCC based on surrogate markers of thrombin generation.

### Collection of blood specimens by venipuncture for plasma-based coagulation assays: necessity of a discard tube [^112Xz7LT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recently abandoned its recommendation for drawing a discard tube when performing a prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Because there is currently no evidence that a discard tube is necessary for more specialized coagulation assays, we studied the need for a discard tube for some of these tests. Blood was obtained from 88 subjects in 2 subsequent citrate tubes. Platelet-free plasma was tested for PT, APTT, antithrombin, protein C, and factors II, V, VIII, IX, and X. Difference and bias between tubes were tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Bland-Altman plots. For only APTT, antithrombin, and protein C was a small, statistically significant mean bias found (0.5 seconds; p = 0.001; -0.7%, P = 0.002; and -0.8%, P < .0001, respectively), but the bias of individual samples was not clinically relevant. This was also true for the other parameters tested. The recent CLSI recommendation that a discard tube is not necessary for PT/INR and APTT can be extended to include more specialized plasma-based coagulation assays as identified in this study.

WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF BLEEDING WITH CONCOMITANT USE OF VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS

Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking XELODA concomitantly with oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) have been reported in patients who were on stable doses of a vitamin K antagonist at the time XELODA was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating XELODA and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping XELODA. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases.

Monitor INR more frequently and adjust the dose of the vitamin K antagonist as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Laboratory tests used in the evaluation of hemostasis — The prothrombin time (PT) assesses the tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway and the activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) assesses the intrinsic pathway, but mild to moderate prolongation of these values has not been shown to predict bleeding risk in a nonbleeding patient; the International Normalized Ratio (INR) was developed to standardize warfarin monitoring and INR is calculated as PTRᴵˢᴵ with a WHO standard that has an ISI of 1.0. Other tests include thrombin time, fibrinogen assay, and D‑dimer; D‑dimers are produced by plasmin acting on cross‑linked fibrin and are used to diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation or to aid in ruling out acute thrombosis. Various coagulopathies, anticoagulant medications, or liver disease can cause abnormalities on these tests, and the entire clinical picture must be taken into consideration to understand the patient's true bleeding risk.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### Interactions between warfarin and three commonly prescribed fluoroquinolones [^115jeNN5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate a possible increased anticoagulant response during concomitant warfarin and fluoroquinolone therapy.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and MEDLINE, from inception to January 2008, combining the term warfarin individually with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. These 3 quinolones were selected based on their commercial availability and use in the US.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All publication types including human participants and published in English were eligible for review. Reports were selected based on the use of typical treatment courses of fluoroquinolones during concomitant warfarin therapy and the reporting of prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR).

Data Synthesis

Twenty-two publications were evaluated including 16 case reports or case series, 2 retrospective cohort studies, and 4 prospective studies, which included 2 placebo-controlled investigations. Identified reports covered a wide range of patient ages with multiple comorbidities. Changes in PT and INR values were considerably variable and inconsistent during concomitant warfarin and fluoroquinolone therapy. Results from the 6 structured reports demonstrated mean increases in PT and INR values that were clinically insignificant. However, some patients experienced significant increases above the desired therapeutic range. Increased anticoagulation was typically observed within the first week of concomitant fluoroquinolone therapy. Bleeding complications during times of increased anticoagulation were not always observed, but did result in death for 2 patients.

Conclusions

Published data show no consistent increase in anticoagulant effects during concomitant warfarin and 3 commonly prescribed fluoroquinolones. Therefore, more frequent monitoring during concomitant therapy would be prudent.

### Laboratory reporting of the international normalized ratio: progress and problems [^112fr4VB]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

The international normalized ratio (INR) is widely used to monitor oral anticoagulation and to evaluate patients with coagulation disorders.

Objective

To examine the variability of the performance and reporting of the INR and to evaluate laboratory calculation of the INR.

Design

Between 1993 and 2003, laboratories participating in proficiency testing were surveyed. Participants provided the international sensitivity index and the mean normal prothrombin time used to calculate the INR. The INR was calculated from the data provided and compared with the INR reported to determine if the calculation was correct.

Results

Survey data regarding the INR collected between 1993 and 2003 demonstrate an improvement in reporting, using appropriate anticoagulant, using lower international sensitivity index reagents, and matching international sensitivity index and prothrombin time method. The all-method coefficient of variation of the INR improved from 18% to 5.8%. Among 3813 laboratories studied in 2002 and 2003, 4.1% miscalculated INR. Of 29 laboratories that reported investigation of the INR miscalculation, 11 (38%) reported correcting an INR that was being reported in patient results and that this error was corrected as a result of the study. Since beginning grading of the INR calculation, miscalculation of the INR has fallen to less than 1%.

Conclusions

Recommendations for change in laboratory practice made by consensus conferences are implemented during the course of many years. Difficulty calculating the INR was documented, and both the calculation and the variability in the reporting of the INR showed improvement. Proficiency testing, when closely evaluated and acted on, can have a direct impact on the quality of patient care.

Monitoring treatment with antithrombotic drugs

There is no doubt that TG is decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in patients treated with any antithrombotic drug (e.g. heparins, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants). However, there is still no conclusive evidence that the TG procedure is superior for treatment monitoring to the APTT (unfractionated heparin), anti-factor Xa assays (low molecular weight heparin), the PT-International Normalized Ratio (warfarin) or the specific measurement of the plasma concentration of direct oral anticoagulants.

### European concerted action on anticoagulation. correction of displayed international normalized ratio on two point-of-care test whole-blood prothrombin time monitors (coaguChek mini and TAS PT-NC) by independent international sensitivity index calibration [^116oibRD]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

The international normalized ratio (INR) on two widely used point-of-care test (POCT) prothrombin time (PT) monitors (CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC) differed considerably and also differed from the 'true' INR obtained on the same samples using a manual PT and the same species thromboplastin international reference preparation. Agreement between the displayed INR and difference from 'true' INR has been reassessed following an independent international sensitivity index (ISI) calibration of the two systems. The displayed INRs taken at seven centres were compared with 'true' INRs from the same blood donations and INRs based on the resulting ISI. The overall difference between the displayed INRs on the two monitor systems was reduced from 21.0% to 3.5%. The overall difference in mean INR of system A from the 'true' INR was reduced from 19.0% to 9.5% and of system B from 6.8% to 0.3%, but individual centre's results still showed considerable mean INR variability. Differences between overall displayed INR with the two monitor systems have been reduced by an independent multicentre calibration, and agreement with 'true' INR on the same blood samples improved. However, marked variability in mean INR at individual centres remained after ISI correction, which demonstrates the need for external quality control of individual POCT whole-blood PT monitors.

### Reliability of point-of-care prothrombin time testing in a community clinic: a randomized crossover comparison with hospital laboratory testing [^112dB5AK]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

The success in achieving therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) targets in the control of warfarin using a whole-blood point-of-care testing (POCT) monitor (CoaguChek) in a community clinic was compared with hospital laboratory coagulometer prothrombin time (PT) testing in a randomized crossover study. Forty-six patients were randomized into two groups. At each visit, capillary blood was taken for the POCT monitor and venous blood for the laboratory coagulometer. In Group 1, for 6 months, dosage was based on the CoaguChek and for the second 6 months on the coagulometer. In the second group, the order was reversed. Dosages were determined using the dawn ac computer programme. Success was assessed by the percentage of time patients were maintained within the INR targets. Agreement between laboratory and monitor INR, and patient satisfaction were also assessed. Results with the POCT monitor compared well with the hospital coagulometer. Time in INR target range between the groups was similar, with 60.9% on the POCT monitor and 59.3% with the laboratory coagulometer in Group 1 and in Group 2, respectively, 64.3% and 63.4% with no significant difference in mean INR. An INR above 4.0 gave some discrepant results. International Sensitivity Index calibrations of the two test systems indicated that the INRs were dependable. Patient questionnaires showed greater satisfaction with community POCT monitoring.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^115tTzyU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — coagulopathy and bleeding management states that both prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated in PALF, yet abnormalities in these synthetic markers do not equate with bleeding risk because both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are reduced; clinically significant bleeding can occur. Initial management should look to improve the abnormality via administration of an age- and weight-appropriate dose of vitamin K therapy from 1 mg in infants to 10 mg in older adolescents. Oral vitamin K therapy should not be used to correct the INR in PALF; rather, subcutaneous administration should be used, while intramuscular and intravenous routes carry a Black Box warning for rare, but potentially serious side effects. Coagulopathy secondary to vitamin K deficiency should rapidly correct following repletion, and if coagulopathy persists, efforts to "correct" with fresh frozen plasma or other pro-coagulation products should generally be avoided because plasma transfusions transiently improve laboratory measures but have no proven benefit when given prophylactically and can instead contribute to volume overload; most centers will use plasma and/or platelet infusions before an invasive procedure or in the setting of life-threatening bleeding. Thromboelastography (TEG) is designed to incorporate all coagulation phases and has the promise to inform management decisions but requires additional study.

### Comparison and evaluation of a point-of-care device (coaguChek XS) to owren-type prothrombin time assay for monitoring of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin [^114FsaTo]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The standardized test used for evaluating the effect of warfarin is the prothrombin time (PT) which is measured and expressed in international normalized ratio (INR). Regular control of treatment intensity is required since inappropriate dosage increases the risk for complications. Portable point-of-care analytical instruments for measurement of capillary whole blood PT have been available for the last decades. The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate INR values obtained by the point-of-care device CoaguChek XS, to Owren PT in a hospital setting.

Materials and Methods

In 397 warfarin-treated patients, capillary whole blood was analyzed with the CoaguChek XS and the results were compared to analysis of venous plasma samples with the Owren PT assay. To study reproducibility and rule out preanalytical errors, a subgroup of 152 patients had two capillary blood samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS.

Results

In 397 patients, with a median age(± 2SD) of 69.0(50–88) years, there was a positive correlation between results from the CoaguChek XS and the Owren-type PT assay (r = 0.94; p < 0.001) and concordance of 88.2%. The mean INR difference (S.D) was 0.02 (0.22). Comparison of the 152 double samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS, produced a positive correlation of 0.99; p < 0.001.

Conclusions

The CoaguChek XS presents reproducible, highly comparable results with Owren PT at therapeutic levels of INR. The CoaguChek XS seems to produce better results than the earlier CoaguChek S, probably due to a new method of PT measurement where levels of fibrinogen and haematocrit do not affect the outcome.

### Association of prothrombin time, thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time levels with preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FMCWi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia (PE), an obstetric disorder, is categorized as mild PE if the patient's blood pressure (BP) ranges from 140/90 to 160/110 mmHg and they exhibit proteinuria of ≥ 1, and as severe PE if BP is ≥ 160/110 mmHg, with proteinuria exceeding 3 + along with edema and other significant symptoms. It affects approximately 2–5% of pregnancies globally, remaining one of the leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. Each year, approximately 4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with PE. Sadly, this disease claims the lives of an estimated 76,000 women, along with half a million fetuses and neonates, on a global scale annually.

Uncontrolled PE can result in maternal complications such as multi-organ failure, eclampsia, seizures, hemorrhagic stroke, adult respiratory distress syndrome, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), placental abruption, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal failure, and pulmonary edema. Neonatal complications may encompass intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, and mortality. In clinical practice, achieving precise diagnosis and consistently predicting PE has proven to be a challenging issue.

The pathophysiological changes observed in PE patients stem from vascular endothelial injury. Placental and immunologic irregularities prompt the release of inflammatory cytokines which trigger inflammatory responses, vascular endothelial injury, and the exposure of collagen and tissue factors beneath the endothelium. Consequently, alterations occurring in the hemostasis system. This sequence of events can lead to fetal demise in utero, dysontogenesis, and various adverse obstetrical outcomes.

Assessing the status of hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems in PE patients is crucial for determining disease severity, facilitating early clinical intervention, and improving the prognosis of maternal and infant health conditions. In clinical practice, commonly utilized laboratory tests for assessing hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis function include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), thrombin time (TT), antithrombin (AT), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), among others.

### Single-dose fluconazole for vulvovaginal candidiasis: impact on prothrombin time in women taking warfarin [^116khgnt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of a single oral 150-mg dose of fluconazole on the prothrombin time of women on long-term warfarin therapy.

Methods

Women on warfarin therapy for 6 months or more with no change in dose within 4 weeks of the study, and a prothrombin time (PT) with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 were invited to participate. Two consecutive baseline PTs were obtained (days -1 and 0), and women were given 150 mg of fluconazole. Prothrombin times were measured on days 2, 5, and 8 of the study. The change in PT was calculated from the difference between the baseline PT on day 0 and the PT during the study period. To detect a 10% difference in a PT (approximately 2.1 seconds) of a patient with an INR of 2.0, at P < .05 and a power of 90%, 5 subjects are required.

Results

Six women participated. The mean (± standard deviation) PT for day 0 was 27.7 ± 4.1 seconds or INR 2.6 ± 0.4. The PT increased 11% at day 2, 34% at day 5, and 2% at day 8; these differences were not statistically significant. However, one half of the women had either a clinically relevant increase of the INR greater than 4, or bleeding that required their dosage of warfarin to be decreased.

Conclusion

A single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole may increase the PT to a clinically relevant level in a woman on chronic warfarin therapy. Clinicians should monitor the PT carefully after a single dose of fluconazole.

### Daptomycin [^115EKi6C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.10 Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment

Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of daptomycin treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) < 50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min. Table 4 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.

In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in the daptomycin-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min (see Table 5). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 5 was not observed in comparator-treated patients.

Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.

5.11 Increased International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Prolonged Prothrombin Time

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing daptomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### International normalized ratio testing with point-of-care coagulometer in healthy term neonates [^116TUeKu]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Portable point-of-care (POC) analytical instruments for measurement of capillary whole blood prothrombin time (PT), which is expressed by the international normalized ratio (INR), have been available for the last decade, and the system offers convenient and accurate anticoagulant monitoring in adult patients. Using this method can reduce the volume of blood needed for tests, and capillary blood samples from heel pricks may provide a solution to difficult venous access. To date, however, only a few studies evaluating such portable coagulometers have been conducted in children, and no studies in neonates.

The main objectives of the present study were to establish reference intervals (RIs) of POC capillary puncture INR for a coagulation screening test in healthy term neonates and to evaluate factors that correlate with INR. In addition, we evaluated the validity and utility of the CoaguChek XS device in neonates.

5.10	Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment

Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of CUBICIN treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) < 50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with CUBICIN in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min. Table 5 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.

In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in the CUBICIN-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min (see Table 6). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 6 was not observed in comparator-treated patients.

Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.

5.11	Increased International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Prolonged Prothrombin Time

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.12	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing CUBICIN RF in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111FgiBQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is known as a risk factor for stroke. It was reported that approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke in Japan had AF complications. 1 Warfarin has been used to prevent AF‐associated stroke for more than 50 years, but warfarin treatment is a burden for patients and physicians because it requires a dose adjustment achieved by monitoring the prothrombin time–international normalized ratio (PT‐INR). Warfarin also interacts with food and many other drugs.

Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed to overcome these disadvantages of warfarin, and the efficacy and safety of NOACs have been tested in comparative studies with warfarin as a control. In recent years, several NOACs have become available. Based on the results of phase 3 clinical trials, Savelieva and Camm presented a chart (the Camm chart) to help physicians choose the best available NOAC in light of each patient's condition. 2 However, because the chart was created based on the results of international collaborative clinical trials, it must be used carefully for Japanese patients.

First, the therapeutic range of warfarin's PT‐INR for Japanese patients is different from that for patients in other countries. The range of 1.6 to 2.6 is recommended for Japanese elderly patients (age ≥ 70 years), whereas a range of 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended in the EU and US guidelines. 3 This difference in the therapeutic range in INR is based on the higher incidence of warfarin‐related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in Asians, including Japanese. 4

Based on the present review, therefore, we propose a method for selecting NOACs for Japanese patients with AF based on the results of subanalyses of Asian patients in the following clinical trials: Randomized Evaluation of Long‐term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE‐LY), 5 Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), 6 and Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE), 7 as well as the Japanese–ROCKET AF (J‐ROCKET AF) study in which Japanese patients participated. 8

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^112NQZsq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Hemostatic assessment in cirrhosis — Cirrhosis affects both prothrombotic and antithrombotic pathways, and the net effect is not accurately reflected by prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet (PLT) count. Very low PLT counts (e.g., < 50–75/μL) are independently associated with procedural bleeding and adverse postoperative outcomes, and studies tend to suggest that very low PLT counts (< 50/μL or < 75/μL) are associated with higher risk of bleeding; thrombocytopenia has been shown to independently predict adverse postoperative outcomes. PT/INR is not independently associated with procedural bleeding, and coagulopathy as measured by elevated PT/INR or PTT has not been independently associated with periprocedural bleeding in cirrhosis; INR is an important component of both the MELD and CTP scores because it is a very strong marker of liver dysfunction, which would not improve by measures aimed at directly correcting the INR. Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide a global functional assessment of clot formation and dissolution, but TEG and ROTEM are insensitive to von Willebrand factor and protein C and therefore may underestimate hemostatic function in patients with cirrhosis.

### A project to improve the management of patients on warfarin in a primary care setting through the introduction of a POC analysis [^115WChC6]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Warfarin is a widely used, relatively cheap, drug which decreases the risk of thrombosis or embolisations in patients with illnesses such as atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thrombo-embolism, and mechanical heart valves. Many patients have been treated with this drug for many years. Treatment with warfarin requires close monitoring with regular tests of PT-INR.

Recently, more expensive drugs such as NOAC have started to be used. These drugs have similar effects to warfarin but do not require the same close monitoring. Warfarin is still the most commonly used drug in Sweden. The monitoring can performed both in a hospital setting by anticoagulant clinics or in a primary care centre. The results of this monitoring, which is measured as TIR, are high in both settings at over 75%. In the Stockholm area most patients are monitored by their primary care centres.

Treatment with warfarin requires surveillance due to a narrow therapeutic range which is influenced by both dietary factors and other medications. The risk of dangerous side effects such as bleeding, or insufficient treatment which leads to thrombosis risk, can be minimized by monitoring. The drug's effect can be reversed by, e.g. administration by vitamin K. The effects of some NOACs are harder to reverse if bleeding should occur and NOACs are not accepted for use in patients with mechanical heart valves in Sweden. Warfarin thus constitutes a sustainable way to reduce the risk of thrombo-embolization.

The Tullinge Primary Care Centre operates its own laboratory. During the study period, the Owren PT test was used as the test of choice to determine PT-INR values. When the Owren PT test is performed shortly after the blood sample is taken, an otherwise time consuming centrifugation step can be omitted and PT-INR results can be available within 5 minutes. Since the Owren PT test is regarded as more robust and is cheaper than other tests, such as the CoaguChek XS, we use this latter test only in cases where the medical laboratory scientists are occupied or in some instances when tests are performed in the patient's home.

### Effects of sugammadex on coagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Pq6k8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sugammadex, a modified γ-cyclodextrin, is highly effective in reversing the muscle relaxant effects of rocuronium by binding with steroidal nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. This result in a faster and more predictable block reversal compared with traditional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine, and causes fewer unpleasant side effects. Common adverse events associated with sugammadex include vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.

A notable concern with sugammadex is its potential interference with hemostasis. While sugammadex has been shown to transiently prolong prothrombin time as measured by the international normalized ratio (PT[INR]) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), these changes typically resolve quickly and are not considered clinically significant. De Kam et al. demonstrated that sugammadex induces a dose-dependent but limited and transient increase in APTT and PT(INR), possibly due to its phospholipid-binding properties, which are primarily observed in vitro. However, conflicting evidence exists; for instance, Nilay et al. found no significant effect on coagulation time but reported a notable increase in postoperative bleeding.

Given the growing use of sugammadex in general anesthesia, it is critical to evaluate its potential impact on coagulation, as such effects could increase the risk of bleeding. This study aimed to systematically review and analyze existing evidence on the effects of sugammadex on coagulation.

Dabigatran laboratory monitoring — the prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) lack reliable correlation to dabigatran plasma levels and should not be used for monitoring; the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in a dose‑dependent but nonlinear fashion with considerable interindividual and interassay variability and can only provide rapid qualitative information in emergencies; the thrombin time (TT) and dilute TT (dTT) are best suited to monitor dabigatran, with the Hemoclot thrombin inhibitor assay routinely available, although these tests may not be readily available in many institutions.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^117AcC7a]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis — INR and conventional labs: All currently available laboratory measures of hemostasis have significant limitations in liver disease patients and lack adequate prospective data, especially as pre-procedure risk measures. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the most problematic because of its entrenched but unfounded position in traditional medical teaching, and the test is a mathematical manipulation of the prothrombin time that measures procoagulant factors I, II, V, VII, and X but does not measure the deficit of liver-derived anticoagulant factors, such as protein C. This causes significant variation in the INR in cirrhosis between different hospitals, depending on which thromboplastin is used in the test, and use of fresh frozen plasma to "correct" a prolonged INR in cirrhosis does not actually change thrombin production (factor II), but does exacerbate portal hypertension.

### Best practice advisory on ordering PT, INR, and PTT tests… [^117XZgod]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Demand for citrate products increased in early 2021 because of rising COVID-19 infection rates and their use in COVID-19 vaccine development and therapeutics. 1 Thus, a shortage ensued of 3. 2% sodium citrate laboratory tubes used primarily for prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and partial thromboplastin time testing. In this quality improvement study, a BPA was instituted on May 15, 2021, at 1 academic hospital for adult patients who were hospitalized or presented to the emergency department. When clinicians ordered a PT, INR, or PTT test without other coagulation tests, the electronic medical record displayed the message, "There is a national shortage on blue top tubes, and we request thoughtful restraint in reflexive ordering of PT/INR/PTT.

An interrupted time series design was used to analyze changes in rates of PT, INR, and PTT testing between 6 months before and 6 months after the BPA. Data were analyzed using Stata, version 17. The University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board deemed this study exempt from review because it was classified as a quality improvement study. The study followed the SQUIRE reporting guideline. Daily PT, INR, and PTT tests decreased from a mean 463. 8 tests per day before to
329. 0 per day after the BPA. The reduction after the BPA was –31. 4%, assuming that temporal trends before and after the BPA were the same, and –26. 0% when trends before and after the BPA were fitted separately.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated innovations to ensure the provision of evidence-based care during a worldwide shortage of laboratory tubes commonly used for PT, INR, and PTT testing. Our findings suggest the BPA was associated with an immediate decrease in ordering of these tests, and the reduction persisted for 6 months. The BPA informed clinicians of a nationwide problem they may not have known about. The inclusion of guidance on appropriate clinical scenarios within the EMR may have contributed to the success of this intervention as well. 5, 6.

### Class 1 device recall INRatio prothrombin time (PT… [^114a8GgT]. FDA (AccessData) (2002). Low credibility.

Date Initiated by Firm July 11, 2016 Date Posted August 19, 2016 Recall Status 1 Terminated 3 on July 20, 2017 Recall Number Z-2355–2016 Recall Event ID 74665 510Number. K020679 Product Classification Test, time, prothrombin Product Code GJS Product. INRatio Prothrombin Time Monitoring System Model Number: 0100007 Product Usage: The INRatio Prothrombin Time Monitoring System uses a modified version of the one-stage PT test. After a drop of blood is applied to the test strip, it is drawn into the test area and mixed with reagents that cause coagulation to begin. The test strip area on the test strip is separated into three channels, each of which contains electrodes for detection of the blood clot. One channel contains the reagents to perform the Prothrombin time test on the blood sample. The other two channels contain the reagents. to perfom the Prothrombin time test on the blood sample. The other two channels contain the reagents to run control tests.

No external quality control test are required for the INRatio System. The meter monitors the reactions, and calculates the PT and INR for the blood sample, which are reported on the display. If the control results are not within a set range, it indicates a problem with the test and an error message is reported on the display instead of a result. Alere San Diego is initiating a voluntary recall for the Alere INRatio/INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems. This action is being initiated as a result of patients who had a therapeutic or near-therapeutic INR with the Alere INRatio/INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring System but a significantly higher INR when performed by a central laboratory.
