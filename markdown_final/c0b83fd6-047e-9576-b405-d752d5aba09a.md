## Question

54 yo M with chronic alcoholism and mild, stable transaminitis is admitted for community-acquired pneumonia; started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On day 3, mild confusion develops; LFTs up slightly. Plan is to switch to oral linezolid for discharge to complete antibiotic course. Is this safe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether switching to oral linezolid is safe for a 54-year-old man with chronic alcoholism, mild stable transaminitis, new mild confusion on day 3 of CAP therapy, and slightly rising LFTs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and guideline-concordant therapy for CAP. Then, I should verify linezolid's hepatic safety and whether dose adjustment is needed in mild liver disease. Next, I will examine neurotoxicity risk, especially early-onset encephalopathy in alcohol use disorder. After that, I need to check for drug–drug interactions, particularly with SSRIs, and consider serotonin toxicity. Finally, I will review hematologic risks, monitoring, and whether an alternative oral step-down would be safer before concluding with a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indication and guideline context. Linezolid is an option for CAP when MRSA is suspected or confirmed, but it is not first-line empiric therapy in the absence of MRSA risk factors; standard regimens are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, with total durations often 5–7 days once clinically stable, so I need to ensure MRSA coverage is actually indicated here before choosing linezolid [^117JT7za] [^11422hz5].

> Wait, let me verify hepatic safety and dosing in liver disease. The FDA labeling states no dose adjustment is required in Child-Pugh A (mild) hepatic impairment, and the provided sources do not list a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, though rare liver injury has been reported with prolonged therapy; thus, mild stable transaminitis alone does not mandate dose change or avoidance of linezolid, though I should monitor LFTs if I proceed [^112HY2QK] [^1159sTyL] [^115zDZbd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neurotoxicity. I initially thought linezolid's neurotoxicity is typically delayed and only with prolonged use, but I should double-check that assumption. There are case reports of early-onset linezolid-associated encephalopathy within 1–2 days, particularly in patients with alcohol use disorder, so the patient's new confusion on day 3 raises a red flag even before discharge planning; I need to ensure we do not attribute this to alcohol withdrawal without considering drug-induced encephalopathy [^114u3iHA].

> I need to check for serotonin syndrome risk next. Linezolid is a reversible MAO inhibitor and can precipitate serotonin syndrome with serotonergic antidepressants; although newer observational data suggest the absolute risk is low, the consequence is serious, and given the patient already has altered mentation, I should confirm concomitant serotonergic medications and, if present, avoid linezolid or use extreme caution with close monitoring [^116EZsJi] [^113hYXjS].

> Let me consider hematologic toxicity and monitoring. Myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia, is dose- and duration-related and more likely with prolonged therapy or elevated troughs; for a short 5–7 day CAP course, the risk is lower, but I should still plan CBC monitoring if linezolid is used, especially beyond a week or if there are concerning symptoms [^115yZiJR] [^11462DMd].

> But wait, what if the confusion reflects hepatic encephalopathy from underlying alcoholic liver disease rather than linezolid toxicity. I should confirm whether there are stigmata of cirrhosis or prior HE episodes and, if suspected, manage per hepatic encephalopathy protocols and avoid adding a potentially neurotoxic agent until the mental status is clarified; this is particularly important because infection itself can precipitate HE in alcohol-related liver disease [^114o2wUM].

> I will now examine safer oral step-down options if MRSA is not strongly suspected. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin are guideline-supported oral alternatives for CAP with comorbidities; given the patient's alcohol use disorder and current confusion, avoiding linezolid's neurotoxic potential seems prudent unless there is a compelling MRSA indication or intolerance to alternatives [^117JT7za].

> Let me reconsider the original plan. Switching to oral linezolid for convenience is tempting due to excellent bioavailability, but the combination of new confusion and alcohol use disorder shifts the risk–benefit balance unfavorably for linezolid right now; I should confirm MRSA risk factors and, if none are present, choose a non-MAOI oral regimen and reassess mental status before discharge, reserving linezolid only if MRSA is confirmed or strongly suspected and alternatives are unsuitable [^117JT7za] [^114u3iHA].

> Final recommendation: No, switching to oral linezolid is not the safest choice at this time given early-onset neurotoxicity risk in alcohol use disorder, the patient's new confusion, and the lack of a clear MRSA indication; I recommend an alternative oral step-down such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if clinically appropriate, with close monitoring of mental status and LFTs, and I would reserve linezolid for confirmed MRSA or when no suitable alternatives exist with vigilant monitoring for neuropsychiatric changes and hematologic toxicity [^117JT7za] [^114u3iHA] [^115yZiJR].

---

Switching to **oral linezolid** is not safe in this patient because of the risk of **early-onset neurotoxicity** [^114u3iHA] (confusion, encephalopathy) in chronic alcoholism and the potential for **serotonin syndrome** if serotonergic drugs are used. Linezolid is also associated with **myelosuppression** [^115yZiJR] and lactic acidosis, especially with prolonged use or hepatic impairment. Given the patient's mild transaminitis and new confusion, linezolid should be avoided. Preferred oral step-down options include amoxicillin-clavulanate, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), or doxycycline, selected based on local resistance and patient factors [^117JT7za].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and hepatic considerations

Linezolid is **primarily metabolized by non-enzymatic oxidation**, with minimal hepatic metabolism, and no dose adjustment is required in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [^112HY2QK]. However, in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), caution is advised due to potential increased exposure and risk of adverse effects [^116XkwJU]. The patient's mild, stable transaminitis suggests no immediate contraindication to linezolid use, but ongoing monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.

---

## Neurotoxicity risk in chronic alcoholism

Chronic alcohol use is a significant risk factor for **linezolid-associated neurotoxicity**, including encephalopathy, confusion, and serotonin syndrome [^114u3iHA]. Case reports describe early-onset encephalopathy occurring within days of initiating linezolid therapy, particularly in patients with alcohol use disorder [^114u3iHA]. Given the patient's recent onset of mild confusion, introducing linezolid may exacerbate neurological symptoms and delay recovery.

---

## Serotonin syndrome risk

Linezolid is a reversible **monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)** and can interact with serotonergic medications, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome — a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities [^113hYXjS]. Although the patient is not currently on serotonergic medications, the risk remains significant if such agents are introduced during or after linezolid therapy.

---

## Hematologic toxicity and myelosuppression

Linezolid is associated with **myelosuppression**, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, particularly with prolonged use (> 2 weeks) or in patients with pre-existing hematologic conditions [^115yZiJR]. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts is recommended during therapy. The patient's chronic alcohol use may further increase the risk of hematologic complications.

---

## Lactic acidosis risk

Linezolid has been associated with **lactic acidosis**, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with hepatic impairment [^115zDZbd]. Although the patient's liver dysfunction is mild, the combination of chronic alcohol use and potential mitochondrial toxicity from linezolid increases the risk of lactic acidosis.

---

## Alternative oral antibiotic options

Given the risks associated with linezolid, **alternative oral antibiotic options** for community-acquired pneumonia include:

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: 875/125 mg orally twice daily [^117JT7za].
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin 750 mg orally once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily [^117JT7za].
- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally twice daily [^117JT7za].

These alternatives provide effective coverage for common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens and are generally well-tolerated in patients with mild hepatic impairment.

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

Given the patient's clinical presentation and risk factors, **linezolid is not recommended** for oral step-down therapy. Instead, consider one of the alternative oral antibiotics listed above, selected based on local resistance patterns, patient allergies, and comedications. If linezolid is absolutely necessary (e.g. MRSA confirmed), close monitoring for neurotoxicity, hematologic toxicity, and lactic acidosis is essential, with regular assessment of mental status, complete blood counts, and liver function tests.

---

Switching to **oral linezolid** is not safe for this patient due to the risks of neurotoxicity, serotonin syndrome, myelosuppression, and lactic acidosis. Alternative oral antibiotics should be considered, with careful monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters.

### Early onset probable linezolid-induced encephalopathy [^114u3iHA]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Linezolid is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of gram-positive pathogens. While neurological complications with linezolid are rare, long-term exposure can be associated with neurotoxic effects. Patients with pre-existing neurologic sequelae or risk factors, such as alcohol abuse, diabetes, or concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents and/or antiretroviral therapy, may be more susceptible to the development of linezolid-induced neurotoxicity. We describe a 41-year-old male who developed early onset encephalopathy after a day and a half of linezolid therapy. Our patient had at least one significant risk factor (alcoholism), making linezolid-induced encephalopathy probable based upon the Naranjo probability scale. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for early onset linezolid-induced neurotoxicity, particularly in patients with concomitant risk factors.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

[See Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Community-Acquired Pneumonia

The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250 mg tablets to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

2.2 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1126Mtbw]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and cautions: Duration — For most patients, 5–7 days, and patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics; longer duration is often required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII), and patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AII).

### Safety and tolerability of a short course of linezolid for the treatment of predominantly moderate to severe tuberculous meningitis in adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^115SfRUq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse events occurred in 10% of participants, most of whom did not receive linezolid. Two instances of grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia with grade 2 elevation in alanine aminotransferase occurred, both in participants on high-dose rifampin without linezolid. In one of them, study drugs were temporarily discontinued and successfully resumed without recurrence of liver injury. In the other participant, the abnormal liver function test results occurred at the conclusion of the 4-week interventional period. The incidence of drug-induced liver injury was comparable to that observed in the LASER-TBM study but lower than in the ESCALATE (Linezolid As An Add On Treatment in the Intensive Phase of Tubercular Meningitis) trial (Clinical Trials Registry–India CTRI/2019/06/019501), in which elevated aminotransferase levels developed in 31% of participants receiving conventional antituberculosis therapy with or without linezolid. The higher prevalence of transaminitis in the ESCALATE trial, a single-center study in India, is in line with recent data suggesting that Asian race may be a risk factor for drug-induced liver injury. However, the proportions of participants in the ESCALATE study with liver injury did not differ significantly by linezolid treatment status.

While most treatment-limiting toxicities associated with linezolid are reversible, neurologic toxic effects, including painful, sensory-predominant peripheral neuropathy and optic neuropathy, can be permanent. The median time to onset of neuropathy associated with linezolid is often > 2 months, and in some studies > 6 months. However, many of these studies have been of patients treated with lower-dose linezolid, typically 600 mg/d. In the ZeNix study, among 46 participants who received linezolid 1200 mg/d for 9 weeks, 15 adverse events suggestive of peripheral neuropathy occurred. Likewise, even with the short duration of linezolid in our trial, signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy developed in 4 participants, of whom 3 were on linezolid. Reassuringly, on repeat testing after the conclusion of 4 weeks of linezolid treatment, all evaluable participants experienced complete resolution of signs and symptoms of neuropathy.

Table 3 — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — first-choice parenteral therapy includes ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime, 35–50 mg/ kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/ day) IV. For children who are receiving effective cART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other community-acquired pneumonia pathogens, add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected, and for patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

Invasive bacterial infection treatment — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed/infected children: First-choice parenteral options are ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime 35–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/day) IV. For children receiving effective cART with mild/no immunosuppression and mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, an oral option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat common atypical pathogens; add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected. In patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma, or an indwelling venous catheter, consider antipseudomonal regimens such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone. Consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in severe pneumonia or advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults with HIV — duration and IV-to-PO switch: For most patients, duration of therapy is 5–7 days; the patient should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and should be clinically stable before discontinuation of therapy. Longer duration of antibiotics is often required when severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus infection. A switch from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) therapy should be considered for patients who have improved clinically, can swallow and tolerate oral medications, and have intact gastrointestinal function (BIII).

### Linezolid-induced pancytopenia [^1161PzAT]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Linezolid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic of the Oxazolidinone class; it works by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis on bacterial ribosomes. Due to its excellent bioavailability after oral dosing, it has become an important tool in combating multi-drug-resistant bacteria including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Side effects are multiple and potentially serious. We report the case of an 87-year-old man who developed pancytopenia secondary to a 6-week course of linezolid. Withdrawal of the antibiotic was decided as the treatment and resolution of the pancytopenia was evident within 2 weeks. Clinicians should be aware of this side effect of linezolid therapy and that weekly full blood count monitoring is paramount.

### Linezolid: its role in the treatment of gram-positive, drug-resistant bacterial infections [^115z4AzZ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

While the choices available for the management of gram-positive, drug-resistant bacterial infections are becoming limited, antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly problematic because of the widespread overuse of antibiotics. Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic belonging to a new class of antimicrobials called the oxazolidinones. Linezolid disrupts bacterial growth by inhibiting the initiation process of protein synthesis — a mechanism of action that is unique to this class of drugs. It is well absorbed with high bioavailability that allows conversion to oral therapy as soon as the patient is clinically stable. It has been approved for certain gram-positive infections including certain drug-resistant enterococcus, staphylococcus, and pneumococcus strains. It is generally well tolerated, with myelosuppression being the most serious adverse effect. As a nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, caution is recommended when used with adrenergic or serotonergic agents (e.g., tyramine, dopamine, pseudoephedrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Judicious use of this medication should help physicians treat patients with multidrug-resistant infections.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Linezolid: the first oxazolidinone antimicrobial [^112RqBHa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Linezolid is the first of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the oxazolidinones, to be approved for clinical use in the United States and elsewhere. The drug is a totally synthetic compound, which lessens the likelihood of naturally occurring resistance mechanisms. It has excellent activity against virtually all important gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, macrolide-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Development of resistance to the compound has been infrequent thus far. Linezolid is 100% bioavailable, so it can be given in equal doses orally or parenterally. Its elimination half-life allows dosing twice per day, and alteration of drug dosage is not required in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Linezolid has approved indications for skin and soft tissue infections; lower respiratory tract infections; and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia. The drug has an acceptable profile of adverse events, but reversible myelosuppression has occurred in patients receiving high doses for more than 2 weeks.

### Linezolid: a review of safety and tolerability [^112fRmxP]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Linezolid has demonstrated activity against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. The availability of intravenous and oral formulations, with near 100% bioavailability of the latter, is hoped to facilitate the management of multiply drug-resistant Gram-positive infections. Linezolid was approved for clinical use in the United States in April 2000 and has subsequently been approved in other countries for the management of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, including cases with concurrent bacteremia. Additional studies have demonstrated potential use in febrile cancer patients with neutropenia, and case reports have documented some efficacy in the management of infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, nocardiosis, and in anaerobic infections. Given the potential for significantly increased use of linezolid, a thorough review and update of its tolerability and safety profile is warranted.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adults:

The safety of linezolid formulations was evaluated in 2046 adult patients enrolled in seven Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trials, who were treated for up to 28 days.

Of the patients treated for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs), 25.4% of linezolid-treated and 19.6% of comparator-treated patients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event. For all other indications, 20.4% of linezolid-treated and 14.3% of comparator-treated patients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event.

Table 2 shows the incidence of all-causality, treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of adult patients in these trials by dose of linezolid.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^112ENfbz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Efficacy and safety of oral and early-switch therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^112WGZRC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine the safety, efficacy, and cost of oral therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In patients with nonsevere pneumonia, conventional (parenteral) treatment was compared with the oral route; in patients with severe pneumonia, conventional treatment was compared with early switch from parenteral to oral therapy.

Subjects and Methods

We randomly assigned 85 hospitalized patients with nonsevere pneumonia to one of two groups: 41 received oral antimicrobials from admission, and 44 received parenteral antimicrobials until they had been afebrile for 72 hours before switching to oral treatment. We randomly assigned 103 patients with severe pneumonia who had initially been treated with parenteral antimicrobials to one of two groups: 48 were switched to oral therapy after 48 hours of treatment (early switch), and 55 received a full 10-day course of parenteral antibiotics.

Results

Among patients with nonsevere pneumonia, there were no deaths in the oral treatment group, and one death (2%) in the parenteral treatment group (95% confidence interval [CI] for between-group [oral minus parenteral] difference: -7% to 2%, P = 0.3). The time to resolution of morbidity was ≤ 5 days in 34 (83%) patients in the oral treatment group and 39 (88%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.5); there were treatment failures in 4 (10%) patients in the oral treatment group and 14 (32%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.02). Among patients with severe pneumonia, there was one (2%) death in the early-switch group and no deaths in the full course of parenteral antibiotics groups (95% CI for between-group [early switch vs. full course] difference: -2% to 6%, P = 0.5). The time to resolution of morbidity was ≤ 5 days in 38 (79%) patients in the early-switch group and 41 (75%) in the full-course group (P = 0.3). There were 12 (25%) treatment failures in the early-switch group and 13 (24%) in the full-course group (P = 0.9). There were fewer adverse events in the oral and early-switch groups, primarily due to lower rates of infusion-related phlebitis. Significant cost savings, mainly due to a shorter hospitalization, occurred among patients with severe pneumonia in the early-switch group.

Conclusion

Inpatients with nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia can be effectively and safely treated with oral antimicrobials from the time of admission, whereas those with severe pneumonia can be treated with early-switch therapy.

5.1 Risks Associated with the Combination Treatment Regimen

Pretomanid Tablet is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid. Refer to the prescribing information for bedaquiline and linezolid for additional risk information. Warnings and Precautions related to bedaquiline and linezolid also apply to their use in the combination regimen with Pretomanid Tablets.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic adverse reactions were reported with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor symptoms and signs (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, and hepatomegaly) and laboratory tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) at a minimum at baseline, at two weeks, and then monthly while on treatment and as needed. If evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction occurs, test for viral hepatitides and discontinue other hepatotoxic medications. Interrupt treatment with the entire regimen if:

Aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by total bilirubin elevation greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal.
Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 8 times the upper limit of normal.
Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and persist beyond 2 weeks.

### The safety and tolerability of linezolid in novel short-course regimens containing bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid to treat rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^1141yBCs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Every year there are approximately half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) diagnosed globally, with 150 000 deaths. Over the last decade, the treatment success rate for patients with MDR/RR-TB has increased from 50% to 60%. New and repurposed antibiotics promise to shorten the duration, improve the tolerability, and improve the efficacy of treatment for MDR/RR-TB: Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to the 2 most effective, first-line anti-TB antibiotics, isoniazid and rifampicin.

Between 2019 and 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended regimens, based on data from programmatic settings, for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB included a minimum of 5 drugs. These included the 3 most effective "group A drugs" (bedaquiline, linezolid, and a fluoroquinolone), where tolerated and susceptible. The treatment duration recommended in these guidelines varied from a 9-month ("short course") regimen, for selected patients to a longer 18-month regimen. However, toxicity commonly associated with these regimens included hepatotoxicity and hematological and neurological toxicity due to the use of injectable agents and prolonged therapy.

In 2022, WHO commissioned a revision to the MDR/RR-TB treatment guidelines, following the completion of clinical trials that evaluated all-oral regimens including the antibiotics bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), and linezolid (L). The TB pragmatic clinical trial for a more effective, concise and less toxic regimen (PRACTECAL), Nix, and ZeNix trials evaluated treatment outcomes of a number of BPaL regimens, with varying linezolid doses. The safety of regimens containing BPaL, with or without the addition of a fourth antimicrobial agent (henceforth, called BPaL-containing regimens), remains an important consideration. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that has been repurposed for use in treatment of TB. Particularly at high doses, linezolid has been associated with peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy, and bone marrow toxicity. In contrast, bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline that blocks ATP synthase, and pretomanid, a nitroimidazole, are generally well tolerated. However, QT prolongation and hepatotoxicity have been reported.

### Case report: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and COVID-19 coinfection in port-au-prince, Haiti [^113QAK5c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential increased risk of drug interactions.

The WHO recommends MDR-TB treatment regimens to include bedaquiline, linezolid, and fluoroquinolone with addition of clofazimine or cycloserine to achieve at least four effective drugs. These medications carry potential adverse side effects that may be exacerbated by symptoms associated with COVID-19. Bedaquiline, fluoroquinolones, and clofazimine can all cause QTc prolongation.SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with cardiac involvement and myocardial inflammation, although the specific impact of this on patient outcomes is unknown. It is possible that the use of these antituberculous drugs in COVID-19 patients may induce more severe cardiac manifestations. Patients with COVID-19 can present with elevated liver function enzymes which may prevent the use of bedaquiline, a drug known for being hepatotoxic. The use of linezolid, another core drug in MDR-TB regimens, is associated with bone marrow toxicity. A unique sign of COVID-19 is the presence of lymphopenias, which we saw in our MDR-TB patient in Haiti and which 90% of patients in a New York City cohort demonstrated. Management of MDR-TB in people living with HIV is complicated by higher rates of drug toxicities that may be exacerbated in the setting of COVID-19 coinfection. The use of steroids in severe COVID-19 decreases mortalityand may serve a role in reducing drug interactions in coinfected patients although more research is needed. To ensure that patients with both MDR-TB and COVID-19 are effectively managed, increased laboratory monitoring for lymphopenia, transaminitis, and arrhythmias is warranted. Multidrug-resistant TB medications may need to be held if such abnormalities occur.

### Association of linezolid with risk of serotonin syndrome in patients receiving antidepressants [^116EZsJi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The evidence for rare and serious adverse events associated with antibiotics often comes from retrospective, population-based observational studies, such as our study. This evidence has limitations due to the nature of retrospective observational studies. As well, such studies are not efficient because they often focus on a particular adverse event. Future research should move beyond observational studies to phase 4 studies, which would prospectively monitor for all types of adverse events. While waiting for higher-quality evidence, our study adds to the existing evidence for the safety of linezolid even in the context of concomitant antidepressants. Based on the existing evidence, clinicians should be reassured that it appears safe to prescribe oral linezolid to patients taking antidepressants, especially if there are limited antibiotic options or alternative antibiotic options would be inferior.

Oxazolidinones

Linezolid is available in IV and oral formulations. Linezolid provides an option for early switch to oral therapy, and dose reduction is not necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Linezolid has shown to be active against many resistant gram-positive organisms including MRSA, VRE, and macrolide-resistant streptococci. In a study of patients with ABSSSIs due to MRSA, compared with vancomycin, linezolid-treated patients had significantly higher clinical and microbiological success rates at the end of treatment. Linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia and anemia are typically mild, reversible, and duration dependent. There is an interaction between linezolid and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Tedizolid, a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor, can be administered once daily, either orally or IV at equivalent doses. In 2 randomized trials, treatment with tedizolid for 6 days was shown to be noninferior to linezolid for 10 days. In addition, differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs have been observed between tedizolid and linezolid, possibly due to the effects of these agents on intestinal flora. The effect of tedizolid on normal intestinal flora has been shown to be limited and reversible, and another study showed that linezolid led to marked changes in gut flora composition. Further, the less frequent dosing with tedizolid (once daily vs twice daily with linezolid) may also somewhat reduce the overall risk of developing gastrointestinal AEs.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and Clindamycin

Several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin for the treatment of uncomplicated ABSSSIs. In a study of uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses treated with drainage, adjunctive treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 7 days resulted in higher cure rates compared with placebo. In another randomized study of uncomplicated wound infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin were similarly effective with comparable cure rates and AEs. A randomized clinical trial involving adults and children found no differences between clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in efficacy or safety for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. However, the development of new infections by 1 month of follow-up was lower in the clindamycin-treated group. Neither of these 2 antibiotics has been evaluated in a head-to-head comparison with the newer MRSA-active antibiotics.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Top POEMs of 2024… [^117SpgQq]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Continue treating community-acquired pneumonia the way you're doing it. It's difficult, given the existing research data, to determine big differences in the clinical impact of the various oral antibiotics used for initial treatment. Using clarithromycin as the standard, telithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and the quinolones levofloxacin and nemonoxacin produce similar benefits with regard to clinical response and mortality. Mark H. Ebell, MD, MS Professor Michigan State University East Lansing, MI Clinical question Is antibiotic treatment more effective than placebo in resolving symptoms of acute sinusitis in children. Bottom line Though this study was a meta-analysis, the data largely come from a single study, which showed a substantial benefit, after a few weeks, to using amoxicillin with or without clavulanate to treat children with symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Mark H. Ebell, MD, MS Professor Michigan State University East Lansing, MI Clinical question Does titrated low-dose amitriptyline improve symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome who have failed first-line therapies. Bottom line In this study, composed largely of adults with IBS-D and IBS-M with at least moderate severity despite first-line therapy, titrated low dose amitriptyline was more effective than placebo in improving symptoms. The researchers randomized the patients to receive titrated low-dose amitriptyline or matching placebo. More than 80% of the participants had IBS with diarrhea or with mixed diarrhea and constipation. The initial dose of amitriptyline was 10 mg every evening and the dose was increased over 3 weeks to a maximum of 30 mg.

After 6 months, participants in both groups improved, but the amitriptyline-treated participants had a greater degree of improvement: 27 points better in their intention-to-treat analysis; the authors report, however, that 35 points is the minimum clinically important difference. More important, 61% of the amitriptyline-treated group reported meaningful improvement compared with 45% of those receiving placebo.

### Severe drug-induced liver injury associated with prolonged use of linezolid [^115zDZbd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

This study aims to describe a patient developing concomitant severe liver failure and lactic acidosis after long-term treatment with linezolid. A 55-year-old Caucasian woman developed concomitant severe liver failure and lactic acidosis after a treatment with linezolid for 50 days because of infected hip prosthesis. Other causes of liver failure and lactic acidosis were excluded by extensive diagnostic workup. A liver biopsy showed microvesicular steatosis. As linezolid toxicity was considered to be the cause of the lactic acidosis and the severe hepatic failure, the antibiotic was withdrawn. After 4 days of supportive therapy and hemodialysis, the serum lactate level returned within normal limits. The prothrombin time ratio and thrombocytes recovered within 2 weeks. Bilirubin levels normalized within 14 weeks. Since no other cause could be identified, liver injury was considered to be drug-related. Resolution of the hepatotoxicity occurred after discontinuation of linezolid, supportive treatment measures, and hemodialysis. Both lactic acidosis and microvesicular steatosis after the use of linezolid are related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Ucalf Causality Assessment Method scale revealed that the adverse drug event was probable. Prolonged exposure to linezolid may induce severe hepatotoxicity. Clinicians should be aware of this possible adverse effect especially in case of long-term treatment.

### Proposed linezolid dosing strategies to minimize adverse events for treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis [^116VQdQv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, linezolid is among the most effective drugs for MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Although linezolid trough levels > 2 mg/L have been associated with linezolid-related adverse events in patients with XDR-TB, many patients (42%) with trough levels ≤ 2 mg/L still develop adverse events. Moreover, trough levels are difficult to collect and measure in practice. Information is limited about optimal dosages, treatment durations, and best practices for linezolid in TB to maintain efficacy while minimizing adverse events. Here, using data from Nix-TB, we evaluated relationships between linezolid dosing, plasma concentrations, and time course of major toxicities. We provide practical, data-driven recommendations about linezolid dosing.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^111Zef8a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Routine blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinary antigen testing are not beneficial in patients with nonsevere CAP.
- The Pneumonia Severity Index is recommended to determine the need for hospitalization, whereas the ATS/IDSA criteria for severe CAP are recommended to predict the need for intensive care.
- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Diagnostic Testing BLOOD AND SPUTUM CULTURES Routine blood and sputum cultures have not been shown to improve patient outcomes in CAP. Sputum cultures are recommended before treatment initiation only if the patient has severe CAP, and particularly if he or she is intubated; if the patient has a history of methicillin-resistant.

URINARY ANTIGEN TESTING Urinary antigen testing for Legionella or pneumococcus has not been shown to improve outcomes. Based on low-quality evidence, the ATS/IDSA guideline suggests that routine urine testing for pneumococcal antigen be performed only in severe cases of CAP and that urine testing for Legionella antigen be performed only in cases of severe CAP, exposure to a Legionella outbreak, or travel to an endemic area. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia. Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes.

Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy. Editor's Note: This ATS/IDSA guideline was produced before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has altered the diagnosis and management of lower respiratory tract infections. The current version of this guideline limits testing and antiviral treatment in patients with influenza, and we expect testing for and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection to become a long-standing element of standard pneumonia care.

### Oral regimens for rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible tuberculosis [^117A7NtB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Consistent results across all analyses support the non-inferior efficacy of three regimens (9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, and 9BDLLfxZ) compared to the standard of care. These three regimens each produced favorable outcomes in more than 85% of participants at week 73; this represents an improvement over global averages and is comparable to trial results with the BPaLM regimen (88%).

Death was uncommon despite the substantial burden of comorbidities and cavitary disease. Grade 3 or higher AEs were frequent across all groups, but typically considered by the site investigator as unrelated to study drugs. Although the study was not powered for statistical comparison of safety outcomes, we observed some patterns. Grade 3 or higher hepatoxicity was more common in experimental groups, except in 9BDLLfxZ, than in the control. Pyrazinamide, included in all experimental groups and almost 50% of the control regimens, can cause elevated liver enzymes, as can bedaquiline, fluoroquinolones, and linezolid; this can be aggravated by alcohol use and active hepatitis B or C infection, which were present in the cohort. – Linezolid-related toxicities were generally less frequent in experimental groups than in the control and this may reflect a safety benefit of routinely lowering the weekly dose of linezolid at 16 weeks or earlier. – QTcF intervals of > 500 ms were infrequent and occurred only in groups containing clofazimine and a second major QT prolonger, bedaquiline or moxifloxacin. These results are consistent with emerging evidence about the safety of bedaquiline in combination with other QT-prolonging anti-TB drugs.

### Linezolid for drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis [^112rca35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Linezolid was categorized as a 'Group 5' drug in the 2011 WHO drug‐resistant tuberculosis guidelines (WHO 2011). Medications assigned to this group were not recommended for use as core drugs, due to insufficient evidence detailing their safety or efficacy. However, the 2016 WHO update re‐allocated it as a 'Group C: other core second‐line agent', prioritizing its use over some more traditional agents (WHO 2016a). The number of linezolid‐treated patients included in reviews of evidence informing both the 2011 and 2016 WHO guidance was insufficient to provide efficacy and safety estimates (WHO 2011, Fox 2017). In 2018, in a rapid communication from the WHO on treatment of MDR‐TB and rifampicin‐monoresistant‐TB, linezolid's position was further upgraded to a 'group A: Medicines to be prioritised' (WHO 2018). A summary of evidence for the 2018 recommendation has been published (Ahmad 2018).

Despite the promoted status of linezolid, concerns about serious adverse effects prompted the 2016 WHO update to caution that where close monitoring for adverse events is unavailable, "linezolid would best be reserved for MDR‐TB patients who have additional drug resistance.or who are intolerant to other components of the core regimen" (WHO 2016a). The 2018 WHO rapid communication, which recommends linezolid for all people with MDR‐TB unless it cannot be used, still states that, "Optimal duration of use of Lzd [linezolid] is not established. Use for at least 6 months was shown to be highly effective, although toxicity may limit its use" (WHO 2018).

Five meta‐analyses have examined the evidence for linezolid in drug‐resistant tuberculosis (Cox 2012; Sotgiu 2012; Chang 2013c; Zhang 2015; Ahmad 2018). They include mostly observational data, much of it retrospective. Few randomized studies have been undertaken. There remains much debate surrounding linezolid, due to the lack of high‐quality evidence. Many suggest it should be more widely used, hence its upgrade in the recent WHO guidance (Caminero 2015; Ahmad 2018; WHO 2018).

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 9 lists the most common selected adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of ABSSSI patients receiving ZEVTERA in TRIAL 2.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia

ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 study in adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).

In TRIAL 3, 310 patients received ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) every 8 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion, and 322 patients were treated with ceftriaxone 2 grams as a 0.5 hour IV infusion with or without linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours as a 60-minute IV infusion. The dose of ZEVTERA was adjusted based on renal function.

The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 56 years, ranging from 18–90 with approximately 36% aged greater or equal to 65 years. Approximately 62% of patients were White, 45% were from outside Europe or the United States, and 57% were male. Patients across treatment arms received treatment for a median duration of 9 days.

Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Adult Patients

In TRIAL 3, a total of 35/310 (11.3%) patients with CABP treated with ZEVTERA and 37/322 (11.5%) patients with CABP treated with ceftriaxone ± linezolid experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 18/310 (5.8%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 12/322 (3.7%) of patients treated with ceftriaxone ± linezolid. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in patients treated with ZEVTERA was vomiting, occurring in 4/310 (1.3%). Deaths occurred in 9/310 (2.9%) patients treated with ZEVTERA and 9/322 (2.8%) in patients treated with ceftriaxone ± linezolid.

### Randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin versus IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin for treatment of patients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization [^113QJgtw]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires the use of antibiotics with activity against a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens and suitable pharmacokinetic properties to simplify IV-to-oral step-down therapy switches.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin with a standard regimen of IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin in patients with mild to moderate CAP requiring hospitalization.

Methods

In a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study, adults with CAP received 7 to 14 days of treatment with either IV gatifloxacin 400 mg QD with the stepdown option or IV ceftriaxone 1 or 2 g QD (with or without erythromycin 0.5 or 1 g QID or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) with the stepdown option.

Results

One hundred seventy adults with CAP were included in the study. IV gatifloxacin was stepped down to oral gatifloxacin in 90.6% (7785) of patients; IV ceftriaxone was stepped down to oral clarithromycin in 87.1% (7485) of patients. Among clinically evaluable patients (n = 153), cure rates at 1 to 3 days after treatment were 97.4% in the gatifloxacin group (7476) and 90.9% in the ceftriaxone group (7077), with a 95% CI for the difference (-3.7% to 19.1%) indicating statistical equivalence. In patients in whom pathogens were isolated from pretreatment sputum cultures, bacteriologic eradication rates were 100.0% (2929) and 90.9% (3033), respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated; treatment-related adverse events occurred in 27.1% (2385) and 21.2% (1885) of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

In the population studied, treatment with IV gatifloxacin with an option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin was as effective for achieving clinical cure as IV ceftriaxone (with or without concomitant IV erythromycin or clarithromycin) with an option for oral stepdown clarithromycin. Both regimens were well tolerated.

### Safety of newer parenteral antibiotics [^111cM1Zz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Several parenteral antimicrobials have been introduced into clinical practice over the course of the last decade. Some of these agents (e.g., linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline) are prototypes of new classes of compounds. In comparative clinical trials, these newer anti-infectives have been shown to be safe and to have low rates of discontinuation by patients. However, long-term use has revealed unique toxicities associated with the use of some of these drugs. The adverse events and potential drug interactions associated with the use of these antibiotics are variable and require familiarity with the safety profile of each drug. It is especially important that clinicians be able to recognize serious adverse events associated with the use of specific drugs, because most of the adverse events can be readily reversed by cessation of therapy.

### Lefamulin efficacy and safety in a pooled phase 3 clinical trial population with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and common clinical comorbidities [^117T96ak]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lefamulin, a first-in-class pleuromutilin antibiotic approved for intravenous and oral use in adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), was noninferior to moxifloxacin in the Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia (LEAP) 1 intravenous-to-oral switch study and the LEAP 2 oral-only study. Using pooled LEAP 1/2 data, we examined lefamulin efficacy/safety overall and within subgroups of patients presenting with comorbidities typical in CABP management.

Methods

In LEAP 1, adults with CABP were randomized to receive intravenous lefamulin (150 mg every 12 h) for 5‒7 days or moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 h) for 7 days, with optional intravenous-to-oral switch if predefined improvement criteria were met. In LEAP 2, adults with CABP were randomized to receive oral lefamulin (600 mg every 12 h) for 5 days or moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 h) for 7 days. Both studies assessed early clinical response (ECR) at 96 ± 24 h after first study drug dose and investigator assessment of clinical response (IACR) at test-of-cure (5‒10 days after last dose). Pooled analyses of the overall population used a 10% noninferiority margin.

Results

Lefamulin (n = 646) was noninferior to moxifloxacin (n = 643) for ECR (89.3% vs 90.5%, respectively; difference − 1.1%; 95% CI − 4.4 to 2.2); IACR success rates at test-of-cure were similarly high (≥ 85.0%). High efficacy with both lefamulin and moxifloxacin was also demonstrated across all well-represented patient subgroups, including those with advanced age, diabetes mellitus, a history of cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia) or chronic lung diseases (e.g. asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), elevated liver enzymes, or mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

Lefamulin may provide a valuable intravenous/oral monotherapy alternative to fluoroquinolones or macrolides for empiric treatment of patients with CABP, including cases of patients at risk for poor outcomes due to age or various comorbidities.

Rethinking the role of MIC in dosing decisions

MIC variability complicates dose optimization, as values fluctuate with pathogen traits, resistance, and testing methods. Though an MIC of 2 mg/L is often used empirically, it does not always reflect in vivo drug activity or patient-specific factors, limiting its reliability.

A broader approach integrating infection severity, drug exposure, and PK/PD profiles is essential.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^111RLhV5].

PICO question IX — safety of prolonged infusion (PI) versus short infusion (SI) β‑lactams: We cannot recommend for or against the use of PI over SI to provide a safety advantage and reduce adverse effects of β‑lactam antibiotics. (Conditional recommendation; very low certainty of evidence). Currently, no clinical trials have demonstrated a safety advantage for PI β‑lactam antibiotics when compared to administration via SI, and across adverse events reported within 18 RCTs and 8 observational studies — including acute kidney injury, diarrhea (including Clostridioides difficile infection), phlebitis or infusion‑related infections, and transaminitis — there was no apparent difference when administration time is prolonged.

### Hypoglycemia in patients treated with linezolid [^116EJeNS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia was not previously known to be a linezolid-associated adverse reaction. A case report describing symptomatic hypoglycemia in a linezolid recipient prompted a review of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, which demonstrated a relationship between linezolid and hypoglycemia. A warning with this information was added to the linezolid package insert.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for MDR/XDR-TB — indications and application note that many MDR-TB experts use TDM to identify absorption problems and inform dose adjustments; individuals with poor response despite adherence may benefit from TDM. Patients with gastrointestinal problems that increase risk of malabsorption, concurrent HIV infection, impaired renal clearance, or diabetes should be prioritized for TDM, and some experts use TDM for all patients being treated for MDR or XDR-TB early in treatment rather than waiting for a poor response. TDM should be used and interpreted in consultation with an expert in MDR-TB. TDM may help limit toxicity due to certain drugs, including the injectable drugs cycloserine and linezolid, and linezolid toxicity is associated with elevated trough values. Fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent efficacy, and higher doses of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin are being studied.

### Linezolid [^113GDF54]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Changes seen in other laboratory parameters, without regard to drug relationship, revealed no substantial differences between linezolid and the comparators. These changes were generally not clinically significant, did not lead to discontinuation of therapy, and were reversible. The incidence of adult and pediatric patients with at least one substantially abnormal hematologic or serum chemistry value is presented in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7.
