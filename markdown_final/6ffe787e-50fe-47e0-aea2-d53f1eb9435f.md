## Question

Soft tissue sarcoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about soft tissue sarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial suspicion and referral triggers. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, including imaging, biopsy, and expert pathology. Next, I will stage and risk-stratify and confirm prognostic factors. After that, I need to check multidisciplinary planning, surgical principles, and radiotherapy indications and sequencing. Finally, I will review systemic therapy by disease setting, special scenarios such as retroperitoneal disease and unplanned excisions, genetics and precision oncology, and surveillance strategies, ensuring each step aligns with high-credibility guidelines and data.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that mandate referral to a sarcoma center before any invasive procedure, because unplanned excisions worsen outcomes; deep location beneath the fascia or size ≥ 5 cm should trigger immediate referral, and I should double-check that both ESMO-aligned summaries and population data support this threshold and the consequences of non-expert management, which they do, with high rates of unplanned surgery and low biopsy conformity outside expert centers [^113LSAfL] [^113sWfQs] [^115NyB9A].

> Next, I should review the initial imaging strategy; ultrasound can triage small superficial masses, but I need to ensure MRI is obtained for suspected sarcoma to define extent, neurovascular relationships, and to guide the biopsy tract, and I will verify that current ESSR guidance identifies MRI as the modality of choice for characterization and local staging, which it does unequivocally [^112YjSp8] [^1123c6Xu].

> Wait, let me verify staging imaging for metastases; chest CT is standard for pulmonary metastasis assessment in intermediate or high-grade tumors, and post-neoadjuvant imaging is pivotal for planning; ESSR consensus emphasizes immediate post-neoadjuvant imaging and structured surveillance protocols using MRI locally and CT chest systemically, which I should integrate into planning [^116Tpi1L] [^1123c6Xu].

> I will now examine biopsy principles; core needle biopsy performed along a future resection tract by the sarcoma center is preferred to minimize contamination and to enable definitive planning, and pathology must be reviewed by an expert using WHO 2020 criteria with grading and histology-specific molecular tests, which I should confirm aligns with ESMO recommendations, and it does; hold on, I should not overstate this as "never open biopsy", because while open/incisional biopsy is discouraged in non-expert settings, it remains appropriate at sarcoma centers when cores are non-diagnostic, so I will correct that nuance here [^115ZtwS1] [^112YjSp8].

> Let me consider germline predisposition; I need to ensure I identify patients warranting genetic counseling and testing pre-treatment, especially those younger than 46 or with family histories suggestive of TP53-related cancer syndromes or prior radiation fields, and recent guidance supports offering germline TP53 testing under these conditions and even considering broader testing in AYAs, so I should document this indication explicitly [^116CZLY8].

> Next, I should review staging and risk stratification; AJCC 8th edition is the framework, but I must confirm prognostic factors that drive local and systemic therapy such as size, grade, depth, margins, age, rupture/contamination, and nodal or distant disease, with multistate analyses and guideline surgical reporting elements reinforcing their independent significance, which supports tailoring intensity of local and systemic treatment [^1123c6Xu] [^112TNNpZ] [^114Rzie4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management before confirming multidisciplinary review; every case should be discussed in a sarcoma MDT to set intent, sequence modalities, assess resectability, and consider trials, and ASTRO explicitly anchors local therapy decisions in MDT evaluation, so I need to ensure this step precedes definitive therapy [^114GbS5f].

> I will now verify surgical principles for localized disease; the standard is en bloc wide excision aiming for R0 margins by a sarcoma-trained surgeon, avoiding marginal or debulking procedures, as ESMO states; I should confirm that this applies across adult-type STS in localized settings, which it does, and that surgical reports document contamination, rupture, and planned margin quality to inform adjuvant decisions [^1123PyeQ] [^114Rzie4].

> Next, I should determine indications for radiotherapy; patients at increased local recurrence risk, including high-grade, deep, or > 5 cm tumors or when close/positive margins are anticipated, should receive RT, with ASTRO recommending preoperative RT over postoperative RT when RT is indicated; I need to double-check that low-risk patients planned for oncologic resection should not receive neoadjuvant RT, which ASTRO also clarifies [^114GbS5f] [^117RC5hB].

> Let me think about sequencing and dose; preoperative RT is typically 50 Gy in 25 fractions, which reduces target volume and late toxicity, whereas postoperative RT uses 50–50.4 Gy to CTV1 with a 10–16 Gy boost to CTV2 depending on margin status; wait, I should verify the margin-contingent boost recommendation and ensure it is framed for postoperative courses and as a boost after preoperative RT only when indicated, which ASTRO specifies accurately [^1141fq51] [^1166EU9K] [^114GbS5f].

> I need to ensure technical planning details are correct; ASTRO advises anatomically constrained CTVs for preoperative RT, volumetric contouring with OAR constraints for either pre- or postoperative RT, and explicitly recommends against elective nodal irradiation for extremity/truncal STS, so target volumes and normal tissue protection should follow these standards [^112BdhKi] [^112DPWBi] [^117SavFM].

> But wait, retroperitoneal sarcoma is an exception; routine addition of RT to oncologic resection is conditionally not recommended, and ESMO clarifies that surgery en bloc with adherent organs is standard while intraoperative or postoperative RT is not recommended and systemic therapy evidence is limited, so I must not overgeneralize extremity rules to RPS [^114GbS5f] [^117NBY9o] [^117FAMdq].

> Hmm, unplanned excisions deserve a specific pathway; after an "oops" resection, oncologic reresection is recommended when feasible and ASTRO favors preoperative RT before reresection when RT is indicated, though postoperative RT is an option if reresection is not feasible; I should acknowledge that retrospective series suggest good local control with preop RT followed by definitive surgery, while also noting wound risk trade-offs that must be discussed and individualized [^111eGHMi] [^113FkKBu] [^112ipt4i].

> I should now consider when surgery alone may suffice; for low-grade, small, superficial, adequately excised lesions with clear margins, omission of RT can be reasonable, but I need to verify that high-grade or larger deep tumors usually benefit from combined modality therapy, as ESMO and ASTRO convey, and I should document margin status carefully to guide adjuvant decisions [^111PfcjU] [^114GbS5f].

> Let me review perioperative chemotherapy for localized high-risk disease; evidence is mixed, so ESMO advises considering neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, including ifosfamide-based regimens and regional hyperthermia in very high-risk settings after shared decision-making, and isolated limb perfusion can be limb-sparing in select extremity cases; I should double-check that practice varies and emphasize individualized MDT decisions here, which is consistent with expert surveys [^112UbhCj] [^115P6ht1] [^1144RWpb].

> Next, I should verify systemic therapy standards in advanced disease; anthracycline-based therapy remains first line, with consideration of multi-agent regimens such as ifosfamide- or dacarbazine-containing combinations when response is advantageous and the patient is fit, which ESMO endorses and I should document clearly for shared decision-making [^116Ms2Wg].

> I need to check subsequent-line options; ESMO recommends pazopanib for non-adipocytic STS, trabectedin for certain histologies, eribulin for liposarcoma, and gemcitabine-based combinations after doxorubicin, so histology and prior therapy should guide sequencing, and I should ensure tolerability and comorbidity reviews precede selection [^113pcbU5] [^112UCoBV] [^112tDxeL] [^1164Bt86].

> Hold on, I should not forget precision oncology; for NTRK-rearranged sarcomas, TRK inhibitors are standard in advanced settings, with potential preoperative use to improve function and resectability, and broader genomic profiling can refine diagnosis and reveal actionability in a meaningful minority, so I should confirm testing logistics early in the pathway [^112F6yeT] [^112KkUXB].

> I will now examine special histologies briefly to avoid misapplication of generic STS rules; desmoid-type fibromatosis prioritizes active surveillance and individualized local/systemic options rather than routine surgery or RT, and uterine sarcomas have site-specific standards such as en bloc hysterectomy without adjuvant RT, so I must verify histology at MDT to trigger the correct pathway [^111gc2Ht] [^114KLyBA].

> Next, I should review surveillance; after completion of initial therapy, surveillance should be individualized by grade and subtype, using MRI for local sites and chest CT for lung metastases at defined intervals, and ESSR emphasizes that imaging immediately after neoadjuvant therapy informs resection planning, which I should integrate into the postoperative follow-up strategy [^1123c6Xu] [^116Tpi1L].

> Finally, I should double-check that all steps emphasize centralization, documentation, and shared decision-making; care in expert centers improves conformity to guidelines and outcomes, reports should detail margins and contamination, and patients should be counseled on the benefits and risks of each modality, with MDT-driven sequencing to optimize local control, limb function, and survival [^115NyB9A] [^114Rzie4] [^114GbS5f].

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are **rare, heterogeneous mesenchymal malignancies** best managed in specialized centers with a multidisciplinary team [^115JDFhK]. The cornerstone of care is **wide surgical excision with negative margins** [^1123PyeQ] for localized disease, with **preoperative radiotherapy preferred** [^114GbS5f] for high-grade or large tumors to improve local control and preserve function. Systemic therapy is guided by histology and risk: **anthracycline-based regimens** [^116Ms2Wg] for high-risk or advanced disease, with ifosfamide [^113pcbU5], trabectedin [^112UCoBV], pazopanib [^113pcbU5], or eribulin [^112tDxeL] for specific subtypes or lines of therapy. Prognosis depends on grade, size, and margins [^112TNNpZ], with 5-year survival of 70–90% for low-grade and 50–60% for high-grade tumors; regular MRI and chest CT surveillance is essential for early detection of recurrence or metastasis [^1123c6Xu].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Soft tissue sarcomas are **rare**, accounting for **approximately 1% of adult malignancies** [^112YjSp8], with an incidence of 4–8 per 100,000 per year in Europe [^111aUEap]. Risk is increased with prior radiation exposure, genetic cancer syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni [^116CZLY8], and chronic lymphedema.

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with a **painless, enlarging mass** in the extremities, trunk, or retroperitoneum. Red flags include a size greater than **5 cm** [^113LSAfL], a **deep location**, **rapid growth**, or **recurrence** after excision.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging

MRI is the **modality of choice** [^112YjSp8] for local staging and surgical planning. CT is used for chest staging and for retroperitoneal tumors, and PET-CT may be considered in high-grade or metastatic disease [^1123c6Xu].

---

### Biopsy

Core needle biopsy is **preferred** for histologic diagnosis and grading [^115ZtwS1]. Excisional biopsy is avoided because of the risk of contamination and recurrence [^1178Ysxu].

---

### Histopathology and grading

More than **80 histologic subtypes** are recognized [^112KkUXB], including liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Grading uses the **FNCLCC system** [^115ZtwS1] (grades 1–3) based on differentiation, mitotic count, and necrosis.

---

## Treatment strategies

### Localized disease

#### Surgery

The standard treatment is **wide excision with negative margins (R0)** [^1123PyeQ]. Limb-sparing surgery is preferred over amputation when feasible [^112s73vT].

---

#### Radiotherapy

Radiotherapy is indicated for high-grade, large (> 5 cm), or deep tumors; **preoperative radiotherapy is preferred** [^112QrGnq] as it allows smaller fields and better functional outcomes. Postoperative radiotherapy is used when margins are positive or close [^114hGPHT].

---

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is considered for **high-risk tumors** (large, high-grade, deep) or for chemosensitive subtypes such as synovial sarcoma [^116Ms2Wg]. Regimens commonly use doxorubicin with or without ifosfamide [^112UbhCj].

---

### Advanced or metastatic disease

#### Systemic therapy

- **First-line**: Anthracyclines (doxorubicin) [^116Ms2Wg].
- **Second-line**: Ifosfamide [^116Ms2Wg], trabectedin [^112UCoBV], pazopanib [^113pcbU5], eribulin (liposarcoma) [^112tDxeL].
- **Immunotherapy**: Limited efficacy; ongoing trials [^113CUQrM].

---

#### Surgical metastasectomy

Surgical resection is considered for patients with **resectable lung metastases** and a good performance status [^116FEkNU].

---

## Prognostic factors

- **Histologic grade**: Most important predictor of recurrence and survival [^112TNNpZ].
- **Tumor size**: Larger tumors have worse prognosis [^114x51eU].
- **Margins**: Positive margins increase recurrence risk.
- **Histologic subtype**: Influences response to therapy and outcomes [^112KkUXB].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Surveillance relies on **regular MRI and chest CT** to detect local recurrence or distant metastasis [^1123c6Xu]. Typical intervals are every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then annually thereafter.

---

## Emerging therapies and research

- **Targeted therapies**: NTRK inhibitors for NTRK-rearranged sarcomas [^112F6yeT].
- **Immunotherapy**: Ongoing trials with checkpoint inhibitors [^111TYQwj].
- **Genomic profiling**: Identifies actionable mutations and guides therapy [^112KkUXB].

---

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous tumors requiring multidisciplinary management. Surgery with negative margins is the **cornerstone of treatment**, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy used selectively based on tumor characteristics. Prognosis depends on grade, size, and margins, and regular surveillance is essential for early detection of recurrence.

European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

The updated guidelines for imaging of soft tissue tumors by the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) aim to provide best practice expert consensus recommendations for standardized imaging algorithms, techniques, and reporting in soft tissue tumors of adults.

Since the first consensus in 2015, technical advancements, further insights into specific entities, the revised WHO classification (2020), and a new version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (2017) necessitated the update. A Delphi process, based on evidence from the literature where possible, enables consensus on complex problems among a panel of experts. This process has been employed in several ESSR guidelines recently, including primary local imaging of soft tissue tumors, whole body staging in sarcoma, and non-malignant entities requiring special algorithms.

This part of the recommendations is intended to support radiologists who assess the effects of treatment and perform imaging for surveillance of soft tissue tumors. Choosing adequate treatment for soft tissue tumors is complicated by the rarity of sarcomas, which consist of numerous histological types and subtypes. This diversity leads to significantly different behavior and prognosis, influenced by the location, depth, size, and grade of the tumor. Response assessment is critical in tumors undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, as it provides a basis for planning subsequent treatment. Once the initial treatment is completed, an individualized surveillance strategy must be chosen.

### Radiation therapy for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults: Executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^114GbS5f]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2021). High credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the indications for radiation therapy (RT), sequencing of local therapies, and appropriate dose and planning techniques for the management of primary, operable, localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in adults.

The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address five key questions focused on the use of RT for management of STS. These questions included indications for RT for STS of the extremity and superficial trunk; considerations for sequencing of RT concerning surgery, RT dose, appropriate treatment volumes and techniques; and the role of RT in the management of retroperitoneal sarcoma. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.

Multidisciplinary evaluation and decision making are recommended for all cases of STS. RT is recommended for patients in whom there is an increased risk of local recurrence of resected STS, particularly if close or microscopically positive margins are anticipated or have occurred. When RT is indicated, preoperative RT is strongly recommended over postoperative RT. Postoperative RT is conditionally recommended in specific clinical circumstances (e.g. uncontrolled pain or bleeding) or when the risk of wound complications outweighs the risk of late toxicity from RT. Routine use of RT in addition to oncologic resection for retroperitoneal sarcoma is conditionally not recommended.

### Soft tissue and visceral sarcomas: ESMO-EURACAN-GENTURIS clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^111gc2Ht]. Annals of Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for soft tissue sarcoma, and more specifically with respect to patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis, the ERN GENTURIS/ESMO/EURACAN 2021 guidelines recommend offering the continuation of active surveillance, systemic therapies, and local therapies. These include percutaneous cryoablation, isolated limb perfusion (if the lesion is confined to an extremity), surgery in favorable locations, or radiotherapy. Each treatment option should be considered individually on a multidisciplinary basis in patients with progressing desmoid-type fibromatosis.

### Management of soft tissue sarcomas in extremities: Variation in treatment recommendations and surveillance according to specialty and continent [^113sWfQs]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with a mesenchymal origin. This group of malignant tumors has more than 80 histologic subtypes and accounts for 1% of all adult malignancies. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, with an estimated incidence of about 5 patients per 100,000 persons in Europe every year. All this together makes it challenging to generate high-level evidence for the management of primary STS.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline (NCCN) and the European Society of Medical Oncology guideline (ESMO) are two broadly used international clinical practice guidelines for the management and surveillance of STS. The two guidelines are similar and agree that surgery is the cornerstone for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (eSTS). Perioperative radiotherapy (RTX) is recommended to improve local control in settings wherein adequate margins are not possible or for high-grade, deep-seated tumors, or tumors 5 cm in size or larger. Perioperative chemotherapy (CTX) is not standard practice, but it can be offered as an option to high-risk patients after shared decision-making.

Although several studies have shown that adherence to guidelines results in better patient outcomes, 32–70% of patients with STS are not consistently treated in accordance with the clinical guidelines. This study aimed to acquire insight into the variation of eSTS management by assessing the influence of clinical specialty and continent on clinical practice and surveillance.

### The management of soft tissue sarcoma [^113sadSR]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are a rare group of mesenchymal tumors that display cardinal signs, which can raise suspicion for their diagnosis. Management in a sarcoma treatment center by its multidisciplinary team has improved outcomes. Good local disease control with limb salvage and adjuvant radiotherapy has considerably reduced the morbidity of previous limb amputation. By the early involvement of a plastic surgeon, tissue reconstruction is optimized and wound complications are reduced. This article examines the contemporary management of soft tissue sarcoma and, in particular, its relevance to the plastic surgeon today.

### Simple guidelines for efficient referral of soft-tissue sarcomas: A population-based evaluation of adherence to guidelines and referral patterns [^113LSAfL]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma requires multidisciplinary management at a sarcoma center. However, these rare tumors are often misinterpreted as benign, and many are inadequately treated outside a sarcoma center, with an increased risk of local recurrence that often requires further extensive surgical treatment. To improve referral and centralization of soft-tissue sarcoma management in the southern Sweden health care region, an open-access outpatient clinic at our sarcoma center and simple referral guidelines have been established for the past thirty years. The guidelines call for referral of all deep-seated soft-tissue tumors and all ≥ 5-cm superficial tumors before open biopsy or surgery. We evaluated adherence to these guidelines and characterized referral patterns. We also studied the consequences of our strategy with regard to the relative numbers of benign and malignant diagnoses among referred patients.

- **Methods**: Adherence to guidelines, referral pathways, and time to referral to the sarcoma center were analyzed in a population-based series of 100 consecutive patients with soft-tissue sarcoma in the extremities or trunk wall. We also analyzed diagnosis and management of benign and malignant tumors in a second cohort consisting of 464 consecutive patients referred to the sarcoma center because of a soft-tissue tumor.

- **Results**: Ninety-seven of the 100 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma were referred to the sarcoma center. All fifty-eight of the deep-seated soft-tissue sarcomas and twenty-eight of the forty-two superficial tumors were referred.

### Cutaneous sarcoma: A review and practical approach to management [^114qW7kC]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Sarcomas arising in the skin are rare but potentially fatal. These tumors originate from mesenchymal cells and can be divided between those that arise in soft tissue and those arising from bone. General guidelines exist for the management of soft-tissue sarcomas; however, there are no specific guidelines for cutaneous sarcomas. Literature was reviewed for management of seven cutaneous sarcomas, including atypical fibroxanthoma, pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, dermal and subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibroma sarcoma protuberans, Kaposi sarcoma, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

All suspected sarcomas should be discussed in a sarcoma multidisciplinary team meeting. This article is not a clinical guideline but should serve as a practical summary of how these tumors present, how they are recognized histologically, and how best to manage and follow-up patients. The aim is to support clinicians and facilitate the best and most evidence-based standard of care available.

### Management of soft tissue sarcomas in extremities: Variation in treatment recommendations and surveillance according to specialty and continent [^11632hWp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The survey was received by 1,386 potential respondents and completed by 428 respondents, resulting in a response rate of 30.9%. Of these, 396 met the inclusion criteria. The study excluded respondents without a special interest in STS (n = 31) and those who were not physicians (n = 1). The last question of the survey was answered by 255 respondents (64.4%). Appendix 2 presents a flowchart of the respondent inclusion.

The baseline characteristics of the respondents are depicted in Table 1. Most of the respondents were orthopedic oncologists (43.2%, n = 171), practiced in Europe (44.9%, n = 155), and had more than 15 years of experience after their fellowship (36.9%, n = 146).

### Soft tissue and visceral sarcomas: ESMO-EURACAN-GENTURIS clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116FEkNU]. Annals of Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The ERN GENTURIS/ESMO/EURACAN 2021 guidelines recommend surgery as the standard treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcoma, specifically concerning the resection of lung metastases. Surgery is advised for metachronous, resectable lung metastases, where the disease-free interval is one year and there is no extrapulmonary disease, provided that complete excision of all lesions is feasible.

### Can multistate modeling of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and death improve the prediction of outcome in patients with soft tissue sarcomas [^112TNNpZ]. Clinical orthopaedics and related research (2017). Low credibility.

Exploration of the complex relationship between prognostic indicators such as tumor grade and size and clinical outcomes such as local recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with cancer is crucial to guide treatment decisions. However, in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, there are many gaps in our understanding of this relationship. Multistate analysis may help us in gaining a comprehensive understanding of risk factor-outcome relationships in soft tissue sarcoma because this methodology can integrate multiple risk factors and clinical endpoints into a single statistical model. To our knowledge, no study of this kind has been performed before in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

- **Questions/purposes**: We implemented a multistate model of localized soft tissue sarcoma to statistically evaluate the relationship among baseline risk factors, recurrence, and death in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma undergoing curative surgery.

- **Methods**: Between 1998 and 2015, our center treated 539 patients for localized soft tissue sarcoma with surgery as curative intent. Of those, 96 patients (18%) were not included in this single-center retrospective study owing to missing baseline histopathology data (n = 3), not yet observed follow-up (n = 80), or because a neoadjuvant treatment approach in the presence of synchronous distant metastasis was used (n = 13), leaving 443 patients (82%) for the analysis, of which 40 were lost to follow-up during the first year after surgery. All patients had tumors of the stages I to III according to the American Joint Committee.

### Genetic predisposition in sarcomas: Clinical implications and management [^116CZLY8]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Germline genetic testing prior to sarcoma management is crucial for selected patients who develop soft tissue sarcoma (STS) or osteosarcoma before the age of 46 years. The ESMO-EURACAN-GENTURIS (European Society for Medical Oncology; European Reference Network for Rare Adult Solid Cancers; European Reference Network for Genetic Tumour Risk Syndromes) clinical practice guidelines for STS and bone sarcoma recommend offering germline TP53 testing, ideally before treatment initiation. Testing is advised for STS and osteosarcoma patients with at least one first or second-degree relative who had a TP53-related tumor before age 56, or for those with STS (especially in a previously irradiated area) or osteosarcoma and a history of another TP53-associated tumor diagnosed before age 46.

TP53 pathogenic variants occur in up to 5% of osteosarcoma patients and often arise de novo. It has been proposed that TP53 genetic testing could be indicated for all osteosarcoma patients, regardless of family history. Furthermore, the counselling and testing of all children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma have been suggested.

As our understanding of established syndromes improves and new syndromes emerge, identifying patients at risk, and determining who may benefit from screening becomes increasingly complex. This complexity underscores the need to redefine which cases should be offered genetic counselling, including considering whether all sarcoma patients should receive it.

### Challenges in the management of complex soft-tissue sarcoma clinical scenarios [^112shKWe]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Low credibility.

With nearly 15,000 new cases of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) in the United States each year, early diagnosis and therapeutic management is imperative for successful patient outcomes. Primary STS is conventionally treated with a combination of wide-margin resection, neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy, and, in specific cases, adjuvant chemotherapy. However, in situations of complex disease presentation, guidelines for treatment are less clearly outlined. Limited metastatic disease, local recurrence, fungating STSs, and unplanned or incomplete resections of STSs present unique challenges for the multidisciplinary care team. The management of complex STS clinical scenarios usually involves limb-salvage resection or amputation, as well as some combination of radiation therapy and/or ablative interventional radiology techniques. As a result, a multidisciplinary team approach is essential for treating patients in these challenging scenarios, with a recent focus on the integration of plastic and reconstructive surgery into the treatment algorithm.

### Clinical genomic profiling in the management of patients with soft tissue and bone sarcoma [^112KkUXB]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are more than 70 distinct sarcomas, and this diversity complicates the development of precision-based therapeutics for these cancers. Prospective comprehensive genomic profiling could overcome this challenge by providing insight into sarcomas' molecular drivers. Through targeted panel sequencing of 7,494 sarcomas representing 44 histologies, we identify highly type-specific alterations that aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Sequencing could lead to the refinement or reassignment of 10.5% of diagnoses. Nearly one-third of patients (31.7%) harbor potentially actionable alterations, including a significant proportion (2.6%) with kinase gene rearrangements; 3.9% have a tumor mutational burden ≥ 10 mut/Mb.

We describe low frequencies of microsatellite instability (< 0.3%) and a high degree of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (15%) across sarcomas, which are not readily explained by homologous recombination deficiency (observed in 2.5% of cases). In a clinically annotated subset of 118 patients, we validate actionable genetic events as therapeutic targets. Collectively, our findings reveal the genetic landscape of human sarcomas, which may inform the future development of therapeutics and improve clinical outcomes for patients with these rare cancers.

### Has the Affordable Care Act been associated with increased insurance coverage and early-stage diagnoses of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas in adults [^112f3Cnb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). High credibility.

Treatment of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas can be costly, and it is not surprising that the insurance status of patients is a prognostic factor in determining overall survival. Uninsured individuals with suspected bone and/or soft-tissue masses often encounter difficulty accessing basic healthcare, such as office visits and radiology scans. Consequently, they are more likely to be diagnosed at later stages.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate of 2010 aimed to increase access to care for uninsured individuals by launching initiatives like expanding Medicaid eligibility, subsidizing private insurance, and developing statewide mandates requiring individuals to have a prescribed minimum level of health insurance. Although prior reports have demonstrated that the ACA increased both coverage and the proportion of early-stage diagnoses among patients with common cancers, such as breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer, it is unknown whether similar improvements have occurred for patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Understanding changes in insurance coverages and stage at diagnosis of patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas is crucial to establishing policies that ensure orthopaedic cancer care is equitable and accessible to all.

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) Has the introduction of the ACA been associated with changes in insurance coverage for adult patients with newly diagnosed bone and soft-tissue sarcomas? (2) Did the introduction of health reforms under the ACA lead…

### Radiation therapy before repeat wide resection for unplanned surgery of soft tissue sarcoma ("Oops" operation) results in improved disease-free survival [^1163cK5r]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The initial management of superficial tumors across the body is often performed by primary physicians or general surgeons. A situation where a mass presumed to be benign is resected and the pathology comes back as sarcoma is often referred to as an "oops" operation. The reported rate of unplanned resection of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is high: 18% to 50%. In our tertiary hospital, 65 out of 488 operations (13%) performed for STS in the past 7 years were initially diagnosed as benign tumors after an unplanned resection.

Rehders et al. showed that the results of "oops operations" are inferior to those of planned surgery for STS. Radiation therapy was reported to significantly improve local control in stage 3 STS in the extremities. Neo-adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to result in better functional outcomes with similar local control and noncompromising overall survival. Haas et al. emphasized the value of RT in the treatment of patients with STS.

According to the predictive nomogram for treatment of STS, a small, superficial sarcoma, resected with adequate margins, does not need further RT owing to the good results of surgery alone. Smolle et al. showed that RT significantly improves the results of treatment if sarcoma is revealed after the unplanned surgery. The authors stated, however, that RT should be recommended in the adjuvant rather than the neo-adjuvant setting, considering the high risk of wound complications. The question of timing of RT before or after the re-resection is still unresolved. It is also unknown whether the tumor or tumor bed remaining after the first surgery, soiled by inappropriately managed resection, contributes to adverse outcomes.

### Survival after induction chemotherapy and surgical resection for high-grade soft tissue sarcoma: Is radiation necessary [^1176iooD]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Induction chemotherapy can produce dramatic necrosis in sarcomas, raising the question of whether or not radiation is necessary. This study reviews the clinical outcome of a subset of patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS) who were treated with induction chemotherapy and surgical resection but without radiation.

- **Methods**: Nonmetastatic, large, high-grade STS of the pelvis and extremities were treated with intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, and, after 1995, ifosfamide. After induction, oncologic resection and histologic evaluation were performed. Good responders with good surgical margins were not treated with radiation.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients, with a median follow-up of 5 years, were included. The limb salvage rate was 94%. Median tumor necrosis was 95%. Four patients developed metastatic disease, with three subsequent deaths. Two local recurrences occurred; both patients were salvaged with reresection and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy, although one died of metastatic disease 10 years later. Relapse-free and overall survival is 80% and 88% at 5 and 10 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Intensive induction chemotherapy can be extremely effective for high-grade STS, permitting limb-sparing surgery in lieu of amputation. Radiation may not be necessary if a good response to induction chemotherapy and negative wide margins are achieved. All patients with large, deep, high-grade STS of the extremities should be considered candidates for induction chemotherapy.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: What is standard, what is new [^113u16W4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms with mesenchymal origin, encompassing approximately 70 different entities. The natural history of these aggressive diseases is characterized by a strong tendency toward local recurrence and metastatic spreading, which occur in 10–30% and 30–40% of patients, respectively, despite optimal initial strategies. The lung is the most common site of STS metastases, and pulmonary metastasectomy is the standard treatment for selected patients with limited lung disease. For metastatic patients not eligible for surgery, chemotherapy still plays the most relevant role in the management of the disease. Despite advances over the last decades, the outcome for metastatic patients remains poor, with a median reported overall survival (OS) of 14–17 months. In this review, we aim to summarize the results from the most recent studies on metastatic STS and provide indications on the treatment of this rare condition.

### Current approach to pediatric soft tissue sarcomas [^111psjUL]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

The development of a new soft tissue lesion in an otherwise healthy child, adolescent, or young adult can present many challenges for pediatric or medical oncology teams. Although uncommon, the diagnosis of a soft tissue malignancy should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent pain, even if no mass is palpable. The definitive diagnosis and treatment of a soft tissue mass is aided by timely scans, appropriate biopsy for anatomic and molecular pathology, and a treatment approach guided by the specific diagnosis. Because pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are rare, cooperative groups play a crucial role in defining the standard of care through retrospective series and well-designed prospective clinical trials. Enrollment of newly diagnosed patients in clinical studies should be encouraged to continue to improve outcomes and understanding of these rare tumors.

This review focuses on the recommendations for management of sarcomas that typically occur in the soft tissues of pediatric and young adult patients.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: What is standard, what is new [^112Y46Ym]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Doxorubicin remains, at the time of writing, the standard in the treatment of advanced STS. The combination with ifosfamide should be considered upfront in fit patients who might benefit from tumor response and in histologies with selective sensitivity to alkylating agents. Despite encouraging preliminary data, results from the recently completed phase 3 study on olaratumab and doxorubicin are required to confirm the value of this combination in first-line treatment. Beyond the first line, the treatment for STS is being increasingly driven by histology. Newer strategies, including drugs targeting epigenetic mechanisms and immunotherapies, are currently being developed to improve the outcome in this population.

### Influence of physician specialty on treatment recommendations in the multidisciplinary management of soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities [^115kNzgg]. JAMA Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Although prospective randomized data are available to guide the multidisciplinary management of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremities, controversy exists regarding adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

- **Objective**: To determine if clinical specialty introduces bias in recommendations for multimodality treatment of STS.

- **Design**: Electronic survey.

- **Setting**: Database of active members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Society of Surgical Oncology, and the Connective Tissue Oncology Society.

- **Participants**: Members of specialty oncology societies with an active interest in STS.

- **Exposure**: Physician specialty.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Survey responses regarding the multidisciplinary management of STS were scored on a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed using analysis of variance.

The questionnaire was completed by 320 of 490 potential respondents (65%), including medical (18%), radiation (8%), orthopedic (22%), and surgical oncologists (45%). Respondents concurred on the use of radiation therapy for margins positive for tumor, for high-grade tumors, for improvement in local control, for tumors larger than 10 cm, and for tumors in close proximity to a neurovascular bundle. Respondents diverged on the use of radiation therapy for tumors 5 to 10 cm in size, for low-grade tumors, for radiation-associated STS, and for survival benefit. Only radiation oncologists felt that radiation therapy was underutilized as a treatment modality (mean [SEM] Likert scale score, 2.44 [0.12]; p < 0.001). There was agreement on the use of chemotherapy.

### Management of unplanned excision for soft-tissue sarcoma with preoperative radiotherapy followed by definitive resection [^112ipt4i]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes after preoperative radiotherapy and definitive surgery for patients who initially had inadvertent excision for sarcoma.

- **Materials and methods**: Treatment records of 44 consecutive patients, who initially underwent unplanned excision of soft-tissue sarcoma between January 2004 and January 2012, were reviewed. All patients had clinically localized disease before treatment and received preoperative external-beam radiotherapy followed by definitive oncologic surgery at our institution.

- **Results**: The median follow-up was 36 months. Residual tumor after preoperative radiotherapy and wound bed excision was identified in 39% (17/44) of the cases. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 5-year local control, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival are 95% (95% confidence interval, 80–99), 86% (95% CI, 69–94), and 94% (95% CI, 79–99), respectively. Perioperative morbidity occurred in 25% of patients (11/44). All patients with perioperative wound complications had lower extremity sarcomas.

- **Conclusions**: Optimal management for unplanned excision of soft-tissue sarcoma is unknown. Our institution has adopted the approach of preoperative radiotherapy, followed by definitive surgery. In our series of 44 patients, local control was excellent at 95%, with perioperative complications seen only in patients with lower extremity sarcomas, suggesting that this is a reasonable approach to manage inadvertently resected sarcoma.

### Toward better soft tissue sarcoma staging: Building on American Joint Committee on Cancer staging systems versions 6 and 7 [^114x51eU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Based on a review of patient data in case conferences over time, we hypothesized that clinically relevant data are omitted in routine soft tissue sarcoma staging.

- **Methods**: We examined subsets of a prospectively collected single institution soft tissue sarcoma database with respect to criteria of the AJCC versions 6 (2002) and 7 (2010) staging systems and examined their clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Relapse-free survival decreases with increasing primary tumor size in four categories, versus two categories used in AJCC 6 and 7 staging. Disease-specific survival decreases over three categories. Conversely, omission of tumor depth as a prognostic factor in version 7 appears supported, since tumor depth is not an independent risk factor for disease-specific survival by multivariate analysis. Patients with nodal disease and no other metastases fare better than patients with other metastases, but have inferior outcomes compared with patients with large high-grade tumors without nodal metastasis. Multivariate analysis identified size, site, grade, age, nodal metastatic disease, and other metastatic disease as independent risk factors for disease-specific survival. Versions 6 and 7 criteria are tacit regarding anatomic site and histology for tumors with identical FNCLCC grade.

- **Conclusions**: Improved patient risk assessment may be achieved by staging using a larger number of size categories. Staging system refinements come at the cost of a larger number of staging categories. Histology or site-specific staging systems, nomograms, or Bayesian belief networks may provide more effective models.

### Soft tissue tumor imaging in adults: European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology-guidelines 2024: Imaging immediately after neoadjuvant therapy in soft tissue sarcoma, soft tissue tumor surveillance, and the role of interventional radiology [^116Tpi1L]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

An update of the first European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) consensus on soft tissue tumor imaging in 2015 became necessary due to technical advancements, further insights into specific entities, and the revised WHO classification (2020) and AJCC staging system (2017). The third part of the revised guidelines covers algorithms and techniques beyond initial imaging, focusing on three main areas. First, imaging after neoadjuvant therapy in soft tissue sarcoma; second, sarcoma surveillance; and third, special aspects, including surveillance of non-malignant entities and the role of interventional radiology.

The study employed a validated Delphi method based on peer-reviewed literature to derive consensus among a panel of 46 specialized musculoskeletal radiologists from 12 European countries. Statements that had undergone interdisciplinary revision were scored online by level of agreement (0 to 10) during two iterative rounds, resulting in classifications of 'group consensus', 'group agreement', or 'lack of agreement'.
The results include 47 statements with comments. Group consensus was reached in 91.5%, group agreement in 6.4%, and lack of agreement in 2.1%. In sarcoma, imaging immediately after neoadjuvant therapy is pivotal for determining therapy effects and for resection planning. Surveillance should include imaging at fixed grade- and type-dependent intervals. Generally, MRI is the method of choice for loco-regional surveillance of soft tissue sarcomas, while chest CT is used to assess metastatic disease. Interventional radiology plays a role, especially in oligometastatic cases.

### Aso practice guidelines series: Soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and superficial trunk [^113eUt6b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of rare malignant tumors arising from mesenchymal tissues, with extremity and superficial trunk STS (eSTS) comprising the majority of cases. The management of localized eSTS requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize oncologic and functional outcomes. This review outlines the natural history, diagnostic workup, and treatment principles for localized eSTS, emphasizing the role of histology-specific considerations in guiding management strategies.

While surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, with the goal of achieving negative margins and preserving limb function, radiotherapy is frequently employed to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Systemic therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, are increasingly being explored in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Recent evidence suggests that chemotherapy may provide a survival benefit in selected high-risk patients. Additionally, emerging data on immune checkpoint inhibitors indicate potential efficacy in specific histologic types and in combination with radiotherapy. Given the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, centralization of care in specialized sarcoma centers is critical to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Pre- and postoperative chemotherapy in localized extremity soft tissue sarcoma: A European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer expert survey [^116KHNtb]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

The management of localized extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is challenging, and the role of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy is unclear and debated among experts.

- **Materials and methods**: Medical oncology experts of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group were asked to participate in this survey on the use of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy in STS. Experts from 12 centers in Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, and The Netherlands agreed to participate and provided their treatment algorithm. Answers were converted into decision trees based on the objective consensus methodology. The decision trees were used as a basis to identify consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Several criteria used for decision-making in extremity STS were identified: chemosensitivity, fitness, grading, location, and size. In addition, resectability and resection status were relevant in the pre- and postoperative settings, respectively. Preoperative chemotherapy is considered in most centers for marginally resectable tumors only. Yet, in some centers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used routinely and partially combined with hyperthermia. Although most centers do not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, some offer this treatment on a regular basis. Radiotherapy is an undisputed treatment modality in extremity STS.

- **Conclusion**: Due to the lack of evidence on the utility of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy in localized extremity STS, treatment strategies vary considerably among European experts.

### The challenge of the management of adolescents and young adults with soft tissue sarcomas [^116eXdGY]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are relatively frequent in adolescents and young adults, and their clinical management may be complex. This complexity is due partly to tumor-associated factors, but also because different approaches have been adopted by pediatric and adult medical oncologists dealing with the same disease. However, times are changing, and in recent years, management has tended to converge towards a common strategy. Continued and increased international collaboration between pediatric and adult sarcoma groups is of critical importance to improve both the quality of treatment and research programs dedicated to young patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: What is standard, what is new [^111TYQwj]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients not eligible for surgery, systemic treatments — comprising standard chemotherapy and newer biological compounds — still play the most relevant role in disease management. An anthracycline and alkylating agent combination has been the cornerstone of chemotherapy in STS for over 30 years, although its superiority over anthracycline as a single agent remains debated. Efforts continue to enhance the activity and reduce the toxicity of this combination, explore the upfront efficacy of known active agents in sarcoma, and develop new biological compounds. Beyond the first line, evidence for medical treatment in STS becomes less robust and more dependent on histology. The introduction of kinases and small molecule inhibitors in the treatment arsenal for STS represents a significant advancement. Preliminary data on immunotherapy are also available and discussed in this review.

European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

A validated Delphi method, based on peer-reviewed literature, was employed to derive consensus among a panel of 46 specialized tumor subcommittee radiologists of the ESSR from 12 European countries. Institutional review board approval was not required as patients were not involved. Statements were developed with comments based on literature searches on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. These were validated by two orthopedic tumor surgeons, a specialized sarcoma pathologist, a radiation oncologist, and a radiologist with expertise in chest and abdominal radiology and a secondary specialization in nuclear medicine.

For each statement, panel members scored their level of agreement using an online questionnaire (Google Forms®). Suggestions for adjustments were incorporated for subsequent questionnaire rounds either as alternatives or optimizations of the statement. In three personal meetings, open questions and comments were discussed. Scores ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 as the highest grade of agreement. A minimum statement scoring required a median of at least 8 and an interquartile range of less than 4.

- **Group consensus**: Defined as at least 80% of voters scoring at least 8.
- **Group agreement**: Defined as 67–79% of voters scoring at least 8.
- **Lack of agreement**: Assigned if the previous conditions were not met.

After round two, the rating process was terminated.

### Do patients treated with an unplanned resection for small superficial soft tissue sarcomas have worse long-term survival than those initially treated with an oncologic resection [^1148j34K]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Low credibility.

Histologic grade, size, and depth are well-known prognostic factors in soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Small (< 5 cm) and superficial STS generally have an excellent prognosis when treated with appropriate surgery. However, they are often misdiagnosed and mistreated. We reported that in midterm follow-up (5 to 7 years), patients with unplanned resections of tumors with positive margins who immediately underwent a reoperation with margin-widening re-resection and postoperative radiotherapy had survival comparable to that of patients who were initially treated correctly. In that article, we included STS larger than 5 cm, deep STS, and individuals with local recurrence. However, we wanted to evaluate the impact of unplanned resection on the survival of patients who had STS with the best prognosis, small and superficial STS, with two groups that were as homogeneous as possible.

- **Question/purpose**: Do patients with small and superficial STS who underwent an unplanned resection have worse prognosis in the long term than those who were initially treated correctly?

- **Methods**: We exclusively evaluated patients with small (< 5 cm) and superficial (to the deep fascia) STS. We systematically excluded deep STS. Among this subset, we identified 93 patients with superficial STS. We excluded patients with local relapse, metastatic disease, superficial STS of the head or neck, those with insufficient clinical or dosimetric information, and patients with follow-up of less than 2 years. Furthermore, our focus on investigating the most benign and homogeneous STS prompted us to exclude pa

### Rapidly growing nodule on the knee [^114WE4km]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the most appropriate next step in management?

- **A. Sentinel lymph node dissection for staging**: Incorrect. As a benign neoplasm, there is no role for sentinel lymph node dissection or any staging for proliferative fasciitis.

- **B. Intralesional corticosteroids**: Incorrect. This pseudosarcomatous lesion would show very little, if any, response to intralesional corticosteroids.

- **C. Local radiation**: Incorrect. The treatment for fibrosarcoma depends on clinical staging; however, it often includes adjuvant radiation for larger or high-grade tumors. Anthracyclines are often used as chemotherapy of choice. Because proliferative fasciitis is a benign neoplasm, radiation is not indicated.

- **D. Clinical observation**: Correct. Although proliferative fasciitis is rapidly growing and has some histological features that can be initially confused with soft tissue sarcomas because of their cellularity and immature appearance of proliferating cells, this is a benign neoplasm. Although clinical observation is the correct management for this rare entity, it is often excised for biopsy during the diagnostic work-up, as with our patient, to rule out the malignant conditions on the clinical differential diagnosis.

- **E. Re-excision with 5-mm margins**: Incorrect. As a benign neoplasm, clear margins are not required for proliferative fasciitis. Elective excision may be requested by the patient owing to appearance, rapid enlargement, or confirmatory biopsy needs, but it is not necessary for margin clearance.

### Conformity to clinical practice guidelines at initial management in adult soft tissue and visceral tumors since the implementation of the NetSarc network in Eastern France [^115NyB9A]. The Oncologist (2019). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous tumors that are difficult to diagnose. The aim of this study was to evaluate local practices and conformity to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for their initial diagnostic management.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients were carriers of a soft tissue or visceral tumor and were presented at a sarcoma tumor board (STB) between 2010 and 2016. Conformity to CPGs was evaluated using ten criteria designed for this purpose. Associations between different factors and conformity to composite criteria, reflecting the three main diagnostic steps (imaging, biopsy, and histological report), were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 643 patients were included. A preoperative tumor imaging assessment and a biopsy were performed according to CPGs in 80.8% and 36.8% of the cases, respectively. When done, the first surgical resection was R0 in 30.3% of cases, R1 in 28.6%, and R2 in 10.9%. The rest of the operated patients with sarcoma had a second surgical excision (11.4%), an intraoperative fragmentation (4.3%), or margins were unknown (14.4%). Six of the ten quality criteria presented a conformity rate higher than 70%. Two criteria with a conformity rate lower than 20% were the most controversial: presentation at a STB before biopsy and freezing of a tumor fragment. A multivariate analysis revealed that the common predictor of nonconformity to composite criteria was the initial management in a nonexpert center.

- **Conclusion**: Initial diagnostic management requires improvement, especially outside of specialized centers.

### Influence of specialty and clinical experience on treatment sequencing in the multimodal management of soft tissue extremity sarcoma [^112fR5CB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Although multimodal management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is the standard of care, considerable variation exists in the sequencing of radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CT). Our goal was to identify factors responsible for this variation.

Members of specialty societies with an interest in STS were emailed a questionnaire about multimodal treatment of STS. Survey responses were scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = always preoperative and 5 = always postoperative) and analyzed by specialty, years in practice, and percentage of practice consisting of STS.

The questionnaire was completed by 320 (65%) of 490 physicians, including medical oncologists (18%), radiation oncologists (8%), orthopedic oncologists (22%), surgical oncologists (45%), and others (7%). Respondents were evenly split on the use of neoadjuvant RT (mean 3.03 ± 0.06) and showed a slight preference for neoadjuvant CT (2.89 ± 0.06). Radiation oncologists (2.52 ± 0.18), physicians with a > 75% STS practice (2.58 ± 0.17), and those in practice > 10 years (2.51 ± 0.16) exhibited varying preferences.

Factors influencing the choice for neoadjuvant RT included well-defined treatment volume, increased acute morbidity, and decreased late morbidity. For CT, factors were in-situ disease monitoring and early treatment of micrometastases.

Treatment sequencing in STS is influenced by specialty and clinical experience, with no clear consensus. These patterns may inform future guidelines for the management of STS.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2016, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1178Ysxu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare solid tumors of mesenchymal cell origin that display a heterogeneous mix of clinical and pathologic characteristics. STS can develop from fat, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The evaluation and treatment of patients with STS require a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors. The complete NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma (available at NCCN.org) provide recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of extremity/superficial trunk/head and neck STS, as well as intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal STS, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, desmoid tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

This manuscript discusses guiding principles for the diagnosis and staging of STS and evidence for treatment modalities that include surgery, radiation, chemoradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.

### Evidence-based recommendations for local therapy for soft tissue sarcomas [^112s73vT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

There has been a gradual shift in the local treatment of soft tissue sarcomas from amputation and similar radical resectional approaches to more conservative, function-preserving surgery combined with radiotherapy. This progress has been enabled by small, single-institution randomized trials that demonstrated the superiority of this more conservative, combined-modality approach.

In the new millennium, attention has shifted to defining subsets of patients who might be adequately treated by surgery alone and defining the optimal sequence of surgery and radiation for patients who require both types of local therapy. There is considerable discussion and debate surrounding the issue of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy for patients with localized soft tissue sarcomas.

- **Standard of care**: Adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard of care for adults with subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas that typically occur in pediatric patients, such as Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. However, it is not warranted in patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease (stages I and II).

For patients with higher risk disease (stage III), the available randomized trials do not convincingly demonstrate a clinical benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, a thorough discussion of potential risks and benefits is necessary when considering adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III disease.

Regarding medical management for soft tissue sarcoma, particularly concerning the management of localized disease with postoperative radiotherapy, the ASTRO 2021 guidelines recommend considering postoperative radiotherapy after the initial oncologic resection. This recommendation applies if surgery and radiotherapy are indicated for patients with primary, localized extremity, and truncal soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in specific clinical circumstances, such as uncontrolled pain, bleeding, or fungating tumors. It is also advised when the risk of wound healing complications outweighs the risk of late toxicity.

Regarding medical management for soft tissue sarcoma, specifically the management of advanced disease (chemotherapy), the ERN GENTURIS/ESMO/EURACAN 2021 guidelines recommend offering neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors as standard treatment for patients with advanced NTRK-rearranged sarcomas. Consider offering neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors in the preoperative setting when cytoreduction can improve morbidity and function.

### Efficacy and safety of adjuvant radiotherapy in re-excised soft-tissue sarcoma after unplanned resection [^115DBbA6]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare, heterogeneous diseases with an incidence of less than 1 per million per year. Surgical resection is the mainstay of localized STS management. Because of STS heterogeneity and complexity, prognosis may vary and has been shown to improve in patients with STS treated in expert centers. Unfortunately, 20%-40% of STS patients experience a non-oncological unplanned resection (UPR), leading to shorter distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; OR 0.56, P < 0.001). Surgical management after UPR has long been debated. Some authors recommend systematic re-excision, while others suggest a "wait-and-see" approach until detectable local recurrence. Nevertheless, a recent French cohort reported longer local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) in re-excised STS.

After UPR, promising results have been reported using definitive radiotherapy (RT) or preoperative RT. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) recommends that RT be systematically performed before re-excision. Nevertheless, this is based on the results of planned resected patients and a small retrospective study with limited follow-up that exploratorily compared preoperative RT (n = 12) to adjuvant or no RT (both n = 11) after UPR. Moreover, while a boost of 10–16 Gy is systematically recommended by ASTRO in the post-operative situation, European and French guidelines only recommend this higher dose complement according to the risk of local recurrence. Therefore, after UPR, RT is often performed in the presence of residual disease or in case of documented initial residual disease.

Early, accurate diagnosis is crucial for the prognosis of patients with soft tissue sarcomas. To this end, standardization of imaging algorithms, technical requirements, and reporting is a prerequisite. Since the first European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) consensus in 2015, technical achievements, further insights into specific entities, and the revised WHO-classification (2020) and AJCC staging system (2017) made an update necessary. The guidelines are intended to support radiologists in their decision-making and contribute to interdisciplinary tumor board discussions.

- **Materials and methods**: A validated Delphi method based on peer-reviewed literature was used to derive consensus among a panel of 46 specialized musculoskeletal radiologists from 12 European countries. Statements were scored online by level of agreement (0 to 10) during two iterative rounds. Either "group consensus", "group agreement", or "lack of agreement" was achieved.

- **Results**: Eight sections were defined that finally contained 145 statements with comments. Overall, group consensus was reached in 95.9% of cases, and group agreement in 4.1%. This communication contains the first part, consisting of the imaging algorithm for suspected soft tissue tumors, methods for local imaging, and the role of tumor centers.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound represents the initial triage imaging modality for accessible and small tumors. MRI is the modality of choice for the characterization and local staging of most soft tissue tumors. CT is indicated in special situations.

### International soft tissue sarcoma consortium (INSTRuCT) consensus statement: Imaging recommendations for the management of rhabdomyosarcoma [^1136LBQb]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue neoplasm in the pediatric population. The survival rate of children with rhabdomyosarcoma has only marginally improved over the past 25 years and remains poor for those with metastatic disease. A significant challenge to advancing the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma is the relative rarity of this disease, which necessitates years to complete clinical trials. Progress can be accelerated by international cooperation and sharing national experiences. This necessitates agreement on a common language to describe patient cohorts and consensus standards to guide diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment. These goals formed the premise for creating the International Soft Tissue Sarcoma Consortium (INSTRuCT) in 2017.

Multidisciplinary members of this consortium have since developed international consensus statements on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas. Herein, members of the INSTRuCT Diagnostic Imaging Working Group present international consensus recommendations for imaging of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma at diagnosis, staging, and during and after completion of therapy. The intent is to promote a standardized imaging approach for pediatric patients with this malignancy to create more reliable comparisons of clinical trial results internationally, thereby accelerating progress in managing rhabdomyosarcoma and improving survival.

### Imaging recommendations for soft-tissue sarcomas: Model guidelines from diagnosis to post-treatment follow-up [^111W7kVq]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies of mesenchymal origin with an incidence of 4–8 per 100,000 within Europe; they consist of various subtypes, each expressing distinct morphological, histopathological, and molecular features. According to the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, STSs are divided into 11 broad categories comprising approximately 80 entities. STS management guidelines are constantly evolving due to the development of newer diagnostic methods and treatments, including the discovery of new chemotherapeutic agents and immunomodulators. Although the referral, diagnostic, and management pathways may vary in different healthcare systems, the core management principles remain the same.

This article explores various established STS guidelines on imaging diagnosis, staging, and follow-up by international societies. It also describes radiologic utility in assessing recurrence and postoperative mimics. The objective is to provide radiologists and clinicians with imaging guidance useful at various stages of STS management.

### Modern multidisciplinary management of soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity and trunk [^113CUQrM]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremity and trunk are heterogeneous and rare tumors that require coordinated multidisciplinary management. Surgical resection remains the backbone of treatment for localized tumors, with the addition of radiotherapy to surgery to achieve high rates of local control. Despite this, overall survival is limited due to significant distant metastatic risk and a lack of efficacious systemic therapies.

Clinical trials have produced conflicting results on the impact of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for patients with localized disease, leaving systemic treatment decisions largely guided by shared decision-making and prognostic prediction tools such as nomograms. This article will review the foundational data and the latest developments in surgical, radiotherapy, and systemic management supporting practice guidelines for localized STS of the extremity and trunk.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: What is standard, what is new [^114GoWuF]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients not eligible for surgery, systemic treatments, including standard chemotherapy and newer biological compounds, continue to play the most relevant role in the management of the disease. An anthracycline and alkylating agent combination has formed the cornerstone of chemotherapy in STS for more than 30 years, yet its value over the administration of anthracycline as a single agent is still debated. Efforts have been made to improve the activity and minimize the toxicity of the combination, as well as to explore the upfront efficacy of agents known to be active in sarcoma and to develop new biological compounds.

Nevertheless, beyond the first line, evidence for medical treatment in STS is less robust and is driven by histology. Thus, the introduction of kinases and small molecule inhibitors in the treatment armamentarium for STS is a major achievement. Preliminary data on immunotherapy are also available and discussed in this review.

### Prediction tools for the personalized management of soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremity [^111aUEap]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas represent a group of rare and heterogeneous malignant neoplasms, with more than 100 histological subtypes. They arise from mesenchymal cells and account for 1% of adult malignancies. The estimated incidence is 4.71 per 100,000 people per year in Europe. They may occur in any anatomical site, but the limbs are the most common primary site for a soft-tissue sarcoma.

Because of the heterogeneity in presentation and outcome within the spectrum of soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities (eSTSs), several prognostic instruments have been developed to classify patients with these tumors into risk groups to optimize their management. Historically, conventional staging systems such as the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification were widely used for the stratification of patients. However, important prognostic patient and tumor-related factors such as age and histological subtype are not incorporated in the TNM staging system.

In recent years, several new prognostic instruments such as prediction tools and nomograms have been developed for eSTSs. These tools are generally easier to use through applications on smartphones, are more accurate (as they generate an individual prognosis based on multiple characteristics that may vary simultaneously), and provide a prognosis which is more easily understood when compared with conventional staging systems.

In this annotation, we discuss the concepts of managing eSTSs and explore the available prediction tools for the management of these rare tumors, providing clinicians and researchers with instr

### Evolving treatment of soft tissue sarcoma [^114v7EQL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas comprise multiple histologic subtypes, occur at a number of anatomic sites, and require individualized treatment. Over the past five years, four new drugs were approved for sarcoma, most of which are driven by histology or the anticipated response to treatment. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for resectable tumors.

For unresectable or metastatic disease, doxorubicin remains the backbone of chemotherapy, but other agents have improved on its single-agent efficacy. Chief among them is olaratumab, which, in combination with doxorubicin, is preferred over doxorubicin alone in the updated NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.
