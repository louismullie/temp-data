## Question

Treatment of cardiogenic shock

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify the etiology-specific management, especially AMI-CS versus HF-CS. Next, I will review pharmacologic therapy choices and escalation. After that, I need to check the role, selection, and timing of temporary mechanical circulatory support. I will then consider special populations and phenotypes, including sex, age, and mixed shock. Finally, I should confirm systems-of-care elements, monitoring and weaning strategies, and summarize the evidence gaps and practical algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: establish airway and breathing, secure vascular access, and start continuous monitoring while rapidly assessing perfusion and shock severity. I need to ensure we do not delay definitive therapy for AMI-CS, so early activation of a shock team and consideration of transfer to a Level 1 CS center are critical if local resources are limited, and I should double-check that this is supported by ACC/AHA guidance and SCAI consensus on staging and transfer logistics [^9e638039] [^0860f769] [^613804e8].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic assessment framework. The SCAI shock stages A through E provide a standardized language and correlate with mortality, and I should confirm that daily or even more frequent reassessment is recommended in the first 24 hours when instability is high. Invasive hemodynamics with an arterial line and consideration of a pulmonary artery catheter can refine phenotype and guide therapy, but I need to remember that PA catheter use is a Class 2b recommendation rather than routine, so I should individualize based on severity and uncertainty [^ad5a8bdf] [^0ad32ad1] [^220df55d].

> I will now examine etiology-specific management, starting with AMI-CS. Immediate coronary angiography and PCI of the infarct-related artery is the only intervention with randomized evidence of survival benefit, and I should confirm that culprit-lesion-only strategies outperform multivessel PCI in CULPRIT-SHOCK. If PCI fails or is not feasible, emergency CABG is reasonable, and I need to ensure we avoid routine IABP in AMI-CS without mechanical complications because contemporary guidelines discourage it [^65c4e753] [^77dcbf3f] [^c52168f0] [^b8327e6b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fibrinolysis. I initially thought fibrinolysis is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock, but wait, I should verify the guideline nuance. ESC 2023 allows fibrinolysis if primary PCI cannot be achieved within 120 minutes and mechanical complications are excluded, so I need to correct that blanket statement and frame it as a conditional, time-sensitive alternative when PCI is delayed [^68d32ea7].

> Next, I should review HF-CS, where evidence is sparse. There are no RCT-proven mortality benefits beyond guideline-directed medical therapy and team-based care, so I need to ensure we apply the same principles of early recognition, hemodynamic phenotyping, and judicious use of inotropes and vasopressors, with early consideration of tMCS when pharmacologic support fails. I should confirm that consensus statements emphasize individualized decisions and the need for HF-CS–specific trials [^b3f4f839] [^8989c272] [^f773b6b1].

> Let me think about pharmacologic therapy and escalation. Norepinephrine is a reasonable first-line vasopressor for hypotensive CS, and I should double-check that epinephrine is associated with more arrhythmias and is generally avoided as first-line. Inotropes like dobutamine or milrinone are indicated to maintain perfusion, but I need to ensure we use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration given risks of tachyarrhythmias and myocardial oxygen consumption. The DOREMI trial showed no difference between dobutamine and milrinone on a composite outcome, reinforcing that agent selection should be individualized to hemodynamics and comorbidities [^82241dc1] [^6e691252] [^f03882e6].

> I should confirm fluid strategy next. Routine fluid loading is inappropriate in left-sided CS and can worsen pulmonary edema, so fluids should be reserved for carefully selected scenarios with clear hypovolemia or right-sided involvement, and otherwise avoided. This is supported by ESICM 2025 and reinforced by appropriateness panels in CS [^3a57bd25] [^58b87117].

> Now, I need to check the role and timing of temporary mechanical circulatory support. Routine use of tMCS has not shown mortality benefit in RCTs, but selective use as a bridge to recovery, decision, bridge-to-bridge, or transplant is reasonable when end-organ function cannot be maintained with drugs alone. Early escalation in deteriorating patients may mitigate multiorgan failure, and I should confirm that device choice should match hemodynamic goals, ventricular unloading needs, and anticipated duration, with daily readiness-to-wean assessments once stabilized [^5001849c] [^81438b7e] [^9b7ebe6e] [^42bd1377].

> But wait, what if the patient is in mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. I need to ensure we recognize this phenotype early because it often requires combination vasopressor-inotrope therapy and may respond less to MCS due to profound vasoplegia. Invasive hemodynamics help distinguish it, and I should be cautious not to undertreat vasodilatory components while focusing on cardiac output alone [^31648440] [^880f05dc].

> Next, I should review special populations. Women are less likely to receive MCS and have higher adjusted mortality, so I need to ensure we actively address sex-specific barriers, include adequate female representation in trials, and consider device profiles and vascular access strategies that reduce complications. Older adults require comprehensive geriatric assessment rather than age-based exclusion, and pediatric CS management relies on expert consensus given limited data, emphasizing early consultation and vasoactive support tailored to physiology [^79e2e936] [^0d90f082] [^ac55448e] [^78f2ca5f].

> I will now examine systems-of-care elements. Level 1 CS centers with 24/7 PCI, surgical backup, and tMCS capability should be the regional hubs, with early communication and transfer triggers for refractory shock or high-risk presentations. Shock teams with standardized protocols are associated with faster appropriate therapy and improved outcomes, and I should confirm that regionalization guidance and team activation criteria are explicitly endorsed by ACC/AHA/SCAI documents [^0860f769] [^cfa277be] [^d6294cf1].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and weaning. Dynamic reassessment every 2–4 hours early on, with trending lactate, urine output, mental status, and invasive hemodynamics when available, guides timely escalation or de-escalation. For tMCS weaning, I should confirm that daily evaluation of hemodynamic stability, pharmacologic support needs, volume status, and reversal of the precipitant informs a stepwise flow reduction, recognizing that evidence for weaning protocols remains limited and requires multidisciplinary judgment [^8f26741e] [^9b7ebe6e].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and where we lack data. Outside of early revascularization for AMI-CS, most CS therapies rest on low-certainty evidence or expert consensus, including inotropes, vasopressors, and tMCS, which explains persistent high mortality and the emphasis on individualized, team-based care. This underscores the need for better phenotyping, standardized endpoints, and adequately powered RCTs in both AMI-CS and HF-CS populations [^a0385d7f] [^e51e1d8a] [^b3f4f839].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. Stabilize and stage using SCAI, identify etiology, and activate a shock team early. For AMI-CS, proceed to immediate culprit-lesion PCI unless contraindicated, consider fibrinolysis only if PCI is delayed beyond 120 minutes without mechanical complications, and avoid routine IABP. For HF-CS, optimize GDMT and use inotropes and vasopressors to maintain perfusion, escalating to tMCS if refractory. For all, avoid routine fluids, reassess frequently, and transfer early to Level 1 centers when indicated, aligning choices with patient-specific factors such as sex, age, and mixed-shock physiology [^9e638039] [^65c4e753] [^68d32ea7] [^b8327e6b] [^3a57bd25] [^0860f769].

Cardiogenic shock is a high-mortality syndrome [^a0385d7f] requiring **rapid, team-based care** [^e19afb7b] and **early revascularization** for AMI-CS [^77dcbf3f]. Initial management focuses on **airway, breathing, and circulation**, with early invasive hemodynamics [^220df55d] and SCAI staging [^ad5a8bdf] to guide therapy. Norepinephrine is **first-line** [^82241dc1] for hypotension, with dobutamine or milrinone for low output [^f03882e6]; avoid routine fluids in LV failure [^3a57bd25]. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella, ECMO, IABP) is reserved for refractory cases [^5001849c] or specific indications (e.g. mechanical complications) [^e9416fa7], and should be initiated early if pharmacologic therapy fails [^0ad32ad1]. Transfer to a Level 1 shock center [^0860f769] is essential for advanced therapies, and ongoing reassessment is critical to adjust support and plan weaning [^8f26741e].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation; intubate if respiratory failure or altered mental status [^bb4e9b79].

- **Circulation**: Establish two large-bore IVs, continuous ECG, invasive arterial pressure, and consider a pulmonary artery catheter for hemodynamic profiling [^220df55d] [^613804e8].

- **Rapid diagnostics**: ECG, echocardiography, chest X-ray, and labs (troponin, lactate, BNP, renal function, electrolytes) to identify etiology and organ dysfunction [^bb4e9b79].

- **SCAI shock staging**: Use Stages A–E to standardize severity and guide escalation [^ad5a8bdf] [^71c76f66].

---

## Pharmacologic management

### Vasopressors and inotropes

- **First-line vasopressor**: Norepinephrine is preferred to restore perfusion pressure with less arrhythmia risk than dopamine or epinephrine [^82241dc1] [^6e691252].

- **Inotropes**: Dobutamine or milrinone for low cardiac output; milrinone is useful in pulmonary hypertension or beta-blocker toxicity but may cause hypotension [^f03882e6].

- **Avoidance**: Minimize use of pure vasoconstrictors (e.g. phenylephrine) that can reduce cardiac output [^6e691252].

---

### Fluid management

Avoid **routine fluids** in LV failure; use small boluses only if clear hypovolemia or RV involvement is present [^3a57bd25] [^908cb1d2].

---

## Mechanical circulatory support (MCS)

MCS is indicated for **refractory shock** or specific scenarios (e.g. mechanical complications) [^5001849c] [^e9416fa7]. Options include:

| **Device** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Impella (microaxial pump) | - Severe LV failure <br/> - AMI-CS <br/> - High PCI risk | - Active unloading <br/> - Hemodynamic support | - Bleeding <br/> - Vascular injury <br/> - Hemolysis |
| VA-ECMO | - Biventricular failure <br/> - Refractory shock <br/> - Cardiac arrest | - Full circulatory support <br/> - Oxygenation | - Bleeding <br/> - Thrombosis <br/> - Limb ischemia |
| IABP | - Mechanical complications (MR, VSR) <br/> - Bridge to definitive therapy | - Afterload reduction <br/> - Coronary perfusion | - Limited support <br/> - No mortality benefit in AMI-CS [^b8327e6b] |

---

Early initiation of MCS is critical when pharmacologic therapy fails; **delay increases mortality** [^0ad32ad1] [^42bd1377].

---

## Revascularization strategies

Immediate **coronary angiography and PCI** of the infarct-related artery are indicated in AMI-CS [^65c4e753] [^77dcbf3f]. Culprit-lesion-only PCI reduces 30-day death or renal replacement therapy compared with multivessel PCI [^77dcbf3f]. If PCI is not feasible, emergency CABG is reasonable [^c52168f0].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and regionalization

A **shock team** with cardiology, critical care, interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, and advanced heart failure specialists improves outcomes [^cfa277be] [^6ce3e961]. Transfer to a Level 1 shock center with 24/7 PCI, MCS, and transplant capabilities is recommended for refractory cases [^0860f769] [^d6294cf1].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous reassessment of perfusion, organ function, and hemodynamics is essential; adjust therapy and plan MCS weaning as the patient stabilizes [^8f26741e] [^9b7ebe6e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Right ventricular failure**: Optimize preload, reduce RV afterload, and consider inotropes (milrinone, dobutamine) or MCS (Impella RP, VA-ECMO) [^notfound].

- **Mixed shock**: Combine inotropes and vasopressors; invasive monitoring guides therapy [^31648440].

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize decisions; age alone should not preclude advanced therapies [^ac55448e].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

- **Stabilize**: Airway, breathing, circulation, diagnostics, SCAI staging.

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Norepinephrine for hypotension; dobutamine or milrinone for low output.

- **Fluids**: Avoid routine fluids; use selectively.

- **MCS**: Early initiation for refractory shock or specific indications.

- **Revascularization**: Immediate PCI for AMI-CS; culprit-lesion-only strategy.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Shock team and transfer to Level 1 center.

- **Monitoring**: Continuous reassessment and adjustment.

---

Effective cardiogenic shock care hinges on **early recognition**, **rapid stabilization**, and **coordinated escalation** — especially early revascularization for AMI-CS and timely MCS for refractory cases — within a multidisciplinary, protocolized framework [^a0385d7f].

### A standardized and comprehensive approach to the management of cardiogenic shock [^98d9c60c]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a hemodynamically complex syndrome characterized by a low cardiac output that often culminates in multiorgan system failure and death. Despite recent advances, clinical outcomes remain poor, with mortality rates exceeding 40%. In the absence of adequately powered randomized controlled trials to guide therapy, best practices for shock management remain nonuniform. Emerging data from North American registries, however, support the use of standardized protocols focused on rapid diagnosis, early intervention, ongoing hemodynamic assessment, and multidisciplinary longitudinal care. In this review, the authors examine the pathophysiology and phenotypes of cardiogenic shock, benefits and limitations of current therapies, and they propose a standardized and team-based treatment algorithm. Lastly, they discuss future research opportunities to address current gaps in clinical knowledge.

### Cardiogenic shock [^a0385d7f]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a complex syndrome defined by systemic hypoperfusion and inadequate cardiac output arising from a wide array of underlying causes. Although the understanding of cardiogenic shock epidemiology, specific subphenotypes, haemodynamics, and cardiogenic shock severity staging has evolved, few therapeutic interventions have shown survival benefit. Results from seminal randomised controlled trials support early revascularisation of the culprit vessel in infarct-related cardiogenic shock and provide evidence of improved survival with the use of temporary circulatory support in selected patients. However, numerous questions remain unanswered, including optimal pharmacotherapy regimens, the role of mechanical circulatory support devices, management of secondary organ dysfunction, and best supportive care. This Review summarises current definitions, pathophysiological principles, and management approaches in cardiogenic shock, and highlights key knowledge gaps to advance individualised shock therapy and the evidence-based ethical use of modern technology and resources in cardiogenic shock.

### Optimising trial design for cardiogenic shock: insights from the sixth critical care clinical trialists workshop [^e51e1d8a]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Despite substantial advancements in the management of cardiogenic shock, mortality rates remain greater than 40%. Trials have shown that increasing survival rates in cardiogenic shock is challenging. Even the most successful trials show 5–15% reductions in mortality, and gains have been restricted to acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock, representing approximately 5% of the population with cardiogenic shock. Trials studying pharmacological strategies in all populations with cardiogenic shock have been consistently neutral or negative. The reasons are complex and include heterogeneity in cardiogenic shock phenotypes, timing of patient inclusion, high prevalence of multiorgan failure and cardiac arrest, and unrealistic estimated treatment effects that restrict sample size with sometimes inadequate funding leading to underpowered trials. In June, 2024, international experts from the fields of cardiology, anaesthesiology, critical care medicine, biostatistics, government regulation of trials, and patient advocacy convened at the sixth Critical Care Clinical Trialists Workshop to reflect on how to improve the design of future randomised clinical trials in cardiogenic shock. This Position Paper summarises the results of discussions regarding what an optimal randomised controlled trial on cardiogenic shock should entail in terms of population selection, primary objectives, statistical analysis, and incorporation of the patient's perspective.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood and maintain an adequate blood supply for other vital organs. Cardiogenic shock has a death rate of about 60% and is the major cause of death in patients hospitalized for a heart attack. Getting immediate medical treatment for a heart attack is important in preventing the development of cardiogenic shock. The June 7, 2006, issue of JAMA includes an article about improving long-term survival for patients who have had cardiogenic shock.

Cold, clammy skin Low urine output Confusion or changes in alertness or unresponsiveness Diagnosis The history and physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram can help doctors determine why the heart is failing to pump blood. Treatment Careful monitoring in an intensive care unit is necessary. Further treatment depends on the cause. Fluids and medications given intravenously are used to maintain blood flow. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support the lungs and breathing.

Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery may restore blood flow after a myocardial infarction. Other devices may be helpful, such as an intra-aortic balloon pump, which inflates and deflates a balloon placed in the aorta to help the heart circulate blood.

Objectives

To review a contemporary approach to the management of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS).

Data Sources

We reviewed salient medical literature regarding CS.

Study Selection

We included professional society scientific statements and clinical studies examining outcomes in patients with CS, with a focus on randomized clinical trials.

Data Extraction

We extracted salient study results and scientific statement recommendations regarding the management of CS.

Data Synthesis

Professional society recommendations were integrated with evaluated studies.

Conclusions

CS results in short-term mortality exceeding 30% despite standard therapy. While acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been the focus of most CS research, heart failure-related CS now predominates at many centers. CS can present with a wide spectrum of shock severity, including patients who are normotensive despite ongoing hypoperfusion. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention Shock Classification categorizes patients with or at risk of CS according to shock severity, which predicts mortality. The CS population includes a heterogeneous mix of phenotypes defined by ventricular function, hemodynamic profile, biomarkers, and other clinical variables. Integrating the shock severity and CS phenotype with nonmodifiable risk factors for mortality can guide clinical decision-making and prognostication. Identifying and treating the cause of CS is crucial for success, including early culprit vessel revascularization for AMI. Vasopressors and inotropes titrated to restore arterial pressure and perfusion are the cornerstone of initial medical therapy for CS. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is indicated for appropriately selected patients as a bridge to recovery, decision, durable MCS, or heart transplant. Randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated better survival with the routine use of temporary MCS in patients with CS. Accordingly, a multidisciplinary team-based approach should be used to tailor the type of hemodynamic support to each individual CS patient's needs based on shock severity, phenotype, and exit strategy.

Cardiogenic shock is a common clinical condition with high in-hospital mortality. Early application of appropriate interventions for cardiogenic shock-including medical therapies, revascularization, temporary hemodynamic support devices, and durable mechanical circulatory support-may improve outcomes. The number and complexity of therapies for cardiogenic shock are increasing, making time-dependent decision-making more challenging. A multidisciplinary cardiogenic shock team is recommended to guide the rapid and efficient use of these available treatments. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^2fc83227]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of cardiogenic shock is an ongoing challenge. Despite all efforts and tremendous use of resources, mortality remains high. Whilst reversing the underlying cause, restoring/maintaining organ perfusion and function are cornerstones of management. The presence of comorbidities and preexisting organ dysfunction increases management complexity, aiming to integrate the needs of vital organs in each individual patient. This review provides a comprehensive overview of contemporary literature regarding the definition and classification of cardiogenic shock, its pathophysiology, diagnosis, laboratory evaluation, and monitoring. Further, we distill the latest evidence in pharmacologic therapy and the use of mechanical circulatory support including recently published randomized-controlled trials as well as future directions of research, integrating this within an international group of authors to provide a global perspective. Finally, we explore the need for individualization, especially in the face of neutral randomized trials which may be related to a dilution of a potential benefit of an intervention (i.e., average effect) in this heterogeneous clinical syndrome, including the use of novel biomarkers, artificial intelligence, and machine learning approaches to identify specific endotypes of cardiogenic shock (i.e., subclasses with distinct underlying biological/molecular mechanisms) to support a more personalized medicine beyond the syndromic approach of cardiogenic shock.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the evaluation and management of cardiogenic shock: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^9e638039]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology cardiogenic shock concise clinical guidance — general clinical assumptions state that the guidance is intended for adult patients and that pediatric presentations of cardiogenic shock (CS) differ and may require a modified Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) system. The principal focus applies to patients hospitalized due to CS secondary to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) or heart failure (HF-CS), and the guidance is intended for clinicians across a broad array of disciplines in diverse clinical settings. The writing committee endorses the evidence-based approach recommended in the 2021 ACC/American Heart Association/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization and in the 2022 American Heart Association/ACC/Heart Failure Society of America Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. Optimal care decisions should reflect evidence-based guidelines and the committee endorses a shared decision-making model, especially where clinical equipoise exists due to treatment uncertainty. This Concise Clinical Guidance is based predominantly on expert consensus, is not intended to supersede good clinical judgment, and interdisciplinary consultation, communication, and collaboration is strongly encouraged. As new data emerge, clinicians should thoughtfully incorporate novel discoveries and scientific evidence into their clinical practice.

### Contemporary management of cardiogenic shock: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^02abfb40]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a high-acuity, potentially complex, and hemodynamically diverse state of end-organ hypoperfusion that is frequently associated with multisystem organ failure. Despite improving survival in recent years, patient morbidity and mortality remain high, and there are few evidence-based therapeutic interventions known to clearly improve patient outcomes. This scientific statement on cardiogenic shock summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, causes, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock; reviews contemporary best medical, surgical, mechanical circulatory support, and palliative care practices; advocates for the development of regionalized systems of care; and outlines future research priorities.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology and contemporary management of cardiogenic shock-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^a6de162d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex multifactorial clinical syndrome with extremely high mortality, developing as a continuum, and progressing from the initial insult (underlying cause) to the subsequent occurrence of organ failure and death. There is a large spectrum of CS presentations resulting from the interaction between an acute cardiac insult and a patient's underlying cardiac and overall medical condition. Phenotyping patients with CS may have clinical impact on management because classification would support initiation of appropriate therapies. CS management should consider appropriate organization of the health care services, and therapies must be given to the appropriately selected patients, in a timely manner, whilst avoiding iatrogenic harm. Although several consensus-driven algorithms have been proposed, CS management remains challenging and substantial investments in research and development have not yielded proof of efficacy and safety for most of the therapies tested, and outcome in this condition remains poor. Future studies should consider the identification of the new pathophysiological targets, and high-quality translational research should facilitate incorporation of more targeted interventions in clinical research protocols, aimed to improve individual patient outcomes. Designing outcome clinical trials in CS remains particularly challenging in this critical and very costly scenario in cardiology, but information from these trials is imperiously needed to better inform the guidelines and clinical practice. The goal of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the definition, epidemiology, underlying causes, pathophysiology and management of CS based on important lessons from clinical trials and registries, with a focus on improving in-hospital management.

### Cardiogenic shock: diagnosis, phenotyping and management [^fe6264f3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a state of critical end-organ hypoperfusion caused by primary cardiac failure, in which the heart cannot generate sufficient output despite adequate preload and is associated with very high mortality rates. The emergence of precision medicine may enable tailored interventions based on individual patient profiles, including genetic, biomarker, imaging, and clinical data. Advanced hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical circulatory support devices with smaller profiles and higher flow, and targeted pharmacologic therapies have expanded the therapeutic possibilities in CS. However, integrating these novel approaches into clinical practice requires careful alignment with evidence-based medicine. Balancing innovation with robust clinical evidence is crucial. Many technologies enter the clinical sphere before comprehensive trials confirm their benefit, creating potential risks in vulnerable CS patients. Precision medicine must therefore be grounded on rigorous data from randomized-controlled trials, registries, and meta-analyses to ensure safety and efficacy. Collaborative efforts, including large-scale data sharing and international research networks, are essential to bridge the gap between innovation and evidence. The goal is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all model toward a more nuanced, patient-centered approach while maintaining scientific rigor.

### Cardiogenic shock in older adults: a focus on age-associated risks and approach to management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^ac55448e]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock continues to portend poor outcomes, conferring short-term mortality rates of 30% to 50% despite recent scientific advances. Age is a nonmodifiable risk factor for mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock and is often considered in the decision-making process for eligibility for various therapies. Older adults have been largely excluded from analyses of therapeutic options in patients with cardiogenic shock. As a result, despite the association of advanced age with worse outcomes, focused strategies in the assessment and management of cardiogenic shock in this high-risk and growing population are lacking. Individual programs oftentimes develop upper age limits for various interventional strategies for their patients, including heart transplantation and durable left ventricular assist devices. However, age as a lone parameter should not be used to guide individual patient management decisions in cardiogenic shock. In the assessment of risk in older adults with cardiogenic shock, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is central to developing best practices. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we aim to summarize our contemporary understanding of the epidemiology, risk assessment, and in-hospital approach to management of cardiogenic shock, with a unique focus on older adults.

### Cardiogenic shock: evolving definitions and future directions in management [^72362499]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex and highly morbid entity conceptualised as a vicious cycle of injury, cardiac and systemic decompensation, and further injury and decompensation. The pathophysiology of CS is incompletely understood but limited clinical trial experience suggests that early and robust support of the failing heart to allow for restoration of systemic homoeostasis appears critical for survival. We review the pathophysiology, clinical features and trial data to construct a contemporary model of CS as a systemic process characterised with maladaptive compensatory mechanisms requiring prompt and appropriately tailored medical and mechanical support for optimal outcomes. We conclude with an algorithmic approach to acute CS incorporating clinical and haemodynamic data to match the patient's cardiac and systemic needs as a template for contemporary management.

### Tailored therapy in cardiogenic shock: case-based management choices [^f0d2d58e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a complex, multisystem disorder precipitated by hypoperfusion from cardiac dysfunction. Our current approach to defining and treating CS encompasses all patients under 1 umbrella regardless of phenotype. This has created challenges for clinical trials and patient care owing to the heterogeneity of the patient population with CS. The Society of Coronary Angiography and Interventions shock classification has created a universal language for CS that has been rapidly adopted by researchers and clinicians. Its latest iteration established the 3-axis model incorporating shock severity, risk modifiers, and phenotypes. Phenotypes of CS have unique hemodynamic profiles that require nuanced adjustment approaches. In this study, we discuss representative cases including acute myocardial infarction, acute-on-chronic heart failure, fulminant myocarditis, and right ventricular failure. For each phenotype, specific hemodynamic parameters may help confirm appropriate diagnosis and direct to therapeutic targets signaling stability and recovery. The underlying pathophysiology of each phenotype can also help predict the extent of stabilization with pharmacologic interventions or the need to escalate to mechanical circulatory support. In conclusion, this tailored approach to CS, rather than a 1-size-fits-all approach, could help improve outcomes.

Future directions and conclusions for women with cardiogenic shock (CS) prioritize early identification, early referral for mechanical circulatory support, standardized protocols, and shock teams to improve outcomes. Early identification of CS and its etiology and early referral for mechanical circulatory support are important to improving mortality outcomes in CS. Lastly, standardization of shock treatment protocols can also help improve early diagnosis and recognition of shock in women and reduce sex-based disparities. Established shock teams and treatment algorithms have demonstrated faster and more appropriate treatments for patients with CS and improvements in survival in multiple centers.

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^b3f4f839]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) consensus — abstract overview: Despite improved therapies for cardiogenic shock (CS), short-term mortality remains as high as 50%. Research has recently focused on CS related to acute myocardial infarction, although HF-CS accounts for > 50% of CS cases. The abstract notes a paucity of high-quality evidence supporting standardized clinical practices for HF-CS and an unmet need for disease-specific diagnostic and risk-stratification strategies upon admission to guide therapy and resource allocation. An International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus conference was organized to better define, diagnose, and manage HF-CS, and there were 54 participants.

### Management of refractory cardiogenic shock [^39a113fb]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs in response to reduced cardiac output in the presence of adequate intravascular volume and results in tissue hypoxia. Cardiogenic shock has several underlying aetiologies, with the most common being acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Refractory cardiogenic shock presents as persistent tissue hypoperfusion despite administration of adequate doses of two vasoactive medications and treatment of the underlying aetiology. Investigators of the SHOCK trial reported a long-term mortality benefit of emergency revascularization for shock complicating AMI. Since the publication of the SHOCK trial and subsequent guideline recommendations, the increase in community-based use of percutaneous coronary intervention for this condition has resulted in a significant decline in mortality. Despite these successes in the past 15 years, mortality still remains exceptionally high, particularly in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology and pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock and summarize the data on the available therapeutics and their limitations. Although new mechanical circulatory support devices have been shown to improve haemodynamic variables in patients with shock complicating AMI, they did not improve clinical outcomes and are associated with high costs and complications.

### Optimized risk score to predict mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock in the cardiac intensive care unit [^5ab03434]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Mortality for cardiogenic shock remains high, with fewer than 70% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. Randomized trials have largely been unsuccessful in identifying strategies to improve mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock, aside from culprit‐vessel revascularization for myocardial infarction (MI). Nevertheless, a spectrum of treatment options exists, ranging from emergent mechanical circulatory support to palliation. The variation in outcomes for patients with cardiogenic shock may partly stem from differences in illness severity. In this setting, tools to stratify patients with cardiogenic shock can provide important prognostic information and guide the appropriate triage and selection of therapies.

The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) Shock Stage classification system was developed to indicate cardiogenic shock severitybut represents only 1 component of cardiogenic shock mortality risk prediction and must be used in concert with tools to account for risk modifiers in cardiogenic shock evaluation and prognostication. Generic models for predicting mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) are ill suited to predicting mortality in the cardiogenic shock population, as they were developed using large heterogeneous ICU patient populations. Conversely, models to predict mortality specifically for patients with cardiogenic shock are derived from small observational or clinical trial data sets with strict exclusion criteria, which limit their accuracy and generalizability.,

To address this knowledge gap, we developed and validated a specialized risk score to predict mortality among patients with cardiogenic shock in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). We leveraged 2 large real‐world databases and a machine learning method developed to fit simple additive risk scores. Such a risk score can quickly be calculated at the bedside and inform shared decision‐making regarding treatment options for critically ill patients.

### Sex differences in treatments and outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and epidemiological meta-analysis [^bddd42b0]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Less aggressive treatment of women with cardiogenic shock may lead to higher mortality. Women with AMI-cardiogenic shock have been shown to be less likely to receive revascularisation. The data herein demonstrate that women with all-cause cardiogenic shock are less likely to receive MCS. Clinicians may be less likely to pursue MCS in women with cardiogenic shock due to their baseline differences including older age, comorbid disease and increased frailty. In some jurisdictions, women with cardiogenic shock are more often from more deprived socioeconomic groups, which may consciously or unconsciously affect decision-making.

The evidence base for treatment of cardiogenic shock derives almost entirely from men: the proportion of women enrolled in the eight included RCTs (Table 2) ranges from 19 to 35%. In the three trials to date which have reported a survival benefit from an intervention in AMI-related cardiogenic shock, the benefit was seen only in the male patients. In DANGER-SHOCK, the relative risk for mortality with a pVAD was 1.01 (0.58–1.79) in women compared to 0.67 (0.47–0.93) for men; in CULPRIT-SHOCK the relative risk for mortality with culprit vs. complete revascularisation in women was 1.02 (0.77–1.35) compared to 0.76 (0.64–0.91) in men. The SHOCK trial (revascularisation vs. medical therapy) was not included in our analysis as sex-specific mortality data was unavailable, but also reported a statistically significant benefit for revascularisation in men but no significant benefit in women with a relative risk > 1.

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^cdbe0609]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure–related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) introduction and ISHLT consensus scope state that cardiogenic shock (CS) presents a significant challenge with no consensus on best practices, is most commonly associated with decompensated heart failure (HF-CS) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS), and, despite improved therapies, mortality remains as high as 50%. Data from American and European multicenter registries highlight a rising prevalence of HF-CS, and in the absence of randomized controlled trials enrolling HF-CS patients there are significant gaps in risk assessment, use of temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) device therapies, and treatment goals. To ascertain current practices, an International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus conference took place on April 26, 2022, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, attended by 54 participants from 42 centers in 11 countries. Participants were organized into three task forces: "Focus on Centers: Models of CS care", "Focus on Patients: Presentations in HF-CS", and "Focus on Management: Strategies in HF-CS management". Throughout the document, CS refers specifically to HF-CS.

### Post-myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock is a systemic illness in need of systemic treatment: is therapeutic hypothermia one possibility? [^33a7f497]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Early observations of cardiogenic shock as a systemic clinical syndrome were first described in 1942. Today, cardiogenic shock remains the leading cause of death among patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI). Mortality rates in post-MI cardiogenic shock approach 50% despite rapid revascularization, optimal medical care, and use of mechanical support. New therapeutic strategies with global systemic effects may offer advances in treatment and outcome in post-MI cardiogenic shock. Therapeutic hypothermia for post-MI cardiogenic shock has multiple potentially beneficial physiologic effects, including the potential to improve post-ischemic cardiac function and hemodynamics, decrease myocardial damage, and reduce end-organ injury from prolonged hypoperfusion. Available data in animal models of post-MI cardiogenic shock and ischemia/reperfusion injury and small case series of human patients with cardiogenic shock suggest its promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiogenic shock in the post-MI setting. We hypothesize that systemic therapeutic hypothermia could decrease morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients with cardiogenic shock and warrants study a new treatment that could be widely available at hospitals worldwide.

Introduction — cardiogenic shock (CS) is described as a complex, heterogenous, multifactorial syndrome in which a cardiac disorder results in insufficient cardiac output culminating in end-organ hypoperfusion. CS is one of the most common causes of admission to contemporary cardiac intensive care units and remains a highly morbid and lethal complication, with short-term mortality ranging from 30% to 40% and 1-year mortality approaching or exceeding 50%. CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) has been the most extensively studied form of CS in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^fb8c9b97]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the understanding, risk-stratification, and treatment of cardiogenic shock (CS). Despite improved pharmacologic and device-based therapies for CS, short-term mortality remains as high as 50%. Most recent efforts in research have focused on CS related to acute myocardial infarction, even though heart failure related CS (HF-CS) accounts for > 50% of CS cases. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support standardized clinical practices in approach to HF-CS. In addition, there is an unmet need to identify disease-specific diagnostic and risk-stratification strategies upon admission, which might ultimately guide the choice of therapies, and thereby improve outcomes and optimize resource allocation. The heterogeneity in defining CS, patient phenotypes, treatment goals and therapies has resulted in difficulty comparing published reports and standardized treatment algorithms. An International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus conference was organized to better define, diagnose, and manage HF-CS. There were 54 participants (advanced heart failure and interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, critical care cardiologists, intensivists, pharmacists, and allied health professionals), with vast clinical and published experience in CS, representing 42 centers worldwide. State-of-the-art HF-CS presentations occurred with subsequent breakout sessions planned in an attempt to reach consensus on various issues, including but not limited to models of CS care delivery, patient presentations in HF-CS, and strategies in HF-CS management. This consensus report summarizes the contemporary literature review on HF-CS presented in the first half of the conference (part 1), while the accompanying document (part 2) covers the breakout sessions where the previously agreed upon clinical issues were discussed with an aim to get to a consensus.

### Cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction: a review [^77dcbf3f]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiogenic shock affects between 40 000 and 50 000 people in the US per year and is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality following acute myocardial infarction.

Observations

Thirty-day mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction is approximately 40%, and 1-year mortality approaches 50%. Immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery remains the only treatment for cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction supported by randomized clinical trials. The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Strategies with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome of 30-day death or kidney replacement therapy; 158 of 344 patients (45.9%) in the culprit lesion revascularization-only group compared with 189 of 341 patients (55.4%) in the multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention group (relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71–0.96]; P = 0.01). Despite a lack of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices are frequently used to manage cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cardiogenic shock occurs in up to 10% of patients immediately following acute myocardial infarction and is associated with mortality rates of nearly 40% at 30 days and 50% at 1 year. Current evidence and clinical practice guidelines support immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery as the primary therapy for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) in cardiogenic shock — Randomized controlled trials have primarily focused on STEMI-CS and have been limited by sample size, study design, patient selection, timing, and other key limitations; few head-to-head randomized comparisons exist between devices, and potential therapeutic benefits must be weighed against bleeding, vascular, neurological, infectious, and other complications; routine use of tMCS in all CS patients is strongly discouraged.

### Temporary circulatory support for cardiogenic shock [^81438b7e]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Cardiogenic shock can occur due to acute ischaemic or non-ischaemic cardiac events, or from progression of long-standing underlying heart disease. When addressing the cause of underlying disease, the management of cardiogenic shock consists of vasopressors and inotropes; however, these agents can increase myocardial oxygen consumption, impair tissue perfusion, and are frequently ineffective. An alternative approach is to temporarily augment cardiac output using mechanical devices. The use of these devices-known as temporary circulatory support systems-has increased substantially in recent years, despite being expensive, resource intensive, associated with major complications, and lacking high-quality evidence to support their use. This Review summarises the physiological basis underlying the use of temporary circulatory support for cardiogenic shock, reviews the evidence informing indications and contraindications, addresses ethical considerations, and highlights the need for further research.

### Impact of center volume on outcomes in myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock: a CULPRIT-SHOCK substudy [^74125b08]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, the following conclusions can be drawn from this study: Reperfusion success and 1‐year outcomes did not differ across the spectrum of experience or center volume. This being said, most adjunctive therapies differed depending on center volume, including antithrombotic therapy, renal replacement, and even the use of mechanical support. The lack of evidence‐based treatment protocols might potentially explain the high mortality in the overall cardiogenic shock population and in this study. Additionally, the treatment heterogeneity underscores the urgent need for standardized protocols and accelerated research to answer the open questions (eg, what are the best adjunctive treatments in cardiogenic shock?). In the future, dedicated treatment protocols might help to improve outcomes in these patients (eg, via guiding the use of mechanical circulatory support towards patients who might benefit the most). In this regard, 2 recent studies have already reported encouraging results for standardized team‐based care for cardiogenic shock. Additionally, the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative reported promising results based on an algorithm focusing on left ventricular unloading for the treatment of cardiogenic shock, indicating that a more targeted application of these devices could potentially improve survival of affected patients.

Nevertheless, our study should not be interpreted as an opportunity to further decentralize the care for patients with cardiogenic shock, because all participating centers in this study had 24/7 availability for coronary angiography/intervention, access to level 3 intensive care unit, which is a minimum requirement as per current guidelines, but also selected based on scientific interest and level of care by the steering committee. Hence, all participating centers are considered Level 1 Cardiogenic Shock Care Centers, which provide the needed expertise and treatment options for this patient population, and thus mainly differ in overall case volume, but not in individual expertise.

Rather, this study should be understood as a reminder that more work is needed in this field, and a call for a harmonization of the therapeutic approach to myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.

### Cardiogenic shock: evolving definitions and future directions in management [^ec451c9e]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Though there have been significant advances in reperfusion therapy and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, mortality among patients presenting with acute cardiogenic shock (CS) remain obstinately high, ranging from 25% to 50%. In a recent large cohort of 21 210 patients in London with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), CS was observed in 8.9% of patients with the incidence increasing over time and high mortality of 45%–70%. Significant effort has been dedicated to the development of management guidelines and treatment algorithms to improve survival from this highly lethal condition. Despite increasing awareness, a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data and wide practice variation exists. Though the exact pathophysiology of this multifactorial, haemodynamically diverse population remains poorly understood, early recognition and intervention to interrupt the devastating 'cardiogenic shock spiral' are critical to survival.

The generally accepted definition of CS is a state in which ineffective cardiac output (CO) due to a primary cardiac dysfunction results in inadequate end-organ perfusion. Current CS-defining criteria used in clinical trials and guidelines are varied, and recommendations are largely based on data from patients with CS due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Considerably less is understood regarding the identification and outcomes in the non-ACS population, particularly acute decompensation in patients with underlying congestive heart failure–the so-called, 'acute-on-chronic' CS. Improved understanding of the pathophysiological process and identification of specific criteria for classification in this widely heterogeneous population is critical for early identification and appropriate management of patients with CS.

### Medical therapy of cardiogenic shock: contemporary use of inotropes and vasopressors [^158f407d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is a primary cardiac disorder that results in both clinical and biochemical evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and can lead to multi-organ failure and death depending on its severity. Inadequate cardiac contractility or cardiac power secondary to acute myocardial infarction remains the most frequent cause of cardiogenic shock, although its contribution has declined over the past two decades, compared with other causes. Despite some advances in cardiogenic shock management, this clinical syndrome is still burdened by an extremely high mortality. Its management is based on immediate stabilization of haemodynamic parameters so that further treatment, including mechanical circulatory support and transfer to specialized tertiary care centres, can be accomplished. With these aims, medical therapy, consisting mainly of inotropic drugs and vasopressors, still has a major role. The purpose of this article is to review current evidence on the use of these medications in patients with cardiogenic shock and discuss specific clinical settings with indications to their use.

### Need for a cardiogenic shock team collaborative-promoting a team-based model of care to improve outcomes and identify best practices [^6ce3e961]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of cardiogenic shock (CS) is complicated. Despite innovations in pharmacologic and mechanical circulatory support, no single therapy introduced over the past several decades has resulted in a demonstrable improvement in patient survival. As a result, CS continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. More recently, however, it has been proposed that methods for leveraging the collective cognitive and procedural proficiencies of a multidisciplinary team of providers may be helpful; in fact, the concept of a collaborative cardiogenic "shock team" is now endorsed by the American Heart Association and has been successfully implemented at a number of high‐volume clinical centers. At the same time, there is a slowly maturing evidence base that has suggested that CS teams may improve patient outcomes; however, there are currently no established recommendations available to guide the composition, assembly, or employment of such teams. On conducting an informal 2023 survey of critical care cardiology physicians (representing leadership from 25 institutions in the United States) committed to the idea of the shock team, considerable heterogeneity of opinion and practice emerged. Notably, there were numerous differences with regard to staffing, structure, and care processes, along with great variation in team membership, methods of activation, and resource needs. Although several maturing CS registries are beginning to inform care — most with a particular focus on therapeutic strategies for circulatory support — none of these currently focus on the role of the shock team, the potential value of multidisciplinary management, provider education, or process improvement.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^88136257]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Research priorities in mixed shock

Patients with mixed shock continue to have high morbidity and mortality, and many important scientific questions must be addressed given their unmet clinical needs (Table 2). Novel scientific approaches and emergence of newer therapies represent important strategies to mitigate the lethal burden of mixed shock. The "host response" to myocardial injury and end-organ failure in CS and mixed shock may be maladaptive and deleterious, and potential targets for therapy to limit these harmful mechanisms need to be identified.

Table 2
Research Priorities in Mixed Shock

Clear diagnostic criteria are needed to enable generation of better epidemiological data to understand the true disease burden, for example, for SICM or mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock. Research priorities should include a standardized definition for mixed shock for both clinical trials and contemporary practice. Consensus definitions for CS and septic shock fail to precisely define mixed shock, which limits both registry-based research endeavors and the conduct and reporting of clinical trials. Perhaps an expert panel approach convening a multi-stakeholder collaboration including clinicians, investigators, industry representatives, regulators, and payers may help to generate consensus definitions for safety and outcomes in mixed shock to promote clarity and consistency in future research, analogous to the Shock Academic Research Consortium statement on CS.

### Cardiac shock care centers: JACC review topic of the week [^2164aa55]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite advances over the past decade, the incidence of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction has increased, with an unchanged mortality near 50%. Recent trials have not clarified the best strategies in treatment. While dedicated cardiac shock centers are being established, there are no standardized agreements on the utilization of mechanical circulatory support and the timeliness of percutaneous coronary intervention strategies. In some centers and prospective registries, outcomes after placement of advanced mechanical circulatory support prior to reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention have been encouraging with improved survival. Here, we suggest systems of care with a treatment pathway for patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.

### Cardiogenic shock a Quarter Century Later: a dire outcome barely changed [^28385062]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Almost a quarter of a century after the SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronary Arteries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial showed an absolute 13% reduction from 63.1% to 50.3% in 6-month mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS)outcomes of these critically ill patients and therapies in CS have changed little. Furthermore, by far the majority of studies, randomized controlled trials or observational studies, have focused primarily on CS in the context ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and even in those that included patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), little has been written about characteristics and outcomes specific to this latter group of high-risk patients.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Sinha et alprovide the most contemporary window into the treatment of patients with CS complicating AMI in the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group (CSWG) registry, a collaboration of 17 community and university hospitals in the United States.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^31648440]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This state-of-the-art review describes the potential etiologies, pathophysiology, and management of mixed shock in the context of a proposed novel classification system. Cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock occurs when cardiogenic shock is complicated by inappropriate vasodilation, impairing compensatory mechanisms, and contributing to worsening shock. Vasodilatory-cardiogenic shock occurs when vasodilatory shock is complicated by myocardial dysfunction, resulting in low cardiac output. Primary mixed shock occurs when a systemic insult triggers both myocardial dysfunction and vasoplegia. Regardless of the etiology of mixed shock, the hemodynamic profile can be similar, and outcomes tend to be poor. Identification and treatment of both the initial and complicating disease processes is essential along with invasive hemodynamic monitoring given the evolving nature of mixed shock states. Hemodynamic support typically involves a combination of inotropes and vasopressors, with few data available to guide the use of mechanical circulatory support. Consensus definitions and novel treatment strategies are needed for this dangerous condition.

### Sex differences in treatments and outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and epidemiological meta-analysis [^79e2e936]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review examining sex differences in outcome in patients with cardiogenic shock. Strengths of this study include geographically representative data, a large sample size and well-defined outcome measures (in-hospital mortality and use of MCS). The observed effect size remained present after exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias, and we undertook a rigorous process to limit inclusion of multiple publications from the same patient dataset. Our key findings are that, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, female patients with cardiogenic shock were 10% more likely to die than male patients, and 30% less likely to receive MCS. The observed difference in mortality was mirrored in sub-group analyses of AMI-cardiogenic shock and HF-cardiogenic shock.

There are multiple potential explanations for our findings, which include: (1) persistent confounding from variables not adjusted for in studies reporting adjusted analysis; (2) differences in cardiogenic shock aetiology and pathophysiology between men and women; (3) sex-related healthcare behaviours and/or systemic bias from clinicians leading to women presenting at a more advanced stage of cardiogenic shock; (4) differential therapeutic effects causing women to derive less benefit from treatments than men; and (5) implicit bias from treating healthcare professionals leading to less aggressive treatment of cardiogenic shock in women.

Included studies reported that women who develop cardiogenic shock are older and have more comorbidities. Men with AMI-cardiogenic shock are more likely to have obstructive coronary disease, whereas women are more likely to have non-obstructive coronary arteries with other comorbidities, which may predispose them to poorer outcomes. Despite men representing most patients with AMI-cardiogenic shock, women have a higher risk of developing cardiogenic shock post-AMI compared to men. Women with obstructed coronary arteries may have more diffuse disease less amenable to angiographic intervention. Given that successful revascularisation of the culprit vessel(s) is strongly associated with survival in AMI-cardiogenic shock, this may contribute to its increased incidence and mortality in women. Sex differences in heart failure aetiology and in cardiac function have also been described in patients with chronic heart failure.

Evidence gaps in addressing barriers to care for women with cardiogenic shock (CS) include enrollment, device design, and classification validation. Improve enrollment in CS trials by setting a prespecified quota of women in ongoing and future CS clinical trials to determine risks and benefits of novel treatments in women. Device innovation for smaller profile devices and new approaches to mitigate vascular complications should be a priority. Validation of SCAI SHOCK classification in women is necessity.

### Contemporary management of cardiogenic shock: a RAND appropriateness panel approach [^58b87117]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice in cardiogenic shock is guided by expert opinion in guidelines and scientific statements from professional societies with limited high quality randomized trial data to inform optimal patient management. An international panel conducted a modified Delphi process with the intent of identifying aspects of cardiogenic shock care where there was uncertainty regarding optimal patient management.

Methods

An 18-person multidisciplinary panel comprising international experts was convened. A modified RAND/University of California Los Angeles appropriateness methodology was used. A survey comprising 70 statements was completed. Participants anonymously rated the appropriateness of each statement on a scale of 1 to 9: 1 to 3 inappropriate, 4 to 6 uncertain, and 7 to 9 appropriate. A summary of the results was discussed as a group, and the survey was iterated and completed again before final analysis.

Results

There was broad alignment with current international guidelines and consensus statements. Overall, 44 statements were rated as appropriate, 19 as uncertain, and 7 as inappropriate. There was no disagreement with a disagreement index < 1 for all statements. Routine fluid administration was deemed to be inappropriate. Areas of uncertainty focused panel on pre-PCI interventions, the use of right heart catheterization to guide management, routine use of left ventricular unloading strategies, and markers of futility when considering escalation to mechanical circulatory support.

Conclusions

While there was broad alignment with current guidance, an expert panel found several aspects of care where there was clinical equipoise, further highlighting the need for randomized controlled trials to better guide patient management and decision making in cardiogenic shock.

Heart failure–cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) care principles — HF-CS remains a challenging and heterogenous syndrome, and with a dearth of high-quality published data, current best practice reflects broad principles of care that may optimize patient outcomes independent of resource availability across all healthcare systems. Central to these principles are the role of team-based care and decision making; utilizing a battery of serial clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data to inform and revise clinical decision making, particularly around escalation to tMCS; the role of risk-stratification to inform the expediency of intervention and escalation/de-escalation; and the importance of a nuanced, patient- and institution-specific strategy, maximizing potential gains from tMCS while minimizing complications. Ongoing current and forthcoming investigation in the HF-CS patient population are enthusiastically anticipated to better inform future practice.

### State of shock: contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^941157bc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the underlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory support recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over 90% of patients receiving at least 1 vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.

A Stepwise Approach to Vasoactive Therapy in Cardiogenic Shock

Presented in Figure 4 is a proposed stepwise approach for the use of vasoactive agents in CS. In the initial phase of therapy, we suggest that patients should be stratified into 2 phenotypes, those with hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, MAP ≤ 65 mm Hg, or > 30‐mm Hg reduction in MAP from baseline with evidence of hypoperfusion) or low cardiac output (determined clinically, biochemically, or through an invasive hemodynamic assessment) and preserved blood pressure. The algorithm advocates for the initial correction of hypotension, followed by the treatment of the low cardiac output state with the use of inodilator therapy. The timing and role for the use of MCS in this clinical situation remains less certain and is outside the scope of this review. However, persistent severe CS should prompt clinician consideration for MCS therapy at any stage of the proposed treatment pathway. This strategy leverages the emerging data supporting the use of norepinephrine as a first‐line therapy, while emphasizing the need for ongoing and repeated assessment throughout the treatment journey to tailor therapy based on the current prevailing hemodynamic status.

We have outlined the many challenges associated with building and growing shock teams and have described several institutional success stories, albeit with important lessons learned along the way. Additionally, the PERT Consortium serves as a noble model for the creation of a similar program focused on the single clinical entity of CS. In order to improve outcomes for these patients within the complex and varied contemporary clinical landscape, we believe that it will be important to put together a shock team collaborative to identify and disseminate best practice principles for multidisciplinary care.

### Nonischemic causes of cardiogenic shock [^908cb1d2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although cardiogenic shock is uncommon in the emergency department, it is associated with high mortality. Most cardiogenic shock is caused by ischemia, but nonischemic etiologies are essential to recognize. Clinicians should optimize preload, contractility, and afterload. Volume-responsive patients should be resuscitated in small aliquots, although some patients may require diuresis to improve cardiac output. Vasopressors are important to restore end-organ perfusion, and inotropes improve contractility. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation impact hemodynamics, which, depending on volume status, may be beneficial or deleterious. Knowing indications for mechanical circulatory support is important for timely consultation or transfer as indicated.

### Scrutinizing mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: have we jumped the gun? [^b02a7318]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing therapeutic options and disposable resources, cardiogenic shock (CS) remains a formidable condition with high mortality. Today, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and microaxial flow devices (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, USA) are established forms of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in CS, with increasing application over the years. Despite this trend, incorporation into current ESC (Class IIa, evidence C) and AHA/ACC (Class IIa, evidence B-NR) guidelines is based nearly exclusively on observational results. Despite these recommendations and increasing application, current evidence from randomized controlled trials has not provided clear mortality benefit. Thus, reflection on current evidence is hereby justified.

### A review of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction… [^6fe29fe4]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Cardiogenic shock affects between 40 000 and 50 000 people in the US per year and is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality following acute myocardial infarction. Observations. Thirty-day mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction is approximately 40%, and 1-year mortality approaches 50%. Immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery remains the only treatment for cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction supported by randomized clinical trials. The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Strategies with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiogenic Shock clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome of 30-day death or kidney replacement therapy; 158 of 344 patients in the culprit lesion revascularization–only group compared with 189 of 341 patients in the multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention group. Despite a lack of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices are frequently used to manage cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. Conclusions and Relevance Cardiogenic shock occurs in up to 10% of patients immediately following acute myocardial infarction and is associated with mortality rates of nearly 40% at 30 days and 50% at 1 year. Current evidence and clinical practice guidelines support immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery as the primary therapy for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.

### Inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies for the treatment of cardiogenic shock or low cardiac output syndrome [^b7ba3f82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) and low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) as complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF) or cardiac surgery are life-threatening conditions. While there is a broad body of evidence for the treatment of people with acute coronary syndrome under stable haemodynamic conditions, the treatment strategies for people who become haemodynamically unstable or develop CS remain less clear. We have therefore summarised here the evidence on the treatment of people with CS or LCOS with different inotropic agents and vasodilative drugs. This is the first update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess efficacy and safety of cardiac care with positive inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies in people with CS or LCOS due to AMI, HF or cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CPCI-S Web of Science in June 2017. We also searched four registers of ongoing trials and scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with myocardial infarction, heart failure or cardiac surgery complicated by cardiogenic shock or LCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 13 eligible studies with 2001 participants (mean or median age range 58 to 73 years) and two ongoing studies. We categorised studies into eight comparisons, all against cardiac care and additional other active drugs or placebo. These comparisons investigated the efficacy of levosimendan versus dobutamine, enoximone or placebo, epinephrine versus norepinephrine-dobutamine, amrinone versus dobutamine, dopexamine versus dopamine, enoximone versus dopamine and nitric oxide versus placebo. All trials were published in peer-reviewed journals, and analysis was done by the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Twelve of 13 trials were small with few included participants. Acknowledgement of funding by the pharmaceutical industry or missing conflict of interest statements emerged in five of 13 trials. In general, confidence in the results of analysed studies was reduced due to serious study limitations, very serious imprecision or indirectness. Domains of concern, which show a high risk of more than 50%, include performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and bias affecting the quality of evidence on adverse events. Levosimendan may reduce short-term mortality compared to a therapy with dobutamine (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95; 6 studies; 1776 participants; low-quality evidence; NNT: 16 (patients with moderate risk), NNT: 5 (patients with CS)). This initial short-term survival benefit with levosimendan vs. dobutamine is not confirmed on long-term follow up. There is uncertainty (due to lack of statistical power) as to the effect of levosimendan compared to therapy with placebo (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.94; 2 studies; 55 participants, very low-quality evidence) or enoximone (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.14; 1 study; 32 participants, very low-quality evidence). All comparisons comparing other positive inotropic, inodilative or vasodilative drugs presented uncertainty on their effect on short-term mortality with very low-quality evidence and based on only one RCT. These single studies compared epinephrine with norepinephrine-dobutamine (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.77; 30 participants), amrinone with dobutamine (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.85; 30 participants), dopexamine with dopamine (no in-hospital deaths from 70 participants), enoximone with dobutamine (two deaths from 40 participants) and nitric oxide with placebo (one death from three participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Apart from low quality of evidence data suggesting a short-term mortality benefit of levosimendan compared with dobutamine, at present there are no robust and convincing data to support a distinct inotropic or vasodilator drug-based therapy as a superior solution to reduce mortality in haemodynamically unstable people with cardiogenic shock or LCOS. Considering the limited evidence derived from the present data due to a generally high risk of bias and imprecision, it should be emphasised that there remains a great need for large, well-designed randomised trials on this topic to close the gap between daily practice in critical care medicine and the available evidence. It seems to be useful to apply the concept of 'early goal-directed therapy' in cardiogenic shock and LCOS with early haemodynamic stabilisation within predefined timelines. Future clinical trials should therefore investigate whether such a therapeutic concept would influence survival rates much more than looking for the 'best' drug for haemodynamic support.

### Ten-year trends in the incidence and treatment of cardiogenic shock [^7a53e152]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies describe recent changes in the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock.

Objective

To examine temporal trends in the incidence, therapeutic management, and mortality rates of patients with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and cardiogenic shock, and to assess associations of therapeutic management with death and cardiogenic shock developing during hospitalization.

Design

Analysis of registry data collected among patients admitted to hospitals between 1997 and 2006.

Setting

70 of the 106 acute cardiac care hospitals in Switzerland.

Patients

23 696 adults with ACS enrolled in the AMIS (Acute Myocardial Infarction in Switzerland) Plus Registry.

Measurements

Cardiogenic shock incidence; treatment, including rates of percutaneous coronary intervention; and in-hospital mortality rates.

Results

Rates of overall cardiogenic shock (8.3% of patients with ACS) and cardiogenic shock developing during hospitalization (6.0% of patients with ACS and 71.5% of patients with cardiogenic shock) decreased during the past decade (P < 0.001 for temporal trend), whereas rates of cardiogenic shock on admission remained constant (2.3% of patients with ACS and 28.5% of patients with cardiogenic shock). Rates of percutaneous coronary intervention increased among patients with cardiogenic shock (7.6% to 65.9%; P = 0.010), whereas in-hospital mortality decreased (62.8% to 47.7%; P = 0.010). Percutaneous coronary intervention was independently associated with lower risk for both in-hospital mortality in all patients with ACS (odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.73]; P = 0.001) and cardiogenic shock development during hospitalization in patients with ACS but without cardiogenic shock on admission (odds ratio, 0.59 [CI, 0.39 to 0.89]; P = 0.012).

Limitations

There was no central review of cardiogenic shock diagnoses, and follow-up duration was confined to the hospital stay. Unmeasured or inaccurately measured characteristics may have confounded observed associations of treatment with outcomes.

Conclusion

Over the past decade, rates of cardiogenic shock developing during hospitalization and in-hospital mortality decreased among patients with ACS. Increased percutaneous coronary intervention rates were associated with decreased mortality among patients with cardiogenic shock and with decreased development of cardiogenic shock during hospitalization.

Cardiogenic shock classification and phenotyping — use of SCAI staging, etiologic categories, monitoring, and escalation. "CS should be classified using the SCAI stage of CS". The phenotype framework "distinguishes between the following etiologies: AMI-CS; HF-CS; postcardiotomy CS; and secondary CS (due to arrhythmias, valvular disease, pericardial disease, or other etiologies)". "AMI-CS can be further subcategorized by whether STEMI vs non-STEMI is present; moreover, HF-CS can be subclassified by de novo HF-CS vs acute-on-chronic HF-CS". After diagnosis and severity are established, "invasive monitoring or diagnostic procedures such as an arterial line and a pulmonary artery catheter may be used to continuously monitor hemodynamics to aid in selection of and response to treatment strategies to address congestion and perfusion", and "transfer to a higher level of care (including a different institution) may be necessary for further management after initial stabilization".

Pediatric cardiogenic shock — management recommendations and clinical features: For infants and children with cardiogenic shock, early expert consultation is recommended (COR 1, LOE C-EO), and for infants and children with cardiogenic shock, it may be reasonable to use epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, or milrinone as an inotropic infusion (COR 2b, LOE C-EO). Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, resulting in decreased cardiac output and inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, is relatively rare in children compared to other forms of shock but is associated with high rates of mortality, and initial treatment is focused on improving oxygen delivery, minimizing oxygen consumption, and restoring cardiac function through administration of vasoactive medications; it can be difficult to diagnose early and can occur with other forms of shock simultaneously, so a high index of suspicion is warranted; these recommendations have not been updated for this edition of the Guidelines.

SCAI cardiogenic shock classification — stage definitions A–E organize patients into five stages with explicit clinical thresholds and escalation criteria. Stage A "At risk" for cardiogenic shock (CS) describes a patient who is not experiencing signs or symptoms of CS but is at risk for its development. Stage B "Beginning" (pre-shock/compensated) involves relative hypotension or tachycardia without hypoperfusion, with hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg OR mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg or > 30 mmHg drop from baseline. Stage C "Classic" CS has hypoperfusion requiring initial interventions beyond volume resuscitation and typically presents with mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) ≤ 60 mmHg or systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Stage D "Deteriorating" or "Doom" CS is failure to stabilize despite intensive initial efforts; classification requires appropriate treatment/medical stabilization and at least 30 minutes have elapsed without resolution of hypotension or end-organ hypoperfusion, with escalation defined as increasing the number or intensity of intravenous therapies or adding mechanical circulatory support. Stage E "Extremis" CS denotes circulatory collapse, frequently (but not always) in refractory cardiac arrest with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or support by multiple simultaneous acute interventions including ECMO-facilitated CPR (eCPR).

Cardiogenic shock (CS) team activation — model, observed associations, composition, and operational elements — is outlined as follows: A standardized, interdisciplinary, team-based approach to CS management has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, with single‑center protocols showing lower inhospital mortality, and a multicenter observational analysis among 10 of 24 centers with shock teams showing more frequent invasive hemodynamics, use of advanced types of MCS beyond an intra‑aortic balloon pump, and lower risk‑adjusted cardiac intensive care unit mortality. Key stakeholders have typically included critical care cardiology or general critical care in collaboration with a cardiac intensive care unit cardiologist, advanced HF and transplant cardiology, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation intensivists or perfusionist and/or palliative care specialists may be included. Common elements at Level 1 CS hospital centers include early interdisciplinary engagement, a coordinating physician for efficient patient triage, a rapid system for concurrent team activation, efficient virtual and/or bedside communication, and use of invasive hemodynamics to guide therapy selection. Depending on resources, all elements may not be readily available, additional expertise may be needed in scenarios such as electrical storm, critically ill pregnancy, or complex adult congenital heart disease physiology, and the writing committee affirms the importance and value of building and growing shock teams and frequently reviewing CS cases for patient safety and quality improvement.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) vasoactive therapy and escalation — Inodilators or vasodilators may be considered in normotensive CS, with intravenous milrinone used judiciously in worsening renal function, and chronotropes trialed in bradycardia-induced CS; since pure vasopressors such as phenylephrine can cause reflex bradycardia and reduce cardiac output, their use as a single first-line continuous intravenous medication is strongly discouraged; although there is no clear consensus on first-line vasoactive agent, the writing committee agrees that norepinephrine is a reasonable first choice for most hypotensive CS patients; Level 2 and 3 CS centers should pursue consultation and consider potential transfer to a Level 1 CS center when patients are refractory to initial pharmacological therapy for consideration of temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) and/or advanced therapies.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have used a multi-professional consensus process that systematically and quantitatively combined expert opinion with the limited available evidence to further inform contemporary management of HF-CS. The preponderance of HF-CS cases in cardiac critical care units coupled with the persisting ambiguity around optimal monitoring, management and escalation of these cases highlighted within, mandates a requirement for both prospective large-scale registries and clinical trials in patients with HF-CS to inform future clinical guidelines. Without this, there is risk that clinicians conflate observational data and guidance generated in the AMI-CS cohort, and as a result, clinical outcomes will remain static. Collaboration between heart failure cardiology, critical care cardiology and trial methodologists is crucial to design trials specific to the HF-CS cohort.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) regionalization and transfer — recommendations, triggers, and triage considerations — are specified as follows: The writing committee recommends that Level 2 and 3 CS hospital centers identify locally available resources and a dedicated CS regional center for transfer or remote consultation, while Level 1 centers should welcome consultations, accept appropriately selected transfers, and may provide remote consultation. Patients with AMI-CS who remain in refractory CS postrevascularization should almost always be transferred to a Level 1 CS hospital center. Communication with the CS regional center is also prompted by cardiac arrest with tenuous neurological status, initiation on ≥ 1 vasoactive medication, or when a tMCS device is being considered, and once CS is suspected the writing committee believes it is never too early to contact the regional center. For Level 2 and 3 centers without on‑site expertise or an established CS team, the writing committee strongly recommends early contact with the regional Level 1 CS hospital center after confirming the initial diagnosis. Key triage questions include: the SCAI Stage and Shock Academic Research Consortium classification, whether escalation of tMCS support is needed now, any absolute contraindications to escalation, whether institutional resources match anticipated needs, and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable for transfer.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^880f05dc]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Mixed shock is a hemodynamically complex, multifactorial, heterogenous syndrome involving a diverse group of etiologies ultimately resulting in a combined hemodynamic lesion associated with greater vasopressor requirements, higher severity of illness, and worse outcomes than typical shock phenotypes. The adverse effects of systemic inflammation on cardiac and vascular function commonly drive mixed shock regardless of the cause, which may be initially cardiogenic or vasodilatory before evolving to a mixed state. Due to the lack of a consensus definition, patients with mixed shock have not been extensively studied, precluding robust analyses or evidence-based recommendations from professional societies. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is important to identify and manage patients with mixed shock, who typically present with late decompensation in a patient with cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock. Rational combination vasopressor and inotrope therapy must be titrated judiciously based on hemodynamic monitoring, and MCS may be less effective for raising MAP in severely vasoplegic patients. Considering that patients with mixed shock often include the most critically ill patients with refractory shock, greater research efforts are needed to understand the role of adjunctive therapies in this high-risk population.

Transferring a patient with cardiogenic shock (CS) — center capabilities and team approach. "The acuity and complexity of CS patients require an interdisciplinary, collaborative, and standardized team-based approach to management". While many hospitals can provide acute cardiovascular care, "some can serve as CS centers (known as Level 1 CS hospital centers) being equipped with the full gamut of on-site 24/7 medical and surgical expertise, tMCS devices and "high" procedural volumes". "In many cases, such CS centers may also provide advanced HF therapies such as durable LV assist device (LVAD) and orthotopic heart transplant". "Advanced CS centers are typically concentrated in larger, urban cities, whereas most CS patients present to local, community hospitals".

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiogenic shock (CS) continues to be the leading cause of mortality in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 1 the incidence ranging between 5% and 8%. 2 Although with advances in treatment, mainly early revascularization, the overall mortality in patients presenting with AMI has markedly reduced, but still the mortality in patients presenting with AMI complicated by CS remains very high (≅50%). 1 Limited evidences exist, supporting many of the routinely used therapies in treating these patients. The purpose of the present article is to highlight and discuss the significance of CS and presently available treatment options.

### Abciximab in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary… [^bbdedc3b]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Study Overview Outcome of patients with myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock is very poor. Although early mechanical revascularization has been demonstrated superior to conservative medical treatment, mortality range remains about 45–60%. Some medical registries have showed further therapeutic benefit by administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors during PCI in patients with cardiogenic shock. However, there is no randomized study that supports this therapeutic strategy in these high risk patients. Hypothesis: GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors improve angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock. Study design: Open "pseudorandomized" multicenter, phase IV clinical trial.

Anticipated findings: The investigators anticipate to document better angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical outcome after upfront abciximab administration in comparison to standard periprocedural therapy in patients undergoing PCI for cardiogenic shock. This would be the first randomized clinical trial that could support this therapeutic strategy. Routine upfront abciximab versus standard peri-procedural therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for cardiogenic shock PRAGUE-7 Trial. Hypothesis: GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors improve angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock. Study design:

Groups: Group A
- Upfront administration of abciximab bolus followed by 12-hours abciximab infusion + standard therapy Group B
- Standard peri-procedural therapy with possibility of abciximab administration according the interventional cardiologist. Expected rate of peri-procedural abciximab administration in this group is 20% of patients.
- PCI
- will be performed immediately after coronary angiography if technically feasible. PCI will be performed at infarct related artery. Intracoronary stent
- will be implanted if possible. Type, length and size of the stent will be choose according decision of invasive cardiologist. We anticipate to document better angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical outcome after upfront abciximab administration in comparison to standard periprocedural therapy in patients undergoing PCI for cardiogenic shock. This would be the first randomized clinical trial that could support this therapeutic strategy.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) in HF-CS — current evidence, goals, and escalation principles are summarized as follows: none of these tMCS devices have been studied in large randomized controlled trials in HF-CS; the goal of tMCS is to promote ventricular unloading as well as restore systemic perfusion; tMCS selection should be based on attaining the desired cardiac index to improve perfusion when pharmacological support alone is inadequate; if the patient is undersupported with respect to cardiac index on the present device, escalation of tMCS may be warranted; if not adequately unloaded on present support, therapeutic options include increasing flow, escalating support device (eg, Impella CP to 5.5), addressing afterload (eg, LV venting for VA-ECMO), and mitigating congestion; early palliative care consultation should be considered at the time of tMCS placement; delays in initiation of tMCS in appropriate candidates may lead to multiorgan failure and death; early recognition, prompt tailored intervention, and serial reassessment may improve outcomes.

### National cardiogenic shock initiative (NCSI) [^957f4083]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock is a deadly condition with a historical in-hospital survival of only 50%. To date, the only therapy proven to benefit patients in AMICS using data from randomized control trials has been early mechanical reperfusion. Accordingly, current American and European guidelines confer a class IB indication for reperfusion therapy in the setting of AMICS. Unfortunately, little progress has been made on improving survival with subsequent therapies, including intra-aortic balloon pump counter-pulsation. This lack of progress is worrisome since the incidence of AMICS appears to be increasing. The device should provide sufficient forward cardiac flow to support vital organs in the majority of patients who present with AMICS.

Since Impella is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support device approved as safe and effective for use in AMICS, the use of the device has steadily grown. Unfortunately, there is little data available to providers as to the best practice patterns associated with the delivery and use of Impella in AMICS. Using the most up-to-date research, a treatment algorithm for AMICS was developed and subsequently implemented as a quality improvement initiative throughout southeast Michigan. Patient information was gathered by each of the sites and collected in a retrospective registry. Outcomes and results were shared during quarterly meetings and concluded with a 41-patient pilot feasibility study. This initial pilot study revealed a 76% survival to discharge, a significant improvement compared to prior historical controls. Given the promising outcomes, leaders from around the world have implemented the treatment algorithm in their local clinical practices with similar results.

The investigators have therefore launched the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative. The aim of the NCSI is to bring together experienced centers across the nation who are experts in mechanical reperfusion therapies and have a large experience with the use of mechanical circulatory support devices to systematize care in AMICS. Our goal is to dramatically decrease the duration patients remain in cardiogenic shock and attempt to decrease total usage and duration of vasopressors and ionotropic agents. The investigators aim to further demonstrate that rapid delivery of mechanical circulatory support will improve hemodynamics, reverse the spiraling neuro-hormonal cascade associated with cardiogenic shock, allowing clinicians to decrease use of vasopressors and inotropic agents and ultimately improve survival.

Cardiogenic shock — use of vasoactive medications — states that hypoperfusion can be addressed by starting intravenous vasoactive medications, including inotropes, chronotropes, inopressors, inodilators, vasodilators, and vasopressors; although commonly used, these drugs have been associated with increased adverse effects, including arrhythmias, and increased myocardial oxygen consumption, so the writing committee advises that vasoactive medications be used in CS at the lowest possible dose to support adequate perfusion and for the shortest possible duration; evidence comparisons report that a Cochrane analysis found insufficient evidence to support the superiority of a particular inotrope or vasodilating agent in CS, and the Dobutamine Compared with Milrinone (DOREMI) trial evaluating dobutamine vs milrinone in CS patients ranging from SCAI B through E found no difference with respect to the primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The outcome of cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction has not appreciably changed in the last 30years despite the development of various percutaneous mechanical circulatory support options. It is clear that there are varying degrees of cardiogenic shock but there is no robust classification scheme to categorize this disease state.

Methods

A multidisciplinary group of experts convened by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions was assembled to derive a proposed classification schema for cardiogenic shock. Representatives from cardiology (interventional, advanced heart failure, noninvasive), emergency medicine, critical care, and cardiac nursing all collaborated to develop the proposed schema.

Results

A system describing stages of cardiogenic shock from A to E was developed. Stage A is "at risk" for cardiogenic shock, stage B is "beginning" shock, stage C is "classic" cardiogenic shock, stage D is "deteriorating", and E is "extremis". The difference between stages B and C is the presence of hypoperfusion which is present in stages C and higher. Stage D implies that the initial set of interventions chosen have not restored stability and adequate perfusion despite at least 30minutes of observation and stage E is the patient in extremis, highly unstable, often with cardiovascular collapse.

Conclusion

This proposed classification system is simple, clinically applicable across the care spectrum from pre-hospital providers to intensive care staff but will require future validation studies to assess its utility and potential prognostic implications.
