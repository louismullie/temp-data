## Question

Normal estradiol levels post menopausal woman

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what constitutes normal serum estradiol levels in untreated postmenopausal women and how to interpret these values in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "normal" is defined in the postmenopausal state and whether to call it a normal range or a reference interval. Then, I should verify the most current estimates of untreated postmenopausal estradiol levels derived from high-specificity assays. Next, I will contrast these with older textbook ranges and explain why they differ. After that, I should consider how to interpret results in clinical contexts like vaginal estrogen exposure, systemic hormone therapy, and risk stratification. Finally, I need to outline practical measurement caveats and summarize actionable takeaways, ensuring I cite contemporary guidance and methodologically sound reviews throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology, because I should not jump to conclusions about what "normal" means here. The North American Menopause Society workshop concluded that "reference range" is the preferred term over "normal range" for estradiol in postmenopausal women, given the need for standardized, assay-specific intervals and the lack of a single universally accepted normal value across platforms, which means any quoted numbers must be tied to a specific analytical method and laboratory standardization [^117ED91R].

> I will now examine the best available estimates for untreated postmenopausal estradiol using high-specificity mass spectrometry–based assays, since immunoassays historically overestimate at low concentrations. Multiple analyses that pooled LC/MS or GC/MS data from baseline or placebo groups in vaginal therapy trials and assay validation studies converge on a mean around 3.1–4.9 pg/mL, with a conservative 95% reference interval of undetectable to about 10.7 pg/mL. Some validation cohorts report medians even lower, such as 2.9–3.6 pg/mL, reinforcing that true untreated levels are very low when measured with ultrasensitive methods [^116hw6zz] [^112BohK6] [^1179tcpm].

> Wait, let me verify the older textbook figures and why they differ. Traditional teaching often cited a postmenopausal estradiol ceiling of 20–30 pg/mL, but those values largely came from earlier radioimmunoassays with cross-reactivity and limited sensitivity. When I compare this with modern MS-based data, the older assays read higher by roughly an order of magnitude, which explains the discrepancy and supports the lower contemporary range I just outlined [^111rzcTG] [^113R9shJ].

> Hold on, I should verify how time since menopause and age influence these levels, because I initially thought levels might continue to fall indefinitely. Let me reconsider that. One LC/MS/MS study reported means of about 4.9 pg/mL in women less than 5 years postmenopause versus 1.3 pg/mL in those more than 5 years postmenopause, suggesting a further decline with longer postmenopausal duration, while a large community cohort of women aged 70+ found that 66% had estradiol below the detection limit, indicating that many older untreated women have effectively undetectable levels by ultrasensitive assays, which aligns with the expected trajectory of diminishing ovarian and peripheral production over time [^112BohK6] [^1136jwzZ].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results in clinical contexts, starting with low-dose vaginal estrogen. Low-dose vaginal estradiol products generally produce minimal systemic absorption, with mean posttreatment levels often remaining within the untreated postmenopausal reference interval; for example, a 10 μg vaginal tablet increased geometric mean estradiol from 3.5 to 4.3 pg/mL, and even 25 μg formulations typically yield levels in the single digits to low teens, reinforcing that systemic exposure is low when used as directed, though dose, formulation, and placement can modulate absorption modestly [^113PJVfn] [^112zy5LC] [^1159nshR].

> I need to ensure I distinguish this from systemic hormone therapy, where levels are intentionally therapeutic rather than physiologic. In real-world transdermal estradiol users, median levels are commonly in the 200–400 pmol/L (approximately 55–110 pg/mL) range, with substantial interindividual variability; importantly, up to a quarter of women on licensed doses may have subtherapeutic levels, which is why clinicians sometimes measure estradiol to troubleshoot inadequate symptom control, recognizing that clinical response remains the primary guide and that dose personalization is acceptable when justified [^115gbyGT] [^112XBzDj] [^1134k2WV].

> But wait, what about risk stratification using estradiol thresholds? I should double-check the historical 2.7 pg/mL cutoff. The JAMA raloxifene analysis found that women with estradiol above 10 pmol/L (about 2.7 pg/mL) had higher breast cancer risk and benefited more from raloxifene, but that threshold was derived from older assays; with modern ultrasensitive MS methods, many untreated women exceed 2.7 pg/mL, so this cutoff should not be applied directly to contemporary MS results for risk assignment without validation, even though it remains a useful historical anchor for hypothesis generation [^1163ft5A] [^114jYf98].

> I should confirm practical measurement caveats before concluding. Assay choice matters: LC/MS or GC/MS provides superior specificity and sensitivity at low concentrations compared with immunoassays, which risk false elevations from cross-reactivity. When results are discordant with the clinical picture, repeating estradiol using a standardized MS method and ensuring proper sampling technique can prevent misinterpretation, and clinicians should be cautious of spurious highs from gel contamination or analytical interference, repeating unexpected elevations before changing therapy [^113R9shJ] [^111grpac].

> Let me synthesize the actionable answer. For an untreated postmenopausal woman measured by a high-specificity MS assay, the expected reference interval is approximately undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL, with a typical mean around 3–5 pg/mL. Older women and those further from menopause are more likely to have undetectable values, and levels may be slightly higher in women with higher adiposity due to peripheral aromatization, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of assay methodology and individual factors [^116hw6zz] [^112BohK6] [^1136jwzZ].

---

Normal estradiol levels in postmenopausal women are **undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL** (undetectable to 39.3 pmol/L) when measured by high-sensitivity LC/MS/MS or GC/MS assays [^116hw6zz] [^111rzcTG]. Historically, immunoassays reported higher ranges (≤ 20–30 pg/mL), but these are now considered inaccurate due to cross-reactivity and limited sensitivity [^111rzcTG] [^113R9shJ]. Levels above 10.7 pg/mL may indicate ongoing ovarian activity, exogenous estrogen exposure, or assay interference and should be interpreted with caution [^111LvVj1] [^111grpac] [^115gbyGT].

## Physiological basis of low estradiol levels postmenopause

After menopause, ovarian estradiol production ceases, and circulating estradiol is derived from peripheral conversion of androgens — primarily androstenedione to estrone, with a small amount further converted to estradiol [^114uE6N6]. This peripheral production maintains very low estradiol levels, typically in the **undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL** range [^116hw6zz].

---

## Measurement methods and their impact on reference ranges

The accuracy of estradiol measurement in postmenopausal women is highly dependent on the assay used. Immunoassays, commonly used in clinical practice, have limitations — including cross-reactivity with other steroids and limited sensitivity at low concentrations — leading to falsely elevated results [^113R9shJ]. In contrast, **mass spectrometry-based methods** (LC/MS/MS and GC/MS) provide higher specificity and sensitivity, enabling accurate measurement of the very low estradiol concentrations found in postmenopausal women [^113R9shJ].

---

## Current reference ranges for estradiol in postmenopausal women

Recent studies using high-sensitivity mass spectrometry-based assays have established updated reference ranges for estradiol in postmenopausal women. The most commonly cited reference range is **undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL** (undetectable to 39.3 pmol/L) [^116hw6zz] [^115XtNpw]. This range reflects the physiological reality of minimal estradiol production after menopause and supersedes older immunoassay-based ranges of ≤ 20–30 pg/mL, which are now considered inaccurate [^111rzcTG].

---

## Factors influencing estradiol levels in postmenopausal women

Several factors can influence estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, including:

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: Higher BMI is associated with higher estradiol levels due to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue [^112mdoin] [^112JBAr6].
- **Age**: Estradiol levels tend to decrease further with advancing age, particularly beyond 70 years [^1136jwzZ].
- **Medications**: Certain medications, such as DHEA supplements, can increase estradiol levels [^115mTG81].
- **Assay interference**: Immunoassays may yield falsely elevated results due to cross-reactivity with other steroids or endogenous antibodies [^113R9shJ] [^111grpac].

---

## Clinical implications of estradiol levels in postmenopausal women

Estradiol levels in postmenopausal women have important clinical implications, including:

- **Bone health**: Low estradiol levels are associated with increased bone turnover and osteoporosis risk [^117VoRPw].
- **Cardiovascular health**: Low estradiol levels may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, although hormone therapy's role remains controversial [^113ib832].
- **Breast cancer risk**: Higher endogenous estradiol levels in postmenopausal women are associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly in women with estradiol levels above 2.7 pg/mL (10 pmol/L) [^1163ft5A] [^114xCsSw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate estradiol measurement in postmenopausal women. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the Endocrine Society recommend using **standardized, high-sensitivity assays** (LC/MS/MS or GC/MS) to establish reference ranges and guide clinical decision-making [^117ED91R] [^111Efeue]. Routine estradiol level monitoring is not generally recommended unless specific clinical indications arise, such as unexplained symptoms or suspected hormone-producing tumors.

## Summary of normal estradiol levels in postmenopausal women

| **Measurement method** | **Normal estradiol range** |
|-|-|
| Immunoassay (RIA) | ≤ 20–30 pg/mL (historical, now considered inaccurate) [^111rzcTG] |
| Mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS or GC/MS) | Undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL (current standard) [^116hw6zz] |

---

Normal estradiol levels in postmenopausal women are **undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL** when measured by high-sensitivity mass spectrometry-based assays. This range reflects minimal peripheral estradiol production after menopause and supersedes older immunoassay-based ranges. Accurate measurement using standardized assays is essential for clinical decision-making, and levels above this range may indicate ongoing ovarian activity, exogenous estrogen exposure, or assay interference.

Vaginal estrogen therapy — We recommend low-dose vaginal ET. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Randomized controlled trials of low-dose vaginal estrogen products report rapid improvement of vaginal and urinary symptoms within 2 to 3 weeks, with objective improvements continuing at 12 weeks and maintained to 1 year. Limited evidence suggests that vaginal ET may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and overactive bladder. Adverse effects include potential transfer to partner via penile or oral absorption and, with vaginal creams, residue on undergarments. During the initiation of therapy, vaginal atrophy may enhance systemic absorption, and when vaginal epithelium is restored, systemic absorption may decrease. Low-dose vaginal rings result in estradiol levels that remain within the normal postmenopausal range; however, bone resorption and lipid levels decrease, suggesting possible systemic effects, and insertion and removal at 3-month intervals may be difficult. For vaginal estradiol tablets, the 10-µg tablet provides standard twice weekly dosing, relieves vaginal symptoms by 8 weeks, is effective for at least 52 weeks, and therapy is initiated with daily administration for 2 weeks then twice weekly thereafter. Intermediate-dose estradiol tablets (25-µg) increase plasma estradiol from 3.1 ± 0.83 to 19.8 ± 6.1 pg/mL by 7 days, and an RCT of CEE vaginal cream ≥ 0.3 mg applied daily or twice weekly reported improvement in VVA by 12 weeks sustained for 52 weeks without reports of endometrial effects.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol gel 0.1% nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Factors associated with serum estradiol levels among postmenopausal women using hormone therapy [^112mdoin]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify factors associated with serum estradiol (E2) levels among healthy postmenopausal women using hormone therapy (HT).

Methods

This is an unplanned post hoc analysis of data from ELITE (Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol), a randomized controlled trial of 1 mg oral E2 with or without vaginal progesterone in healthy early compared with late (< 6 years compared with 10 or more years since menopause) postmenopausal women. We included results from visits when women reported at least 80% compliance with HT. Mixed-effects linear models identified factors associated with serum E2 levels while participants were taking HT, assessed every 6 months over a median follow-up of 4.8 years and adjusted for baseline E2 level, visit, and reduced E2 dose. Possible correlates evaluated included demographics, clinical characteristics, medication use, and biomarkers of liver and kidney metabolic function.

Results

The analysis included 2,160 E2 measurements in 275 postmenopausal women. Mean ± SD age was 55.4 ± 3.9 vs 64.4 ± 5.5 years, and mean ± SD time since menopause was 3.6 ± 1.8 vs 16.0 ± 5.6 years for early vs late postmenopausal women. Adjusted for pretreatment E2 level, visit, and reduced dose indicator, higher serum E2 levels were associated with higher body mass index (BMI), higher weight, surgical menopause, alcohol use, and antihypertensive medication use. Current and past smoking and antifungal medication use were associated with lower serum E2 levels. In the multivariable model, higher BMI and alcohol use were associated with higher serum E2 levels, whereas current and past smoking were associated with lower serum E2 levels. These factors were similar between early and late postmenopausal women.

Conclusion

Factors associated with serum E2 levels among postmenopausal women taking HT include BMI, alcohol use, and smoking. As serum E2 levels relate to HT effect, achievement of desirable E2 levels may be maximized through personalized intervention.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^1179tcpm]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

In serum from postmenopausal women that was used for validating estradiol assays utilizing GC or LC with MS, mean or median levels of estradiol ranged from < 0.5 to 3.6 pg/mL in five of the seven studies shown in Fig. 1. - In the two remaining studies (Fig. 1), estradiol levels were double or more of the five studies (6.0 and 8.6 pg/mL). One other study only reported a range of estradiol (8–14 pg/mL) in postmenopausal women, also slightly higher than the above five studies. The higher concentrations in these three latter studies cannot be explained by lower sensitivity since the limits of detection and/or quantification were 0.1 to 1 pg/mL. - Demographic details of the postmenopausal women for which serum samples were measured were not reported for most of these validation studies, so any reason for the difference in the estradiol concentrations of the three studies reporting higher estradiol concentrations cannot be determined. Thus, mean estradiol levels from these studies were not included in the above calculation for untreated postmenopausal women.

### The relationship between bone and reproductive hormones beyond estrogens and androgens [^1121XEUe]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

In Vivo Human Studies

Postmenopausal estrogen deficiency is a major risk factor for osteoporosis; however, it is now established that estrogen and progesterone work in tandem. Data from the Women's Health Initiative demonstrate that estrogen plus progesterone (compared to placebo) taken for an average of 5.6 years reduces the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women (hazard ratio, 0.76 overall). A more recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of more than 1000 menopausal women reported that estrogen plus progesterone therapy resulted in a superior increase in lumbar BMD compared to estrogen therapy alone, highlighting an additive action for progesterone.

During states of estrogen deficiency such as amenorrhea, and surgical and physiological menopause, low progesterone is almost indistinguishable temporally from low estrogen levels, making it difficult to isolate its effects. However, progesterone deficiency also occurs silently in conditions of subclinical ovulatory disturbance (SOD) whereby ovulation is disturbed with shorter luteal phases but normal cycle length and preserved estrogen levels. SOD therefore provides a useful context for the study of progesterone effects on female bone. Premenopausal women with lower BMD exhibit significantly lower progesterone levels despite regular cycles and frequently normal estrogen levels. Furthermore, studies of healthy premenopausal women have found levels of bone formation and resorption markers change across the menstrual cycle with increased markers of bone formation and higher osteoblastic activity occurring during the (progesterone-rich) luteal phase. However, most of these studies have not been able to differentiate ovulatory from anovulatory cycles, which limits the interpretation of their findings.

### Changes in estradiol and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women after changes in body mass index [^112JBAr6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Endogenous sex hormones are risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer. A potential route for favorable hormonal modification is weight loss.

Objective

The objective of the study was to measure change in plasma estradiol and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women in relation to change in body mass index (BMI) and plasma leptin.

Setting

The setting was a cohort study of over 100,000 female volunteers from the general population, United Kingdom.

Participants

The participants were a sample of 177 postmenopausal women aged over 45 years who provided blood samples during 2004–2005 and again during 2010–2011.

Main Outcome Measure

Outcomes were percentage change in plasma estradiol and testosterone levels per 1 kg/m² change in BMI and per 1 ng/mL change in plasma leptin.

Results

Among women with reduction in BMI, estradiol decreased 12.7% (95% confidence interval: [6.4%, 19.5%]; P < .0001) per kg/m² and among women with increased BMI estradiol increased 6.4% [0.2%, 12.9%] (P = 0.042). The corresponding figures for testosterone were 10.7% [3.0%, 19.0%] (P = 0.006) and 1.9% [-5.4%, 9.7%] (P = 0.61) per kg/m². For women with decreases and increases in leptin, estradiol decreased by 3.6% [1.3%, 6.0%] (P = 0.003) per ng/mL and increased by 1.7% [-0.3%, 3.6%] (P = 0.094), respectively. The corresponding figures for testosterone were 4.8% [2.0%, 7.8%] (P = 0.009) and 0.3% [-2.0%, 2.6%] (P = 0.82) per ng/mL.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal women, changes in BMI and plasma leptin occurring over several years are associated with changes in estradiol and testosterone levels. The results suggest that fat loss by an individual can result in substantial decreases in postmenopausal estradiol and testosterone levels and provides support for weight management to lessen breast cancer risk.

PATIENT INFORMATION

PATIENT INFORMATION ESTRADIOL GEL 0.1% (es-tra-DYE-ole)

Read this Patient Information leaflet before you start using estradiol gel 0.1% and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment.

What is estradiol gel 0.1%?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is a prescription medicine that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone). Estradiol gel 0.1% is a clear, colorless, smooth gel that is odorless when dry. When applied to the skin, estradiol is absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.

What is estradiol gel 0.1% used for?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is used after menopause to:

- Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes

Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

### Recombinant cell ultrasensitive bioassay for measurement of estrogens in postmenopausal women [^11313nzH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

A recent analysis of data from nine studies provided convincing evidence that plasma estradiol measurements predict the risk of breast cancer in normal postmenopausal women. However, the median values detected by the various assays used in this study varied by 5-fold. These and other published data in normal postmenopausal women suggest that assays measuring low plasma estradiol concentrations suffer from problems of sensitivity, specificity, and precision. Availability of a practical, low-cost, specific, precise, and ultrasensitive estrogen assay might allow enhanced prediction of the risk of breast cancer and provide an objective means of selecting postmenopausal women for breast cancer prevention. A recombinant cell ultrasensitive bioassay (RCUB) for estrogen was recently validated for use in prepubertal children. We postulated that the RCUB might also prove useful for measurement of postmenopausal levels and designed the present study to examine this possibility. Thirty normal postmenopausal volunteers provided blood samples for measurement of estrogen by RCUB and, for comparison, by RIA. The estrogenic activity measured by RCUB [mean ± sd, 11.9 ± 10.9 pmol/liter (SI units, 3.23 ± 2.96 pg/ml] was significantly lower than estradiol levels measured by RIA [43.7 ± 44.0 pmol/liter (11.9 ± 12.0 pg/ml)] in our volunteer subjects (P < 0.00001). Nonetheless, plasma estradiol levels measured by bioassay were significantly correlated with the estrogenic activity measured by RIA (r = 0.84) and by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (r = 0.85). To obtain biological evidence of the validity of the RCUB, we related plasma estrogen levels to body weight and body mass index and found highly significant correlations (r = 0.54 and r = 0.53, respectively). Surprisingly, 28 of 30 postmenopausal women were found to have estrogen levels in the prepubertal range with the RCUB. The levels detected by RCUB were similar to those previously reported using an ultrasensitive but less practical yeast bioassay. These results provide validation for the RCUB in postmenopausal women and suggest that it might prove useful for selection of women for drug therapy to prevent breast cancer.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^113arpkW]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The present study has several strengths. First, in contrast to previous studies with small sample sizes, this study included 1,508 women. Second, the use of real-world data enhance the generalizability of our results. To our knowledge, this is the only study that has included both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and the only study to include women using both licensed and off-label doses. Use of real-world data also accounts for factors known to influence both interindividual and intraindividual variation, including adherence and imperfect use, and provides a unique insight into the range of estradiol levels encountered in clinical practice. Third, this study was conducted in a single center and serum estradiol concentrations were measured in a single lab using the same, validated immunoassay kit, allowing for direct comparison of serum estradiol concentrations in women using different formulations and doses. Our study also has several limitations. First, perimenopausal women (women < 50 y) were included but the sample size was small (n = 242, 16% of the study cohort). Consequently, there is greater uncertainty in the results obtained for younger women and more research is needed to accurately define the reference range for serum estradiol in younger women using transdermal estradiol. Statistical modeling accounts for smaller sample sizes, so this does not affect the results obtained in subgroup comparisons. Second, 95% of Newson Health Clinic attendees are White British and, compared with the general population, women who access private healthcare are less deprived and less likely to experience ill-health. Ethnicity, healthy lifestyle behaviors (such as smoking and physical activity), comorbidities and polypharmacy, influence estradiol pharmacokinetics and serum levels. This limits the generalizability of our findings. Further, women attending a menopause clinic, especially those having blood tests, are more likely to experience difficult symptoms and/or have issues with absorption compared with women managed in primary care. As such, their dose requirements may be different, and the prevalence of "poor absorbers" in the background population may be lower. Third, time of recorded dose and blood sampling may have differed by up to 3 months and it is possible that the dose recorded may not have always been the dose used at the time of sampling. Moreover, while compliance with transdermal HT is generally good, up to 25% of women may not take their HT as prescribed. Poor or suboptimal adherence may have resulted in underestimation of the upper limits of the observed reference ranges, and overestimation of the prevalence of 'poor absorbers'. Fourth, estimation of dose equivalence and the use of immunoassay to measure serum estradiol concentration limit the accuracy of our results. Although more accurate quantification of the relationship between estradiol dose and level would be interesting, it would be of limited clinical value because, as we have shown, interindividual variation is substantial and dose should be clinically guided. Furthermore, gold standard mass spectrometry-based techniques are not widely available, and our immunoassay-based results more accurately reflect real-world conditions. Finally, a one off serum estradiol level is not a reliable reflection of total body exposure (the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve), or local estradiol levels in target tissues, and therefore does not predict clinical efficacy or safety. However, our findings are clinically relevant because if HT users with persistent menopausal symptoms are found to have a low estradiol level, a higher (+/− off-label) dose can be safely tried, which is reassuring for both women and clinicians.

### Serum estradiol level and risk of breast cancer during treatment with raloxifene [^1163ft5A]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

As endogenous estradiol increases, risk of breast cancer increases. Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer and other outcomes.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels.

Design

Analysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999.

Setting

One hundred eighty community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United States.

Participants

A total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay. Women with a history of breast cancer or estrogen use were excluded.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d of raloxifene (n = 4843) or matching placebo (n = 2447) for 4 years.

Main Outcome Measure

New cases of histopathologically confirmed breast cancer in the treatment and placebo groups, stratified by estradiol levels.

Results

In the placebo group, women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL) had a 6.8-fold higher rate of breast cancer (3.0% per 4 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8%-4.1%) than that of women with undetectable estradiol levels (0.6% per 4 years; 95% CI, 0%-1.1%; p = 0.005 for trend). Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI, 53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; p = 0.02 for the interaction). In this cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases.

Conclusions

Measurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.

Low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) — risk profile and adverse events: Because serum estradiol levels during therapy usually fall within the normal postmenopausal range, the risk profile with low-dose vaginal ET is expected to be lower than with systemic ET; however, long-term endometrial safety data are lacking and 1 year is the maximum duration of randomized controlled trials of vaginal ET; side effects include vulvovaginal candidiasis and, with higher dosing and systemic absorption, vaginal bleeding and breast pain; increased CVD or VTE risk has not been reported; and available evidence does not support the boxed warning regarding increased risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, dementia, and breast cancer.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^116DCwsy]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study are to explore the range and variation in serum estradiol concentration, and to estimate the prevalence of "poor absorption" (women using licensed estradiol doses with subtherapeutic levels), in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol in the real world.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional analysis in a specialist menopause clinic in the UK.

Results

Serum samples were obtained from 1,508 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. A total of 61.87% were using licensed doses. The median estradiol concentration was 355.26 pmol/L (interquartile range 198.44–646.15 pmol/L). A reference interval for the whole cohort was defined as 54.62–2,050.55 pmol/L. There was substantial interindividual variation across the dose range. Variance was greater in younger women (P = 0.002) and gel users (P = 0.002). There was a trend toward greater variance in women using higher doses, but the association failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.074). One in four women (24.84%) using the highest licensed dose had subtherapeutic levels (< 200 pmol/L). Older women (≥ 50 y) and patch users were more likely to have low levels (odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.22–2.62, P = 0.003; and odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.18–1.95, P = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

The reference interval for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women using on-label and off-label doses of transdermal estradiol in the real world is wide, and there is considerable interindividual variation. The number of estradiol users with low estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L) is higher than previously recognized. Measurement of serum estradiol can be helpful to identify women who may benefit from an off-label dose. Dose customization is key to ensure that all women can reap the benefits of HT.

### Estradiol (Divigel) [^115qJzvK]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Divigel nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### The menopausal transition – endocrinology [^112axZTg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Melbourne Women's MidLife Health Project (MWMHP) and related studies have yielded valuable information regarding the endocrine changes of the menopausal transition, which are summarized in this review.

Aim

To describe the endocrinology of the menopause transition.

Main Outcome Measures

Includes changes in inhibins A and B, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol, cross-sectionally in regularly cycling volunteers, and longitudinally (including testosterone) in women passing through the menopause transition.

Methods

Early follicular phase hormone concentrations were measured by well-characterized immunoassays in normal volunteers aged 20–50 years, and in 438 subjects initially recruited between ages 45 and 55 for a longitudinal study of the menopause transition, the MWMHP, in which annual blood samples were obtained. The data summarized here includes the first 6 years of follow-up. These volunteers also recorded menstrual cycle data and responded to detailed annual questionnaires.

Results

In regularly cycling female volunteers aged more than 40 years, it was established that inhibin B is a significant determinant of circulating FSH levels. From the MWMHP, the central endocrine event marking the onset of menstrual irregularity was shown to be a fall in follicular phase inhibin B concentrations, with a nonsignificant rise in FSH and no change in estradiol or inhibin A. Cross-sectional analysis of data from women in the early stages of the MWMHP showed a wide variation in circulating FSH levels, irrespective of menopausal status, indicating that single FSH measurements provide little useful information regarding menopausal status. Based on the prospective determination of the date of final menses (FMP), it was shown that estradiol levels begin to fall and FSH levels to rise about 2 years before FMP. At the time of FMP, FSH levels were approximately 50% of those ultimately reached postmenopausally, while estradiol had fallen by approximately 50% from reproductive age levels. Despite a major decline in sexual function, as women transited the menopause, there was no significant decline in circulating testosterone levels, the decline in sexual function being correlated with the decline in estradiol, not testosterone. Analysis of data from related studies showed that endocrinologically normal ovulatory cycles could be observed in women who had already experienced cycle irregularity, even more than 3 months of amenorrhea, and could occur close to or at the time of FMP.

Conclusions

An extensive database on the endocrinology of the menopause transition, including both cross-sectional and longitudinal information, has been obtained.

### The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of different estrogens are not equivalent [^1149wn1F]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

In the next decade many women will turn to the medical community for advice on maintaining or improving health after menopause. Estrogen replacement therapy, with or without progestins, alleviates menopausal symptoms, prevents or manages osteoporosis, and reduces the increased cardiovascular disease risk that results from estrogen deficiency caused by ovarian decline. Although several estrogen replacement products are available, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of these products may vary depending on either the estrogen formulation or the route of administration, or both. For example, oral estrogens, which elicit a marked hepatic response, induce greater beneficial effects on serum lipoproteins than transdermal estrogens, which circumvent first-pass liver metabolism. Oral conjugated estrogens and transdermal estradiol increase bone density and prevent bone loss. This article summarizes the studies comparing estrogen formulations and discusses the differential effects of various estrogen products that promote postmenopausal health.

### Estrone is a strong predictor of circulating estradiol in women age 70 years and older [^1136jwzZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

After menopause, estradiol (E2) is predominately an intracrine hormone circulating in very low serum concentrations.

Objective

The objective of this work is to examine determinants of E2 concentrations in women beyond age 70 years.

Design and Setting

A cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted.

Participants

A total of 5325 women participated, with a mean age of 75.1 years (± 4.2 years) and not using any sex steroid, antiandrogen/estrogen, glucocorticoid, or antiglycemic therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Sex steroids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Values below the limit of detection (LOD; E2 11 pmol/L [3 pg/mL] were assigned a value of LOD/√2 to estimate total E2.

Results

E2 and estrone (E1) were below the LOD in 66.1% and 0.9% of women, respectively. The median (interdecile ranges) for E1 and detectable E2 were 181.2 pmol/L (range, 88.7–347.6 pmol/L) and 22.0 pmol/L (range, 11.0–58.7 pmol/L). Women with undetectable E2 vs detectable E2 were older (median age 74.1 years vs 73.8, P = 0.02), leaner (median body mass index [BMI] 26.8 kg/m2 vs 28.5, P < .001), and had lower E1, testosterone and DHEA concentrations (P < .001). A linear regression model, including age, BMI, E1, and testosterone, explained 20.9% of the variation in total E2, but explained only an additional 1.2% of variation over E1 alone. E1 and testosterone made significant contributions (r2 = 0.162, P < .001) in a model for the subset of women with detectable E2.

Conclusions

Our findings support E1 as a principal circulating estrogen and demonstrate a robust association between E1 and E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women. Taken together with prior evidence for associations between E1 and health outcomes, E1 should be included in studies examining associations between estrogen levels and health outcomes in postmenopausal women.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^115XtNpw]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives:

To critically evaluate published systemic estradiol levels during use of low-dose vaginal estrogens considering detection method and estrogen dose; describe challenges with accurately measuring estradiol; and determine the normal estradiol level range in postmenopausal women.

Methods:

PubMed was searched for studies reporting systemic estradiol levels with lower-dose vaginal estrogens (≤ 25 μg estradiol or 0.3 mg conjugated equine estrogens). Estradiol levels at baseline and during treatment, area under the curve, and maximum estradiol concentrations were summarized by dose within assay type. A proposed range of systemic estradiol in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women was estimated by conservatively pooling means and standard deviations from published studies.

Results:

Mean basal estradiol levels were 3.1 to 4.9 pg/mL using liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC or GC/MS/MS) with a range of undetectable to 10.5 pg/mL using radioimmunoassay. Systemic estradiol levels with vaginal estrogens reflected their doses as measured with LC or GC/MS/MS in different studies: 7.1 to 9.1 pg/mL and 16.7 to 22.7 pg/mL with a 25-μg softgel capsule insert and a tablet insert, respectively; 4.6 to 7.4 pg/mL and 6.6 to 14.8 pg/mL with a 10-μg softgel capsule and a tablet insert, respectively; and 3.6 to 3.9 pg/mL with a 4-μg softgel capsule insert. A mean systemic estradiol concentration ranging from undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL is proposed as an estimate for basal estradiol levels in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Systemic estradiol absorption may be influenced by the placement of estradiol higher (as with an applicator) versus lower (as without an applicator) in the vagina, as estradiol transport to the uterus would be more likely further away than closer to the introitus.

Conclusion:

Serum estradiol concentrations were generally lower when measured with more specific and sensitive assays. Estradiol absorption was dose-dependent, and may be influenced by dose, formulation, and positioning in the vagina. Very low systemic estradiol absorption with low/ultralow-dose vaginal estrogens may potentially decrease any adverse events that may be associated with higher doses of vaginal estrogens used for treating moderate to severe VVA due to less estradiol exposure.

Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start taking Estradiol Valerate Injection and read what you get each time you refill Estradiol Valerate Injection. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is Estradiol Valerate Injection?

Estradiol Valerate Injection is a medicine that contains estrogen hormones.

What is Estradiol Valerate Injection used for?

Estradiol Valerate Injection is used after menopause to:

reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feeling of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Estradiol Valerate Injection.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^1179TVay]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Validity of lifetime estradiol exposure hypothesis can be challenged by recent in vivo multimodality imaging study findings showing a gradual increase in estrogen receptor density in the brain during the menopause transition, accompanied by changes in brain volume, perfusion, and energy metabolism. Significant overlap with estrogen-regulated brain networks linked to reproductive and higher-order cognitive functions was observed, independent of chronological age and plasma estradiol levels. This suggests a novel connection between female endocrine aging and heightened expression of estrogen receptors in brain regions associated with cognitive functions, spanning mood, memory, stress, pain, and fine motor skills. Also supporting the concept of estrogenic and biochemical adjustments during perimenopause and early postmenopausal phases that are linked to health issues.

Sex hormones vary throughout the lifespan and most important shifts depend on reproductive stage known as reproductive ageing. Although age correlated with reproductive age, the actual developmental stage cannot be determined solely based on chronological age. At puberty, girls typically experience menarche between ages 9 and 18 years; this stage is characterised by elevated levels of estradiol and profound changes in the brain and body from childhood to puberty, (please see earlier reviews). Menopause marks the end of fertility and is linked to a decrease in estradiol levels, with estrone becoming the dominant form of estrogen in postmenopausal women. These reproductive stages are critical periods defined by major hormonal changes, acting as important proxy measures primarily reflecting fluctuations in estradiol levels.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^111grpac]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Seven women (0.46%) were observed to have very high estradiol levels (> 4,000 pmol/L). All the women were clinically well, and all had normal or low levels when the blood test was repeated, suggesting that the results were erroneous. Gel contamination due to prior application at the site of venepuncture may cause spuriously high levels in clinical practice. False elevation of estradiol may also occur when there are analytical errors, for example, due to the presence of cross-reacting substances that compete with estradiol for antibody binding (eg, prednisolone, cortisol), or interfering substances that impact other components of the immunoassay (eg, heterophile antibodies, autoantibodies, biotin). - This highlights the importance of repeating a blood test before adjusting the dose in women without symptoms of estrogen excess (such as nausea, headaches, mastalgia, bleeding).

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^11142odu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In humans and other mammals, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a vital prohormone primarily produced by the adrenal glands. It serves as a precursor to biologically active androgens and estrogens. After being synthesized in the adrenal cortex, DHEA is taken up by various tissues, including the liver, gonads, kidneys, and brain, where it is metabolized into different steroid hormones depending on the specific tissue context. In the bloodstream, DHEA is largely converted into its sulfated form, DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), which circulates at much higher concentrations and can be further metabolized into active sex hormones as needed.

DHEA levels decline significantly with age, decreasing by approximately 70% between the ages of 20 and 60, primarily due to reduced adrenal production. DHEA supplementation has been explored as an adjunct therapy for postmenopausal women, alongside hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and has demonstrated potential benefits in improving metabolic and endocrine function, as well as sexual health. DHEA exerts androgenic, estrogenic, and steroidal effects and has been associated with various biological functions, including antioxidant properties, neuroprotection, and anticancer activity. Supplementation may help maintain hormonal balance, enhance mood, support brain function, and potentially mitigate age-related decline.

Estradiol, the most potent female sex hormone, fluctuates throughout a woman's life and menstrual cycle. It plays a critical role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis by modulating the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), with both positive and negative feedback effects. In postmenopausal women, circulating levels of both testosterone and DHEA gradually decline, though a transient increase in hormone levels may occur during the menopausal transition.

Several studies have suggested that DHEA supplementation can influence the biosynthesis of estradiol and testosterone. However, the relationship remains inconclusive due to conflicting results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While some evidence suggests potential benefits, a previous meta-analysis involving peri- and postmenopausal women reported that DHEA did not significantly improve quality of life or menopausal symptoms and had only modest effects on sexual function. It was also associated with androgenic side effects, such as skin changes.

Although prior meta-analyses have investigated the effects of DHEA on hormone levels, none have focused specifically on postmenopausal women. Therefore, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the effect of DHEA supplementation on serum testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, with the goal of clarifying the impact of dosage and treatment duration.

### Polymorphisms associated with circulating sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women [^1147nie1]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Reports suggest a relationship between circulating sex hormone levels and breast cancer risk, but genetic association studies have been inconclusive. We investigated the association between levels of sex hormones and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for the enzymes that regulate them.

Methods

We assayed circulating levels of estradiol, testosterone, estrone, androstenedione, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in 1975 normal postmenopausal women. Fifteen SNPs in the CYP17, CYP19, EDH17B2, SHBG, COMT, and CYP1B1 genes were genotyped in these postmenopausal women and in a breast cancer case-control study. Associations of genotypes with breast cancer risk were evaluated in the case-control study and with hormone levels in the postmenopausal women using multiple linear regression with assay batch, body mass index, parity, peri- or postmenopausal status, and age band as covariates.

Results

CYP19 SNPs (rs10046 and [TCT] ±) were associated with differences in estradiol level (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and the estradiol: testosterone ratio (P = 0.000001() and P = 0.002). SNP rs10046 explained 1.6% of the variance (r2) in the estradiol: testosterone ratio. SHBG SNPs (5' untranslated region [5'UTR] g-a and D356N) were associated with both SHBG levels (P < 10(-6) and P = 0.005) and the estradiol: SHBG ratio (P = ().000008() and P = 0.01). These SNPs explained 2.4% and 0.6% of the variance in SHBG levels, respectively. SNPs in the other genes were not associated with differences in any hormone levels, and none were statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk.

Conclusion

Genetic variation in CYP19 and SHBG contributes to variance in circulating hormone levels between postmenopausal women, but low r2 values may explain why these genes have given inconclusive results in breast cancer case-control studies.

### Estradiol levels predict short-term adverse health outcomes in postmenopausal acute stroke women [^113CpuBA]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the role of endogenous sex steroids in cerebrovascular disease are sparse. Estradiol is a hormone with diverse actions on the central nervous system. Our aim was to investigate the role of circulating estradiol levels in a postmenopausal acute stroke population.

Methods

During a time-period of 2 years, we prospectively studied 302 postmenopausal female patients hospitalized for an acute stroke in two tertiary hospitals. We addressed the question whether endogenous estradiol is associated with stroke severity on admission and functional outcome 1 month after stroke, as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), respectively.

Results

Estradiol levels were significantly related to stroke severity on admission, as expressed by NIHSS, even after correcting for confounding factors in the multivariate analysis (beta 0.353, P < 0.001). Estradiol was an independent determinant of 1-month mortality and adverse functional outcome (mRS ≥ 4), [odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.341 (1.617–6.902), P = 0.001 and 2.277 (1.273–4.074), P = 0.006, respectively].

Conclusions

We identified an independent association of endogenous estradiol levels with stroke severity and short-term mortality and outcome. These findings suggest challenging the role of estradiol as a neuroprotective agent.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^116hw6zz]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Mean basal levels of systemic estradiol in normal, generally healthy, untreated, postmenopausal women are approximately 3.9 pg/mL based on the mean estradiol levels reported in published clinical studies - (Fig. 1) using LC or GC with MS to detect serum estradiol. Published standard deviations (SDs) from mean estradiol levels in postmenopausal women ranged from 0.15 to 3.4 for various treatment groups (including placebo) at baseline, - from 3.0 to 12.5 for untreated or control womenwith or without VVA, and 0.4 to 3.2 from women using placebo (at time-points other than baseline). One studyreported an SD of 12.5 in one group of patients, with SDs of 3.03 and 3.29 in the other two groups, suggesting that the SD of 12.5 is an outlier, and as such, was discarded from our estimated range of normal estradiol levels. From the full SD range of 0.15 to 3.4, - conservatively calculating a 95% confidence interval (CI) from the largest SD of ± 3.4 (3.4 × 2 = 6.8), and then adding and subtracting 6.8 to and from a mean of 3.9 (average of mean estradiol levels reported in clinical studies of Fig. 1) gives an estimated range of undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL. As discussed below, this normal range would only be a preliminary estimate with the requirement to update it with a large number of samples measured with a state-of-the-art assay, including women without VVA and specifically identifying women having undergone oophorectomy.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114jYf98]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. One of the primary limitations of our study and similar studies is the lack of a clear cutoff threshold for what concentration of circulating estradiol defines an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Our analysis used the cutoff of 2.7 pg/mL, which is based on a single study from 2002. Assays have changed dramatically since the publication of that study, and interpretation of all findings should take into account the newer ultrasensitive assays used in our studies. For these reasons, it is unlikely that this cutoff point is an appropriate marker for clinical risk with modern assays. Our study participants were part of a randomized clinical trial, which mitigates the impact of unmeasured confounders, but we did not have sufficient prevalence to assess potential confounders, such as alcohol use or smoking.

### Measurement of serum estradiol levels in postmenopausal women-reply… [^114MgvCA]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Stephen J. LurieMD, PhD, Senior EditorIndividualAuthor In Reply: We agree with Dr Stanczyk that it is preferable to measure very low levels of estradiol using assays that have a purification step and that have been tested for reproducibility at the very low levels of estradiol that we studied. According to SciCor Central. Laboratory Services, the double antibody method that we used is specific to estradiol: there is 12. 5% cross-reactivity with estrone and no more than 6% cross-reactivity with other estrogen metabolites, and no significant cross-reactivity with nonestrogens. Nevertheless, these measurements. were made nearly 8 years ago for the purpose of determining whether participants were postmenopausal. We took advantage of those existing data to test our hypotheses. If the estradiol assay had less than optimal reliability, this would add random error to the estradiol levels. This random error would have.

caused us to underestimate the magnitude of the associations between estradiol, raloxifene treatment, and breast cancer risk, and thus our estimates are probably conservative. We are in the process of confirming these observations using different validated and standardized ultrasensitive assays of estradiol in other randomized trials of selective estrogen receptor modulators. Until these. results are available, we reiterate that it is premature for clinicians to base decisions about use of selective estrogen receptor modulators on routinely available measurements of estradiol.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114xCsSw]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

There are very few data to help define a safe systemic estradiol concentration after menopause. Serum estrogen levels are associated with individual participant characteristics, including body mass index (BMI). A systematic review found that common vaginal estrogen treatment regimens are associated with posttreatment mean estradiol concentrations ranging from 8.6 to 30 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 3.671), depending on the type of estrogen product and type of assay used to measure the hormone. A meta-analysis of breast cancer risk with endogenous hormone concentrationsused data from 9 studies with median serum estradiol levels ranging from 5.9 to 36.5 pg/mL and suggested greater risk for breast cancer with higher serum estradiol or estrone levels. In a randomized clinical trial of 7290 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, those randomly assigned to placebo with baseline serum estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL had a significantly greater risk (6.8-fold higher) for breast cancer during 4 years compared with those with baseline concentrations lower than or equal to 2.72 pg/mL. Also, randomization to raloxifene treatment significantly reduced breast cancer risk compared with placebo, but only in the subset of women with baseline estradiol levels higher than 2.72 pg/mL. These results suggest that concentrations above this threshold may be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer.

We hypothesized that use of vaginal estrogen in women with bothersome vaginal symptoms would not lead to a significant increase in serum estradiol concentrations at 12 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we compared change in serum estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations during 12 weeks of treatment in the active vs placebo groups of a randomized clinical trial of a vaginal estradiol tablet for treatment of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort. We included SHBG because lower levels have independently been associated with cardiovascular risk, and because oral estrogen treatment has been shown to increase SHBG levels. Because of the high level of imprecision and nonspecificity of estradiol and estrone immunoassays in the low range prevalent among women during menopause, we measured these hormones using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program.

### Interpreting plasma estrogen levels in breast cancer: caution needed… [^113xmhtN]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Plasma estrogen levels have been measured in many research studies and have been used to direct clinical management in patients with breast cancer. When used with samples from postmenopausal women, most assays are not adequately accurate for this purpose, and unfortunately there are few available assays that do have the required accuracy and precision. 1, 2, 3. Endogenous Estrogens Estrogens are synthesized when androstenedione and testosterone are converted to estrone and estradiol, respectively, by the aromatase enzyme. In premenopausal women, estrogen production occurs principally in the ovaries, resulting in circulating levels of estradiol, ranging from 100 pmol/L to 1, 000 pmol/L. In postmenopausal women, estrogen synthesis occurs mostly in peripheral tissues, particularly subcutaneous fat. 4Aromatization also occurs in the peripheral tissues and testes of men.

Calculations of the theoretical expected amount of circulating E2 in postmenopausal women have been made and indicate mean levels in the range 10 pmol/L to 20 pmol/L. 5Yet, E2 levels often measure higher when using radioimmunoassays. Considering the E2 measurements made for the controls in nine prospective studies of breast cancer risk, four studies that implemented direct assays had median E2 levels of 21. 7 pmol/L to 101 pmol/L, 6–9and the studies that used indirect assays had median E2 levels ranging from 22 pmol/L to
58. 7 pmol/L. 10–14Using mass spectrometry, E2 levels are generally lower, 15and using bioassays they are lower still, with mean values of 7. 2 pmol/L to 12 pmol/L. 16, 17.

Application of Estradiol Measurements in Breast Cancer In postmenopausal women, breast cancer risk is positively associated with circulating levels of endogenous estrogens to the degree that their measurement is being considered for risk stratification in screening and prevention measures. For this to be achieved, accurate, well-validated, and rugged assays for E2 are essential. 26, 27leads to confusion in the literature and emphasizes the importance of informed, expert peer review.

### Estradiol and norethindrone acetate [^111EQQtE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^116kPVFK]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To critically evaluate published systemic estradiol levels during use of low-dose vaginal estrogens considering detection method and estrogen dose; describe challenges with accurately measuring estradiol; and determine the normal estradiol level range in postmenopausal women.

Methods

PubMed was searched for studies reporting systemic estradiol levels with lower-dose vaginal estrogens (≤ 25μg estradiol or 0.3mg conjugated equine estrogens). Estradiol levels at baseline and during treatment, area under the curve, and maximum estradiol concentrations were summarized by dose within assay type. A proposed range of systemic estradiol in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women was estimated by conservatively pooling means and standard deviations from published studies.

Results

Mean basal estradiol levels were 3.1 to 4.9pg/mL using liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC or GC/MS/MS) with a range of undetectable to 10.5pg/mL using radioimmunoassay. Systemic estradiol levels with vaginal estrogens reflected their doses as measured with LC or GC/MS/MS in different studies: 7.1 to 9.1pg/mL and 16.7 to 22.7pg/mL with a 25-μg softgel capsule insert and a tablet insert, respectively; 4.6 to 7.4pg/mL and 6.6 to 14.8pg/mL with a 10-μg softgel capsule and a tablet insert, respectively; and 3.6 to 3.9pg/mL with a 4-μg softgel capsule insert. A mean systemic estradiol concentration ranging from undetectable to 10.7pg/mL is proposed as an estimate for basal estradiol levels in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Systemic estradiol absorption may be influenced by the placement of estradiol higher (as with an applicator) versus lower (as without an applicator) in the vagina, as estradiol transport to the uterus would be more likely further away than closer to the introitus.

Conclusion

Serum estradiol concentrations were generally lower when measured with more specific and sensitive assays. Estradiol absorption was dose-dependent, and may be influenced by dose, formulation, and positioning in the vagina. Very low systemic estradiol absorption with low/ultralow-dose vaginal estrogens may potentially decrease any adverse events that may be associated with higher doses of vaginal estrogens used for treating moderate to severe VVA due to less estradiol exposure.

### Selection of appropriate biomarkers to monitor effectiveness of ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal patients with ER + breast cancer [^111LvVj1]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Estradiol

Estradiol (E 2) levels ≥ 40 pg/mL are commonly used to establish pre-menopausal status in the absence of regular menstrual cycles for GnRH agonist trial eligibility. Measurements of E 2 are also useful as a marker for endocrine sensitivity, as well as to monitor compliance/adherence and refine treatment regimens. Finding E 2 levels within the pre-menopausal range in women receiving GnRH agonist treatment is indicative of incomplete ovarian function suppression per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. Typically, an E 2 level ≤ 10 pg/mL is consistent with menopausal status with ovarian function suppression, and an appropriate level at which an AI can be utilized. Inadequate ovarian function suppression may reduce the impact of AI.

It should be noted that E 2 monitoring guidelines are not currently available, so the optimal degree of ovarian suppression is undetermined. Although individual clinical laboratories that assay E 2 levels have established acceptable reference ranges, these may differ between laboratories and may not be consistent between assay methods. The gold standard gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measurement of extracted E 2 is more sensitive and specific, but is more expensive and tedious to perform than the immunoassay which may cross-react with other steroids since estradiol is not extracted nor purified. Accuracy and reliability of E 2 assays are known to falter particularly at the low concentration ranges. Timing of blood sampling may also affect the results of E 2 assays, since E 2 exhibits a diurnal cycle such that early morning peaks may differ from a random sample during the day. Although there are no standards regarding timing for estradiol assessment in the real-world setting, the SOFT Estrogen Substudy measured E 2 at 3, 6, and 12 months.

The relationship between serum estradiol concentration and age, estradiol dose, and formulation, as predicted by the model, is illustrated in Figure 2.

FIG. 2
Predicted estradiol concentration (95% confidence interval) according to estradiol dose, age and formulation using a linear model. The predicted values (plus 95% confidence intervals) of estradiol concentration (pmol/L) according to estradiol dose (number of pump equivalents, PE), age (< 50 or ≥ 50 y) and estradiol formulation (patch or gel) from the linear model of log-transformed estradiol concentration. Gel users are shown in the left-hand plot, patch users are represented in the right-hand plot. Predicted values for women ≥ 50 years are shown in blue (n = 1,266, 83.95%); predicted values in younger women (< 50 y) are shown in red (n = 242, 16.05%). The larger confidence intervals in women < 50 years reflect a greater degree of uncertainty due to the smaller sample size. The plots demonstrate that at any given dose, predicted estradiol levels are greatest for women ≥ 50 years using estradiol gel. Whilst the predicted values increase with dose, the confidence intervals associated with off-label doses are larger and overlap, indicating a greater degree of uncertainty in the off-label dose range. One and seven PE were excluded from the model as there were insufficient data points (29 and 33 women respectively). > 8 PE was excluded from the model due to being a heterogeneous group.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

Additional Factors Contributing to Perimenopausal Bone Loss

While menopausal bone loss in this Perspective has been considered largely in the context of estrogen deficiency, we do recognize that there are a number of additional hormonal changes during menopause that may contribute to bone loss. Thus the observation that early menopausal bone loss begins even when serum estradiol levels are normal led to the hypothesis a number of years ago by Prior and colleagues that luteal phase defects and reductions in progesterone levels during perimenopause contribute to bone loss during this period. In addition to progesterone, androgen levels also decrease during the menopausal transition and could contribute to bone loss. Recently, Perrien and colleagues demonstrated marked reductions in serum inhibins (A and B) during menopause in women and found that the decreases in inhibin levels were associated with increases in bone turnover markers. In addition, Ebeling and colleagues have found that increases in bone-resorption markers in perimenopausal women were best correlated not with serum estradiol levels but rather with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Subsequent data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) showed that spine and hip aBMD losses during the menopausal transition were most strongly related to the interaction between initial FSH levels and longitudinal FSH changes and not to estradiol or androgen levels. These findings raised the possibility that FSH may have direct effects on bone; however, as noted by the authors of that study, FSH also could be a better predictor of aBMD changes during perimenopause than estradiol because it may serve as a more robust proxy measure of ovarian dynamics involving estradiol than single estradiol measurements. In rodent studies, Sun and colleagues examined the skeletal phenotype of FSH receptor null (FORKO) mice and found that despite being hypogonadal, these mice had normal bone mass. These investigators also found that osteoclasts and their precursors possessed FSH receptors and that FSH [but not luteinizing hormone (LH)] increased osteoclast formation and function in vitro, and they concluded that high circulating FSH levels caused hypogonadal bone loss. By contrast, Gao and colleagues subsequently found that the FORKO mice did have reduced bone mass; moreover, bilateral ovariectomy reduced the elevated circulating testosterone levels in the FORKO mice and decreased bone mass to levels indistinguishable from those in ovariectomized control mice. These investigators came to the opposite conclusion from that of Sun and colleagues, namely, that sex steroids regulated bone turnover in the FORKO mice independently of any bone-resorptive action of FSH. Consistent with this, Drake and colleagues found that suppression of FSH levels in postmenopausal women into the premenopausal range for 4 months failed to reduce bone-resorption markers, indicating that FSH is likely not an important regulator of bone resorption in humans. While FSH is unlikely to contribute to postmenopausal bone loss, the precise roles of changes in progesterone, androgen, and inhibin levels in enhancing the effects of estrogen deficiency on bone loss during the perimenopausal period remain to be fully defined.

### Physical activity and sex hormone levels in estradiol-and placebo-treated postmenopausal women [^111DRKL4]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Postmenopausal changes in the hormonal milieu in women with or without hormone therapy are hypothesized to be the pathway for a number of menopause-associated modifications in physiology and disease risk. Physical activity may modify these changes in women's hormone profiles. The crucial yet complex relationship between physical activity and physiologic and pharmacologic sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women has not been investigated sufficiently.

Methods

Using structured recall, physical activity was assessed longitudinally during a period of 2 years in 194 postmenopausal women (90 randomized to 1 mg 17β-estradiol treatment daily and 104 randomized to placebo) in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. The levels of physical activity were correlated with the serum sex hormone and the serum hormone-binding globulin levels in each treatment group.

Results

Among the placebo-treated women, total energy expenditure was positively associated with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; P < 0.001) and inversely associated with testosterones (total, bioavailable, or free) and androstenedione (P < 0.001 for all), as well as with estradiol (P = 0.02). In estradiol-treated women, estradiol levels were inversely associated with total energy expenditure (P = 0.002) and weekly hours spent in moderate or more vigorous physical activity (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Physical activity is associated with lower serum levels of estradiol in both hormone therapy-treated and untreated women. In placebo-treated women only, physical activity is associated with reduced androgen levels and elevated SHBG levels.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^114pm8A7]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Limited data suggest that up to 20% of women are "poor absorbers" of transdermal estradiol. It is essential that 'poor absorbers' with subtherapeutic levels are prescribed higher doses to relieve symptoms and mitigate risks associated with chronic estrogen deficiency. For some women, therapeutic levels will only be achieved using off-label doses. However, a recent safety alert in the UK warned against prescribing estrogen "in doses higher than the upper limit listed in the individual Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) as these limits are informed by the results of clinical trials, to ensure patient safety". In fact, early dose finding studies were focused on establishing pharmacokinetic parameters and/or clinical efficacy — they were not designed to assess long-term safety.,

There are no safety data in women using high (off-label) estradiol doses. However, as many women using high doses are "poor absorbers" with normal estradiol levels, it is highly unlikely that they will be at greater risk of harm than "good absorbers" who achieve normal levels using on-label doses. Indeed, failing to prescribe a dose sufficient to elevate serum estradiol levels into the therapeutic range is more likely to cause harm because women will continue to experience distressing symptoms, and they will not benefit from estrogen's bone-, cardio-, neuro-, and breast-protective effects.

### Estradiol level and menopause… [^114fYT88]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Accompanying ArticleFree accessCORRESPONDENCEReply to A. Y. Lin To the Editor: Papakonstantinou et al. 1described a 36-year-old premenopausal woman who was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer. The patient received adjuvant therapy with three cycles of anthracycline-cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy, followed by three cycles of taxane chemotherapy, then locoregional radiotherapy, and concluded with adjuvant endocrine therapy. While on endocrine therapy with goserelin and an aromatase inhibitor, despite experiencing menopausal symptoms, the patient's serum estradiol level was 16 pg/mL, higher than the 15 pg/mL cutoff for biochemical menopausal status. Due to the high-risk status of her disease, not defined in the article, she was recommended to have an ovarian ablation and continue the aromatase inhibitor therapy. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea is well documented, but is not the biochemical definition of menopause.

2, 3The degree of amenorrhea differs by patients' age and type of chemotherapeutic regimens — two major risk factors. 2Data suggest that higher doses and longer duration of chemotherapy regimens may result in greater risk for chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. 3Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and/or estradiol resulted in inaccurately labeled menopausal status in about one third of patients. 3As Torino et al reported, estradiol and inhibin B are not reliable methods to monitor ovarian function during perimenopausal status. Furthermore, they acknowledged, "it remains unproven that such monitoring will identify which patients will or will not benefit from GnRHa and AI treatment and that neither the ideal time points for monitoring nor the standardized laboratory criteria have been established".

3Given that estradiol itself is not a reliable biomarker for menopausal status, the validity of the proposed algorithm based on the patient's estradiol level is questionable. Even if the highly sensitive estradiol level is a reliable measurement of postmenopausal status, it is worth considering whether the patient's elevated estradiol level, at least in part, is due to not receiving the full dose or the standard regimen of anthracycline-cyclophosphamide followed by taxane. 4.

### Premenopausal endogenous oestrogen levels and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis [^114XU9Hp]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many of the established risk factors for breast cancer implicate circulating hormone levels in the aetiology of the disease. Increased levels of postmenopausal endogenous oestradiol (E2) have been found to increase the risk of breast cancer, but no such association has been confirmed in premenopausal women. We carried out a meta-analysis to summarise the available evidence in women before the menopause.

Methods

We identified seven prospective studies of premenopausal endogenous E2 and breast cancer risk, including 693 breast cancer cases. From each study we extracted odds ratios of breast cancer between quantiles of endogenous E2, or for unit or s.d. increases in (log transformed) E2, or (where odds ratios were unavailable) summary statistics for the distributions of E2 in breast cancer cases and unaffected controls. Estimates for a doubling of endogenous E2 were obtained from these extracted estimates, and random-effect meta-analysis was used to obtain a pooled estimate across the studies.

Results

Overall, we found weak evidence of a positive association between circulating E2 levels and the risk of breast cancer, with a doubling of E2 associated with an odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

Conclusion

Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a positive association between premenopausal endogenous E2 and breast cancer risk.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^115mTG81]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis found that DHEA supplementation at doses of 50 mg/day or higher significantly increased testosterone levels, and in participants aged 60 years or older, significantly elevated estradiol levels. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess the effects of DHEA supplementation on both testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, providing a foundation for future interventions and clinical practice. Understanding the optimal DHEA dosage based on specific health conditions is essential to guide rational therapy for postmenopausal women.

### The unitary model for estrogen deficiency and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis: is a revision needed? [^1119vYS8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Studies in Men

In our original model, we proposed that declining bioavailable estrogen levels also made a substantial contribution to age-related bone loss in men. Considerable evidence since then provides strong support for this postulate, and interestingly, studies in men may provide insights into why trabecular and cortical bone may respond differently to estrogen and estrogen deficiency. Thus a number of observational studies now have demonstrated that serum estrogen levels are important determinants of bone mass and bone loss in men. Moreover, short-term interventional studies in which men are made hypogonadal and are selectively replaced either with estrogen or testosterone have demonstrated the importance of estrogen in regulating both bone formation and bone resorption in adult men.

There is also increasing evidence for a threshold for estrogen effects on bone in normal adult men. Indeed, it has been easier to tease out dose-response relationships between serum estradiol levels and bone turnover or bone mass in men, who span a range of estradiol levels that includes this apparent threshold; by contrast, premenopausal women are well above this threshold, whereas postmenopausal women are considerably below it, making it difficult to define the overall relationship between serum estradiol levels and bone metabolism. Thus studies using the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene have found that men with low endogenous estradiol levels (less than approximately 25 pg/mL) tend to have a decrease in bone-resorption markers, but men with endogenous estradiol levels above this value have the opposite response following raloxifene treatment — namely, an increase in bone resorption. Moreover, rates of bone loss and fracture risk seem to be highest in men with estradiol levels below approximately 20 to 25 pg/mL using immunoassays (or approximately 16 pg/mL using mass spectroscopy), and variations in estradiol levels above this range do not appear to be related to bone loss or fracture risk in aging men. However, studies using QCT also have provided evidence for differences in the dose relationships between serum estradiol levels and trabecular verus cortical bone. There appears to be a clear threshold for this relationship in cortical, but not in trabecular, bone, or at least the relationship between serum estradiol and cortical bone plateaus at much lower estradiol levels (Fig. 4 A) than the relationship between serum estradiol levels and trabecular bone (Fig. 4 B). Thus one possible explanation for ongoing trabecular bone loss throughout life in women and men may be that trabecular bone is intrinsically less sensitive to estrogen than cortical bone in terms of all the pleiotropic effects of estrogen in maintaining bone mass. As such, trabecular bone loss occurs even in the setting of "normal" estrogen levels in young-adult life, whereas cortical bone is maintained until the onset of estrogen deficiency following menopause or age-related decreases in bioavailable estrogen levels late in life in men.

### Challenges in developing accurate assays for the measurement of estradiol and testosterone in postmenopausal women [^116rQHVV]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Circulating concentrations of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) have been measured in postmenopausal women for many years, predominantly by immunoassays and mass spectrometry (MS) assays. Although the accuracy of E2 and T assays is very important to provide clinically meaningful results, there are challenges in establishing their accuracy. MS assays demonstrate higher accuracy for steroid hormone measurements, but immunoassays can provide clinically meaningful results, especially at high concentrations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established a program to standardize and improve the measurement of steroid hormones, including E2 and T, using liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS). In addition, the CDC has partnered to establish postmenopausal reference ranges for T and is developing reference intervals for E2. Minimizing some of the technical limitations of the current immunoassays and MS assays should provide better and more accurate assays for patient care.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^11477V6b]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study provides novel insight into the range and interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting. Our data suggest that up to one in four women may need off-label doses to achieve therapeutic levels. Blood tests are not needed to diagnose menopause in women over the age of 45, because the diagnosis is clinical; and blood tests are not helpful to diagnose perimenopause, because estrogen levels fluctuate considerably. Blood tests cannot be used to inform dose decisions when levels are in the therapeutic range, because there is substantial intraindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration and clinical effect (pharmacodynamics). However, blood tests can be useful when the clinical response is suboptimal, especially in women using high licensed doses (4 PE), to determine whether a change in formulation or an off-label dose is likely to be of benefit. A blood test is also helpful when women with no or minimal menopausal symptoms want HT for bone protection, to confirm that levels are therapeutic (> 200 pmol/L).

Improved understanding of the substantial interindividual variation in estradiol pharmacokinetics facilitates dose customization based on clinical symptoms. Measurement of serum estradiol is useful to identify and guide dose customization in women who absorb transdermal estradiol poorly. Personalized care is key to prevent the immediate and long-term harms of estrogen deficiency.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^117B37bz]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our review of systemic absorption of estradiol with use of low-dose and ultralow-dose vaginal estrogen therapies found low to negligible amounts of circulating estradiol that may be influenced by product formulation and vaginal placement. This minimal systemic absorption of estradiol with proven efficacy of lower-dose products may be a relevant point when counseling postmenopausal women for the treatment of moderate to severe VVA symptoms. We also propose a more updated basal level of estradiol in normal, untreated postmenopausal women based on levels found in postmenopausal women who are not treated with any hormone therapy. A more accurate level will likely be established with the further standardization of estradiol assays designed to detect minimal amounts of estradiol such as those found in postmenopausal women.

Serum estradiol concentration

Serum estradiol levels are not routinely monitored in women prescribed HT. Blood tests were undertaken for the following reasons: to determine if estradiol levels were in the physiological range in women with a suboptimal clinical response; when there were menopausal symptoms that were difficult to distinguish from side effects such as bleeding or headaches; and/or at the patient's request for any reason.

Women consulted online or in-person. Blood tests were accessed via Nationwide Pathology, a private pathology provider with 250 phlebotomy clinics across the UK. Samples were either couriered or sent in tracked prepaid envelopes to Nationwide Pathology, Leicestershire, UK. Upon arrival, samples were processed immediately using the Atelica IM Enhanced Estradiol (eE2) assay as per the manufacturer's instructions.

The Atelica IM analyzer was calibrated twice daily using standard controls and underwent monthly external quality assurance. Detectable concentrations ranged from 40.95 to 10,410.00 pmol/L. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 2.7% to 7% and the uncertainty of measurement was 5.58%.

Research ethics and consent

Informed consent was obtained from all participants for their data to be used for the purpose of research and audit. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (UCL REC ID: 9093.008).

### Estradiol (vagifem) [^111j6FmW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Vagifem nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Uterine and vaginal effects of unopposed ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol [^111sXUP9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate uterine effects of unopposed ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol administered to postmenopausal women for 2 years.

Methods

Postmenopausal women (n = 417), aged 60–80 years, with a uterus and with bone mineral density that was normal for age (z score ≥ -2.0) were randomly assigned to receive unopposed transdermal estradiol (14 microg per day) or identical placebo patch. We evaluated effects on endometrial histology, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal epithelial cell maturation.

Results

At baseline, estradiol and placebo groups were similar in age (67 ± 5 years) and in median baseline serum estradiol level (4.8 pg/mL, interquartile range 2.7, 8.0 pg/mL). In the estradiol group, median estradiol level increased to 8.6 pg/mL, (interquartile range 4.4, 13.9 pg/mL, P < .001). In the estradiol group, focal atypical endometrial hyperplasia developed in 1 woman, and adenosarcoma of the uterus developed in 1 woman. The placebo group had no endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial proliferation occurred in 8.5% of the estradiol group and in 1.1% of the placebo group (P = 0.06). Incidence of vaginal bleeding was 12.4% in the estradiol group and 8.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.3). Vaginal epithelial cells showed greater maturation in the estradiol group than in the placebo group (P < .001) but less than typically observed with standard doses of estrogen.

Conclusion

During 2 years of treatment with ultralow-dose unopposed estradiol, treatment and placebo groups had similar rates of endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial proliferation, and vaginal bleeding. This therapy apparently causes little or no endometrial stimulation.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^114w3JnQ]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

We defined a high level as > 2,051 pmol/L based on the reference range observed in the whole cohort (2.5% of women had levels > 2,051 pmol/L). It should be emphasized that this is an arbitrary threshold that has no clinical meaning and was used purely to interrogate the relationship between dose and high levels. There was no evidence that use of off-label versus on-label doses increased the odds of a high level (P = 0.14). Higher levels were more frequently observed in younger women with higher, fluctuating endogenous estradiol levels, and in gel users with higher peak levels versus patch users, but the associations failed to reach significance at the 5% level.

Some women attending a specialist clinic use high doses to achieve high levels for therapeutic effect. For example, psychological symptoms in the menopause transition are common and can be effectively treated with HT +/− additional psychiatric support.- Limited evidence suggests that some women with severe depressive symptoms need higher estradiol levels for symptom relief. Occasionally, high doses are used to suppress ovulation in perimenopausal women with severe symptoms resulting from excessive, unpredictable hormone fluctuations. In younger women with distressing cyclical symptoms, cycle suppression is usually achieved using a combined contraceptive pill. Most combined oral contraceptives contain 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol, which is roughly dose-equivalent to a 300-mcg 17β-estradiol patch twice weekly, or 12 pumps 17β-estradiol gel daily. If using HT to suppress ovulation in perimenopausal women, 2x 100-mcg estradiol patches (200 mcg) twice weekly are usually sufficient, but higher doses may be needed in younger women and/or poor absorbers.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^117FDvfH]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Almost two-thirds of women (61.87%) were using licensed doses of up to four pumps gel daily or equivalent (4 PE); just over a third (37.27%) were using higher off-label doses. The median dose was four PE (IQR 3.00–6.00).

The distribution of serum estradiol concentration was positively skewed with a mean concentration of 544.59 pmol/L (SD 682.55 pmol/L) and a median concentration of 355.26 pmol/L (IQR 198.44–646.15 pmol/L) (Supplemental Fig. 2). The reference range (the interval between the 2.5th and 97.5th centile) for the whole cohort was 54.62–2,050.55 pmol/L. When stratified by menopause status, the reference range for perimenopausal transdermal estradiol users was 88.54–3,151.62 pmol/L, and the range for postmenopausal transdermal estradiol users was 42.47–1,817.27 pmol/L. The reference ranges in women using only licensed doses (1–4 PE) were as follows: perimenopausal women 84.50–3,100.88 pmol/L and postmenopausal women 40.95–1,664.54 pmol/L (Supplemental Table 2).

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113PJVfn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Half of women who are postmenopausal have genitourinary discomfort after menopause. Recommended therapies include low-dose vaginal estrogen. Individuals with a history of breast cancer or venous thromboembolism may have concerns about the safety of this intervention.

Objective

To compare serum estrogen concentrations with the use of vaginal estrogen, 10 μg, tablet vs placebo in women who are postmenopausal.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a secondary, post hoc analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of treatment for moderate to severe genitourinary syndrome in women who are postmenopausal. The study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and the University of Minnesota from April 11, 2016, to April 23, 2017. Measurements and data analysis were performed from November 3, 2020, to September 23, 2022.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to vaginal estradiol tablet (10 μg/d for 2 weeks and then twice weekly) plus placebo gel (3 times weekly) or dual placebo for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

In this post hoc analysis, baseline and week 12 serum estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured by a chemiluminescent assay. Week 12 values of the 3 analytes were compared by baseline participant characteristics. Linear models compared week 12 estradiol concentrations between treatment groups, adjusted for baseline characteristics.

Results

A total of 174 women, mean (SD) age 61 (4) years, were included. Those in the estrogen group (n = 88) were more likely to have higher geometric mean (SD) week 12 serum estradiol concentrations (4.3[2.2 pg/mL]) than those in the placebo group (n = 86) (3.5 [2.1] pg/mL) (P = 0.01). Adjusted for pretreatment hormone concentrations, age, clinical site, and body mass index, assignment to the estrogen vs placebo treatment group was significantly associated with higher week 12 estradiol concentrations (23.8% difference; 95% CI, 6.9%-43.3%). Most (121 of 174 [69.5%]) participants had enrollment serum estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL. Of women starting treatment at estradiol levels lower than or equal to 2.7 pg/mL, 38.1% (8 of 21) in the estrogen group and 34.4% (11 of 32) in the placebo group had estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL after 12 weeks of study participation (P = 0.78). Treatment assignment was not associated with week 12 estrone or SHBG concentrations.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, a significant, although small, increase in serum estradiol levels was noted after 12 weeks of vaginal estrogen administration. The clinical relevance of this small increase is uncertain.

### High prevalence of increased interleukin-17A serum levels in postmenopausal estrogen deficiency [^115s6N6N]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Postmenopausal estrogen deficiency is associated with chronic inflammatory events that cause cardiovascular and osteoporosis diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between interleukin (IL)-17 and serum estradiol levels, age, and postmenopausal duration, as well as bone loss.

Methods

The relationship between serum IL-17A and estradiol levels was studied in 72 postmenopausal women and 22 premenopausal women. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence were used to detect IL-17A and estradiol, respectively.

Results

Estradiol levels were significantly higher and IL-17A levels were significantly lower in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women (estradiol: 239.44 [226.17] vs 74.21 [4.44] pmol/L, P < 0.0001; IL-17A: 2.88 [0.08] vs 3.5 [0.56] ng/mL, P < 0.0001). Seventy-eight of 94 women had lower estradiol levels (< 83 pmol/L) with elevated IL-17A levels, in comparison with 16 women who had normal estrogen levels (3.43 [0.56] vs 3.01 [0.38] ng/mL, P < 0.0001). IL-17A levels inversely correlated with the total lumbar T-scores calculated in all women (P < 0.0001). IL-17A levels showed age-related dependency and a remarkable association with the postmenopausal period (P < 0.03).

Conclusions

The results demonstrate a high prevalence of increased serum IL-17A levels in postmenopausal estrogen deficiency, which can play an inducing role in chronic inflammatory events such as bone loss.

### Metabolic characterization of menopause: cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence [^116A6UXL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with a decrease in estradiol, beginning during the transition phase (~2 years before a woman's final menstrual period), with levels plateauing at a low value by ~2 years post-menopause, and a mirror pattern of increasing follicle stimulating hormone levels over the same period. The metabolic changes observed here may, thus, reflect sex and gonadotropin hormonal changes relating to the menopausal transition. Previous studies have shown exogenous estrogen alone, or in combination with progestogens [as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or combined hormonal contraception], is associated with a variation in lipid levels. Of relevance to our findings, post-menopausal women using HRT were found to have lower LDL cholesterol in comparison with those not using HRT. However, these associations with exogenous hormones may not be causal, and it remains unclear to what extent HRT is associated with levels of non-lipid biomarkers, e.g. fatty acids and amino acids. Several studies have recently found exogenous hormones and also reproductive-status change, including pregnancy and menopause (as studied here) to be associated with changes in a wide range of circulating metabolites. Further research to understand the relationship between circulating levels of reproductive hormones at different stages of the life course and changes in comprehensive metabolic profiles would be important in giving us a better understanding of the extent to which sex hormones influence metabolism during different reproductive stages of life.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^115gbyGT]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to measure the range and interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration in women treated with transdermal estradiol, and to estimate the prevalence of "poor absorbers" (women using licensed doses with subtherapeutic levels). To our knowledge, this is the largest study to measure hormone levels in women using transdermal estradiol, and the first to include both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, using both licensed and off-label doses, in a real-world clinic setting.

The median estradiol level was 355.26 pmol/L (IQR 198.44–646.15 pmol/L) in keeping with data that suggest the optimal level for symptom relief is around 400 pmol/L for most women.

The reference range for serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal HT users attending a private menopause clinic was 54.62–2,050.55 pmol/L (14.88–558.53 pg/mL). This is wider than the physiological reference range in premenopausal women (110–1,300 pmol/L or 30–350 pg/mL). In premenopausal women, preovulatory estradiol levels typically peak at 550 to 1,300 pmol/L, but values of up to 2,750 pmol/L have been reported. Estradiol levels can be up to 30% higher in perimenopausal women due to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and/or luteal-out-of-phase events. An additive effect will be observed in women using exogenous estrogen (HT). This accounts for the wide range in serum estradiol concentration in the study cohort, especially in perimenopausal women (88.54–3,151.62 pmol/L), and illustrates the importance of not relying on blood tests to diagnose perimenopause or to guide HT (estradiol) dose decisions.

### Diastolic dysfunction and sex-specific progression to HFpEF: current gaps in knowledge and future directions [^113ib832]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Menopause and estrogen levels

The incidence of cardiovascular disease steeply increases in all women after menopause. An early menopause increases the risk of ischemic heart disease risk, and of HF. For each year that natural menopause is delayed, the annual risk of cardiovascular death decreases by 2%, and the annual risk of ischemic heart disease decreases by 3%. One hypothesis is that this post-menopausal rise in cardiovascular disease incidence is attributable to a decline in estrogen levels. Estrogens are the primary female sex hormones and have been proposed to protect the heart from various forms of stress, including cytotoxic, ischemic, and hypertrophic stimuli. In the 1990s, the landmark Women's Health Initiative trial was conducted to investigate whether the protective effects of estrogens would be recovered when administering estradiol, or estradiol and progestin, to women without or with a history of hysterectomy, respectively. This research was terminated because women taking hormone replacement therapy showed an excess risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer and no protective effects on cardiovascular endpoints. However, small benefits were observed in "young" participants aged 50–59 years. Afterwards, the timing hypothesis was brought up, which states that only peri-menopausal women benefit from estradiol replacement, as these women still have less severe atherosclerotic plaques compared to post-menopausal women in which estrogen administration would increase the risk of damage to the already vulnerable plaque. Some supporting evidence came from post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials, but criticism was raised because of incomparable baseline characteristics. Recently, the follow-up findings of women that were temporarily randomized to use post-menopausal hormone therapy or placebo were published. There was no difference in the incidence of first HF hospitalization between the placebo and intervention arms, also not when stratifying for HFpEF and HFrEF. In another, observational, study among women aged ≥ 45 years, a higher baseline estradiol level protected for HFrEF development (HR per SD increase in estradiol level = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.93)), but not for HFpEF, during > 12-year follow-up. Potentially, these protective effects are mediated through ischemic heart disease, which is still the main cause of HFrEF.

### Neuroendocrine physiology of the early and late menopause [^115sAczp]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Hormonal integration of the reproductive system is dramatically affected by reproductive aging. The progressive loss of ovarian follicles with normal aging is accompanied by an initial decrease in inhibin B and a concomitant increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. Subsequently, inhibin A and progesterone decrease, where as estradiol levels are maintained and often increase. In the late reproductive stage, cycles remain regular whereas the early and late menopausal transition are characterized by irregular cycles and often dramatic swings in estradiol and gonadotropin levels. Studies in younger and older postmenopausal women suggest that there are age-related changes in the neuroendocrine axis that are independent of the changing ovarian hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition but may contribute to the end of reproductive life.

To propose a current, clinically relevant value for systemic estradiol in normal, healthy postmenopausal women, we examined estradiol levels from postmenopausal women in clinical trials administered either vaginal estrogens or vaginal DHEA that reported estradiol levels from the placebo group or at baseline, and untreated, control postmenopausal women in vaginal therapy trials (with or without VVA). Data from postmenopausal women in assay validation studies are also reviewed. Only studies that used detection methods involving gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) with MS were summarized for this purpose.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^113x87mc]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration

Median estradiol levels increased from 191.30 pmol/L (IQR 100.62–303.37 pmol/L) in women using one PE to 334.32 pmol/L (IQR 202.12–567.85 pmol/L) in women using four PE (the maximum licensed dose), and 505.30 pmol/L (IQR 275.28–907.40 pmol/L) in women using eight PE (Supplemental Table 3).

There was considerable interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration (Fig. 1). Low (< 2.5th centile) and high (> 97.5th centile) levels were observed in every dose category excluding 7 PE (n = 33). Variance was greater in younger versus older women (P = 0.002), perimenopausal versus postmenopausal women (P < 0.0001), and gel versus patch users (P = 0.002). There was a trend toward greater variance in women using higher doses, but the trend failed to reach statistical significance at the 5% level (P = 0.074) (Supplemental Table 4).

FIG. 1
Relationship between log transformed serum estradiol concentration and estradiol dose for the whole cohort (N = 1,508). Dose was treated as a categorical variable to allow for nonlinearity, and because it was not possible to extrapolate beyond the licensed dose range. For example, one pump equivalent (PE) equates to one pump of 0.06% gel daily, or a 25-mcg patch twice weekly. Red diamonds represent the mean serum estradiol concentration per dose category. Blue, yellow, gray, and red dots represent levels within one, two, three, and four standard deviations from the mean, respectively.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^1159nshR]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our updated review of the medical literature found that systemic absorption of estradiol with low-dose and ultralow-dose vaginal estrogen therapies is very low, varies by the product dose, and may be influenced by the product formulation and placement in the vagina. Higher absorption was reported with higher vaginal estradiol doses (25 μg: 7.1–22.7 pg/mL, 10 μg: 4.6–14.8 pg/mL) compared with the lowest available dose of 4 μg (3.6–3.9 pg/mL). -, We also propose a more updated, although conservative, basal or baseline (untreated/before treatment) range of estradiol levels in normal, untreated postmenopausal women, mostly with VVA, measured in vaginal-therapy clinical trials by highly specific and sensitive LC or GC/MS/MS assays.

### Workshop on normal reference ranges for estradiol in postmenopausal women, September 2019, Chicago, Illinois [^117ED91R]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) organized the Workshop on Normal Ranges for Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women from September 23 to 24, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois. The aim of the workshop was to review existing analytical methodologies for measuring estradiol in postmenopausal women and to assess existing data and study cohorts of postmenopausal women for their suitability to establish normal postmenopausal ranges. The anticipated outcome of the workshop was to develop recommendations for establishing normal ranges generated with a standardized and certified assay that could be adopted by clinical and research communities. The attendees determined that the term reference range was a better descriptor than normal range for estradiol measurements in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight speakers presented during the workshop.

Estradiol concentration: low and high levels

Low (subtherapeutic) estradiol levels were defined clinically as < 200 pmol/L. - In the whole cohort (N = 1,508), 378 women (25.07%) had low levels. Two hundred ninety-six of 933 women (31.73%) using licensed doses (1–4 PE) had estradiol levels of < 200 pmol/L, including 116 of 467 women (24.84%) using the highest licensed dose (4 PE), compared with 82 of 562 women (14.59%) using off-label doses (Fig. 3, Supplemental Table 7).

FIG. 3
The percentage of women with low estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L) in each dose category. Dose (number of pump equivalents, PE) was treated as a categorical variable. The number of women with low or subtherapeutic levels (< 200 pmol/L) decreases as the dose increases, but up to 1 in four women using the maximum licensed dose (4 PE) have low levels, and around 1 in 6 women using high off-label doses (5–8 PE) have low levels.

Invasive breast cancer — definition of menopause and diagnostic criteria state that menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis, and is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea; natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 years. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact or may resume over time, with the likelihood of resuming after chemotherapy higher among those aged < 40 years. Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression; FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause, and FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy; Age ≥ 60 years; Age < 60 with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range; Age < 60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments; Age < 60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range. Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^114W7sTU]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Several vaginal estrogen preparations are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women. Guidelines published by relevant medical societies recommend vaginal estrogen use for moderate to severe symptomatic VVA unresponsive to nonprescription therapies, especially in women without other menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. - Published data indicate that low-dose vaginal estrogens minimally increase plasma estradiol and clearly not to levels observed with oral or transdermal estrogen products. Use of vaginal estrogens has increased since publication of the results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), - presumably from concerns about the adverse effects of increased systemic estrogen levels. Notably, local administration of vaginal estrogens minimizes systemic estrogen exposure, compared with that of oral or transdermal estrogens. Data from the observation study of WHI showing no increase in cancer or cardiovascular risk with vaginal estrogens are consistent with these ideas.

Despite existing data on low systemic estradiol levels with vaginal estrogens, some surveyed postmenopausal women are hesitant to use vaginal estrogen products because of the potential of systemic absorption, with possible resultant side effects, universally described in the product packaging of all estrogen products for menopause, as a result of US FDA class labeling. A review of serum levels of estradiol after various doses and formulations of locally administered vaginal estrogens was previously performed. Collectively, the reviewed data demonstrated that systemic absorption of estradiol was dose-dependent with lower systemic levels resulting from use of lower vaginal estrogen doses, and that highly specific assays detected lower levels of estradiol because of minimal amounts of cross-reacting substances.

In this current review, we extend the previous review of estradiol levels of various vaginal estrogen formulations by dose and assay, and describe the challenges associated with measuring serum estradiol levels accurately. This review also allows us to estimate the normal range of circulating estradiol in postmenopausal women not being treated with exogenous estradiol based on measuring estradiol levels with mass spectrometry (MS) — a highly sensitive, and increasingly available, assay methodology.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^113R9shJ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Accurately measuring estradiol levels in serum is challenging for many reasons. An Endocrine Society Statement noted that our ability to measure sex steroids properly has not kept pace with their increasing importance in clinical medicine and research. Analytical sensitivity and specificity at low concentrations of estradiol are needed for accurate measurement of estradiol levels, especially for postmenopausal women and women taking aromatase inhibitors. Over the years, methods for measuring estradiol levels from serum have evolved. Early assays involved estradiol extraction, column chromatography, and measurement by RIA and then later, by direct RIAs utilizing buffers that release albumin- and SHBG-bound estradiol. Most recently, extraction followed by chromatography and MS has been used. While advantages of immunoassays include eliminating the need for estradiol extraction, reducing costs, and increasing sample throughput, cross-reactivity with immunoassays make them unsuitable for detection of estradiol in patient populations with low estradiol concentrations. In addition, RIAs required labor-intensive extractions, handling of radioactive material, and artifact from nonspecific binding to radioactivity. Analytical methods such as LC or GC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) are now being used more frequently for clinical samples as they have overcome some of the sensitivity and specificity limitations with RIAs, even MS assays have variability between different assays. Varying levels of estradiol are reported when using assays with different cross-reactivities and specificities, particularly when comparing samples measured by RIA and LC/MS or GC/MS. More specific assays (ie, LC or GC with MS) have less cross-reactivity with other steroidal-like molecules and typically yield lower estradiol values than less specific assays with inherently greater cross-reactivities (ie, RIA or ELISA). Our current review is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that many of the most recently developed highly specific assays can detect or quantify systemic estradiol as low as 0.1 to 2.7 pg/mL using LC/MS/MS or LC/MS, -,- and 1 to 5 pg/mL using GC/MS/MS or GC/MS. Indeed, the goal of sensitivity has been to develop assays detecting < 5 pg/mL of estradiol for measuring estradiol in serum of postmenopausal women. Detecting estradiol levels near the lower limit of detection in postmenopausal women may be important in determining their risk for fracture.

### Ultralow-dose estradiol and BMD in postmenopausal women… [^112NBBDt]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, the recommended treatment for menopausal symptoms is the shortest regimen and lowest possible dosage of postmenopausal hormone therapy. The estimated minimum dosage of estrogen necessary to preserve bone mass is based on studies of young women who have undergone oophorectomy. However, these estimates may be too high for post-menopausal women, because even low levels of endogenous plasma estradiol can increase bone density and reduce fracture risk in this group. Ettinger and colleagues studied the effect of an ultralow dosage of transdermal estradiol on bone density and endometrial hyperplasia in post-menopausal women. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at nine clinical centers in the United States. The 600 women who participated in the trial were 60 to 80 years of age, had a uterus, and were at least five years past menopause.

Normal bone mineral density was required, but women who used antiosteoporosis medications or had undergone recent hormone therapy were excluded. The intake assessment included breast and pelvic examinations, Papanicolaou smear, endometrial aspiration sampling, mammography, BMD assessment of the lumbar spine and hip, and extensive laboratory testing. Data on the patient's medical history, health habits, and medication use also were gathered. After intake assessment, 209 patients were randomized to receive placebo and 208 patients were randomized to receive an estradiol patch in a dosage of 0. 014 mg per day for two years. All patients received daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The authors assessed adverse effects and compliance at four-month follow-up visits, and endometrial biopsies were attempted annually. The primary outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia and change in lumbar spine BMD at two years.

Secondary outcomes included incidence of fractures and biochemical markers of bone turnover. The authors conclude that ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol therapy successfully improves BMD without increasing endometrial hyperplasia or inducing breast pathology in postmenopausal women. They advocate redefining estrogen "deficiency" in this age group to levels closer to 5 to 10 pg per mL instead of the 50 to 200 pg per mL recommended for premenopausal women.

Estradiol Measurements

We only included measurements from the blood samples that were collected during the participants initial visit to the assessment center. Estradiol had been measured by 2-step competitive analysis on a Beckman Coulter Unicel Dxl 800. This assay had a lower detection limit of 175 pmol/L. Normal ranges of serum estradiol levels are known to be 36.7 to 183.6 pmol/L in men, 73.4 to 2753.5 pmol/L in premenopausal women, and 0 to 73.4 pmol/L in postmenopausal women. This results in a large fraction of the participants, especially men and postmenopausal women, having levels below detection limit. Among the UKB participants, 76 668 had estradiol measurements above detection limit. Estradiol levels were therefore analyzed as a binary phenotype (above/below detection limit) in our primary analyses, in contrast to a previous GWAS for estradiol, which excluded all individuals below detection limit. However, we also performed sensitivity analyses using the Tobit model where quantitative measures (for those above detection limit) are modeled together with the below-detection-limit samples.

GWAS and Sensitivity Analyses

GWAS was performed in males and females separately, using logistic regression with an additive genetic model implemented in PLINK version 2. The following covariates were included in both male and female analyses: age, body mass index, the first 10 genetic principal components (to adjust for population structures and ethnic origins), and a binary indicator variable for UKB Axiom vs UK BiLEVE genotyping array to adjust for any array differences. For females, hormone replacement therapy (current, ever, or never), oral contraceptive use (current, ever, or never), number of live births, menopausal status, and whether they have undergone hysterectomy were also included. Women who were unsure about menopausal status were excluded. Information for the covariates were collected from the initial visit to the assessment center, which was the same time as the blood sample for the estradiol measurements were taken.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Estradiol gel 0.1%

Read this Patient Information leaflet before you start using estradiol gel 0.1% and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment.

What is estradiol gel 0.1%?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is a prescription medicine that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone). Estradiol gel 0.1% is a clear, colorless, smooth gel that is odorless when dry. When applied to the skin, estradiol is absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.

What is estradiol gel 0.1% used for?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is used after menopause to:

Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes

Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^117R2PKf]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Almost a third of women (32%) using licensed doses (1–4 PE) had subtherapeutic serum estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L). The odds of having a low level were significantly higher among older women (≥ 50 y) and patch users. Overall, approximately one in two women using one or two PE, one in three women using three PE, and one in four women using four PE (the highest licensed dose) had low levels. This suggests that up to one in four women may need a higher off-label dose to achieve therapeutic levels. This is higher than the 5%-20% prevalence reported previously, possibly because our data was collected in the real world and is therefore subject to greater variation. Prescribing off-label doses when clinically indicated is consistent with menopause guidelines that do not set arbitrary limits on estrogen dose, but recommend that the dose is individualized to achieve treatment goals (symptom relief and/or bone protection). - Notably, although the odds of having a low level were 2.73-fold higher in women using licensed doses, around one in six women using off-label doses (≥ 5 PE) also had subtherapeutic levels. These women may be more likely to benefit from a change in formulation, but patient preference is key to optimize adherence, and HT stock shortages may limit choice.

### Estradiol and progesterone (bijuva) [^114hBoBx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Endogenous progesterone is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium.

Progesterone enhances cellular differentiation and generally opposes the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progesterone exerts its effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to BIJUVA nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Association between menopause age and estradiol-based hormone therapy with cognitive performance in cognitively normal women in the CLSA [^112PtDQK]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Menopause is associated with reductions in ovarian hormones and with various brain changes, including an increase in estrogen receptor (ER) density across certain regions. Estrogens play a critical role in cognition and neuroplasticity. Therefore, the menopausal transition is an important period for cognitive and brain changes.

The menopausal transition is generally associated with reductions in episodic memory performance, but equivocal findings in working memory performance, which may be due to the brain region recruited during the memory test, and/or menopause-related characteristics, such as age or type of menopause. Earlier age at menopause is associated with greater cognitive decline, increased dementia risk, and greater Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology compared with a later age at menopause. Other dementia risk factors may interact with age at menopause to increase AD risk, such as APOE ε4, the greatest genetic risk factor of late-onset sporadic AD. Together, these findings suggest that menopause age can influence brain health and should be investigated in the context of evaluating interventions such as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).

MHT typically consists of exogenous estrogens and progestogens to treat menopause-related symptoms. However, its efficacy in protecting against cognitive symptoms remains debated.MHT comes in varied forms that likely exert different effects on the brain and cognition, depending on composition of hormones and administration routes. Estradiol (E2, greatest potency) and estrone (E1) decline significantly over the course of the menopausal transition, with E1 levels exceeding E2 levels after menopause.E2 dose-dependently influences neuroplasticity and certain cognitive domains in both animal models and human female individuals, including spatial and nonspatial working memory and verbal memory. However, E1 can reduce hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognition depending on dose. These findings suggest that MHT formulations, which vary by estrogen type and dose, may influence cognition differently.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^111rzcTG]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Textbooks report peak normal levels of serum estradiol as ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL in postmenopausal women; however, these values were established in older studies with less specific assays, such as RIAs, and should be revised with values from studies using more specific and sensitive assays with less cross-reactivities. Here we reviewed the systemic estradiol levels that we believe would best represent those of normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Mean estradiol levels from those studies were used to calculate a mean basal level (3.9 pg/mL), with the range of basal estradiol levels for the normal, untreated postmenopausal woman found to be undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL using the 95% CI from the highest published SD (± 3.4). Thus, we propose a more current, sensitive mean level of circulating estradiol in normal, untreated women to range from undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL, which we believe to be more accurate than the well-accepted earlier level of ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL; yet it is still only an estimate.

An important principle is that assay methods for serum estradiol assessment need to be standardized to be able to accurately, systematically, and consistently measure the low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women. A single estradiol standard that can be traceable for each biological fluid in which estradiol is measured is needed, although some of the larger commercial laboratories have made strides to overcoming this obstacle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory/Manufacturer Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program, endorsed by 14 medical societies, was initiated in 2014 to help provide more accurate and precise hormone measurements used in patient care and research. The program assesses laboratory methodology and performance by comparing laboratory's specimen measurements with those of their reference LC/MS/MS method. Progress towards developing accurate, sensitive, and specific assays to measure the very low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women continues.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose for the indication.

1. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.

Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3-month to 6-month intervals. The usual initial dosage range is 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms. The minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration. Administration should be cyclic (e.g., 3 weeks on and 1 week off).

2. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.

Treatment is usually initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol, adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms; the minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration.

3. For treatment of breast cancer, for palliation only, in appropriately selected women and men with metastatic disease.

Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily for a period of at least three months.

4. For treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate, for palliation only.

Suggested dosage is 1 to 2 mg three times daily. The effectiveness of therapy can be judged by phosphatase determinations as well as by symptomatic improvement of the patient.

5. For prevention of osteoporosis.

When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should be considered only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom non-estrogen medications are not considered to be appropriate.

The lowest effective dose of estradiol has not been determined.

### Effects of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol on bone mineral density: a randomized clinical trial [^117VoRPw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Because small increments in levels of endogenous plasma estradiol are associated with higher postmenopausal bone mineral density, we investigated the safety and effectiveness in preventing bone loss of unopposed, very-low-dose transdermal estradiol for postmenopausal women.

Methods

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with 2-year follow-up at 9 United States clinical centers. The study population comprised 417 postmenopausal women, aged 60–80 years, with intact uterus and bone mineral density z scores of -2.0 or higher, who were randomly assigned to receive either unopposed transdermal estradiol at 0.014 mg/d (n = 208) or placebo (n = 209). All participants received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density change was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; endometrial hyperplasia incidence was assessed by endometrial biopsy.

Results

Median plasma estradiol level in the estradiol group increased from 4.8 pg/mL at baseline to 8.5 pg/mL at 1 year (P < .001 versus baseline) and to 8.6 pg/mL at 2 years (P < .001 versus baseline) and was unchanged in the placebo group. Lumbar spine bone mineral density increased 2.6% in the estradiol group and 0.6% in the placebo group (between-group difference 2.0%, P < .001). Mean total hip bone mineral density increased 0.4% in the estradiol group and decreased 0.8% in the placebo group (between-group difference 1.2%, P < .001). Osteocalcin levels and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were lower in the estradiol group than the placebo group (P < .001 each). Endometrial hyperplasia developed in 1 woman in the estradiol group but in none of the placebo group (difference in 2-year rates 0.5%, 95% confidence interval 0–7.3%).

Conclusion

Postmenopausal treatment with low-dose, unopposed estradiol increased bone mineral density and decreased markers of bone turnover without causing endometrial hyperplasia.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^112BohK6]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimating a postmenopausal level of systemic estradiol

When attempting to estimate a more accurate basal estradiol level for normal, untreated postmenopausal women based on estradiol levels measured with more sensitive detection assays, several sources of serum estradiol measurements may be appropriate to use for basal levels of estradiol in such women. We collated mean serum estradiol levels from postmenopausal women from vaginal therapy trials that were measured at baseline, from those treated with placebo, or from those with or without VVA who were enrolled in studies as controls (Fig. 1). Because detection methods involving more recent MS methodology are more sensitive than RIA, only studies using GC/MS/MS or LC/MS/MS to measure serum estradiol in the above mentioned women were summarized (Fig. 1). We also summarized mean estradiol values from serum of postmenopausal women that were measured in GC/MS/MS and LC/MS/MS assay validation studies (Fig. 1).

Systemic mean levels of estradiol appear to be consistent across postmenopausal women in these studies (Fig. 1). Mean estradiol levels in postmenopausal women measured at baseline in studies of vaginal estrogens or DHEA (including placebo groups) ranged from 2.9 to 4.9 pg/mL. - Levels of estradiol from untreated postmenopausal women with or without VVA who were used as controls in studies of vaginal DHEA similarly ranged from 3.7 to 4.1 pg/mL. Two randomized controlled studies of vaginal therapies in which women were treated with placebo also reported estradiol levels (at time-points other than baseline) ranging from 3.4 to 4.5 pg/mL. Postmenopausal women in these vaginal therapy studies were typically ≤ 75 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 38 kg/m 2 and a most bothersome symptom of moderate to severe vaginal pain associated with sexual activity (dyspareunia). - As women progress through their postmenopausal years, one would expect estradiol levels to diminish further. Consistent with this notion, one study in postmenopausal women reported means of 4.9 pg/mL in women < 5 years postmenopausal and 1.3 pg/mL in women > 5 years postmenopausal using a validated LC/MS/MS assay.

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to IMVEXXY nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112zy5LC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Many patients and health care professionals have concerns about the use of estrogen-containing therapies after menopause and do not distinguish between low-dose vaginal formulations and systemic hormone therapy. Definitively answering the question of whether low-dose vaginal estrogen preparations are safe would require a very large randomized clinical trial. However, our analysis, in combination with findings from multiple previous cohort studies, suggests that vaginal use of estrogen preparations does not substantially alter serum concentrations, and adds to the evidence that any changes in serum estrogen concentrations likely have limited clinical significance.

### Genome-wide association study of estradiol levels and the causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density [^111tKshK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

We performed MR analysis and estimated a causal effect of estradiol on BMD in males and, to our knowledge, for the first time also in females. Compared to previous studies in males, with not more than 5 SNPs as instruments for estradiol, we included as many as 16 SNPs in males and 4 in females. Interestingly, the effect estimate was higher for females than males in the 2-sample MR, which could agree with the fact that BMD decreases more rapidly in females by age. Estrogen can be used as a preventative treatment in postmenopausal women with low BMD to prevent osteoporosis, and our results were therefore not surprising.

One of the major strengths of this study is the large cohort from UKB with estradiol measurements available. However, only a subset of the participants had estradiol levels above detection limit. To increase the number of participants to analyze, we created a binary phenotype. Since normal levels of estradiol in males and postmenopausal women have a range below or just above the detection limit, we were not able to capture the full spectrum of individual variation in the cohort. However, we also used a second approach, Tobit-I modeling, which takes into account the quantitative measures for samples above detection limit without disregarding the values below detection limit. While this is a well-established method and frequently used (eg, in econometrics), it has not been widely used in genetic association studies. Here we showed that this approach results in similar P -values compared to the binary estradiol variable but provides quantitative effect estimates that are much easier to interpret. Since very few GWAS have been performed for estradiol previously, we only found studies with effects estimates on the quantitative scale for 1 of our GWAS signals: rs28892005 in the CYP19A6 locus [see Supplementary Table 2B in]. In previous studies, only SNPs in LD with our lead variants had been reported, but the absolute value of the effect sizes (β = 0.107, β = 0.065, and β = 0.062) were comparable to our Tobit model estimates for males (β = 0.106). While many clinical assays have a lower detection limit, we believe that the censored-regression approach using Tobit modeling should be useful for other studies as well. Also, in MR studies, the second MR assumption can be violated by dichotomizing the quantitative phenotype. The second MR assumption states that the IVs should be associated with the outcome only through the exposure. However, a change in the underlying quantitative exposure may effect a change in the outcome, without detectable change in the dichotomized, thereby violating this assumption. By re-estimating the causal effects of estradiol on BMD, using the quantitative effect estimates from the Tobit model, we could ensure that a potential violation of the second MR assumption did not dramatically influence our results.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^1121rGfH]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, younger women (< 50 y) and gel users were more likely to have high levels compared with older women (≥ 50 y) and patch users, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 5% level (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.93–4.65, P = 0.06; and OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.96–4.41, P = 0.07, respectively). There was no evidence of an association between a high estradiol concentration and on vs off-label dose (P = 0.14).

Supplemental Table 8 summarizes the characteristics of women with high levels (n = 38). Four PE was the dose most frequently prescribed for women with high levels (n = 11). The medical records of seven women with estradiol concentrations > 4,000 pmol/L were reviewed. All were clinically well at the time of blood sampling. The highest level was observed in a postmenopausal woman using an estradiol spray (1.53-mg estradiol per spray), six sprays daily (10,410 pmol/L, the upper limit of detection). This participant did not reattend for a repeat measurement during the study interval but was noted to have a serum level of 550.3 pmol/L 5 months earlier while using the same dose/formulation. Three perimenopausal gel users had levels > 7,000 pmol/L. One woman with a level of 7,969.9 pmol/L was advised to reduce her dose from six PE to four PE. A repeat test 6 weeks later revealed a level of 232.37 pmol/L. Two women using three PE of gel had levels > 7,000 pmol/L; the dose was unaltered and repeat tests during the study interval revealed levels of 96.05 pmol/L and 132 pmol/L. The highest level recorded in a patch user was 4,238.9 pmol/L in a postmenopausal woman using a 100-mcg patch (4 PE) twice weekly. The dose was unaltered and a repeat test 1 week later revealed an estradiol level of 80.68 pmol/L.
