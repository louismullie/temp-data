## Question

What is the recommended dosage for senna

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for senna, including dosing across different indications, populations, and safety considerations, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core adult constipation dosing from authoritative sources. Then, I should verify product-specific tablet strengths and labeled directions. Next, I will review chronic idiopathic constipation guidance and dose titration principles. After that, I need to consider special populations such as children, older adults, pregnancy, and opioid-induced constipation. I will then examine bowel preparation dosing and reconcile it with routine constipation therapy. Finally, I should review safety, monitoring, and weaning strategies, and close with a concise, practical dosing summary.

> Let me first confirm the foundational adult constipation dose. The FDA labeling consistently states sennosides 17.2 mg orally once daily for no longer than 1 week, with a general onset of 6–12 hours, which anchors the conservative, short-term approach for occasional constipation [^1141KcSW] [^116JvRL5] [^114ESJKu].

> Wait, let me verify product-specific tablet strengths and directions because many patients use OTC tablets. Most commercial senna tablets contain 8.6 mg sennosides per tablet, so 2 tablets equal 17.2 mg, aligning with the FDA dose; labels typically instruct adults and children 12 years and older to start with 2 tablets once daily, not to exceed 4 tablets twice daily, and to take preferably at bedtime, which matches both strength and timing expectations [^115BdF5G] [^1141KcSW] [^116mNSeu] [^1147nL4u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic use. I need to check guideline positions. The AGA-ACG guideline for chronic idiopathic constipation gives a conditional recommendation for senna and advises starting low and titrating based on response and tolerability, noting that trial doses were higher than commonly used in practice and that many participants required dose reductions due to cramping or diarrhea; this supports a titration strategy rather than a fixed chronic dose, with attention to adverse effects [^116sdzyj] [^114rMMwy] [^113vVaBL].

> I should confirm the trial dose that informs these recommendations. A randomized controlled trial used senna 1 g daily for 4 weeks and showed significant improvement in complete spontaneous bowel movements, but 83% of participants reduced their dose, underscoring the need to individualize and often use lower amounts in practice. Importantly, this 1 g dose is substantially higher than the 17.2 mg FDA-labeled dose, so clinical translation should be cautious and titration-based [^11289mdL] [^113FejR8].

> Let me consider older adults, because I need to ensure safety in this group. In geriatric settings, high-dose senna has been defined as more than 24 mg/day of sennosides, which can be a useful threshold when assessing tolerability and escalation; given increased sensitivity to cramping and electrolyte shifts, starting conservatively and reassessing frequently is prudent [^111NvwK1].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, and I need to be careful here. The FDA pregnancy guidance advises that sennosides should be used only if clearly needed, after safer options like fiber, docusate, or polyethylene glycol have failed, and use should be intermittent and under medical supervision. This means senna is not first-line in pregnancy and requires individualized risk–benefit discussion [^112P9rJi].

> I will now examine opioid-induced constipation, where prophylaxis is emphasized. Major guidelines recommend initiating a stimulant laxative such as senna at the start of chronic opioid therapy, often with or without docusate, and titrating to achieve a soft, formed bowel movement every 1–2 days without straining. Typical starting regimens cite senna 7.5 mg twice daily, with dose adjustments based on response and side effects [^113rvz7n] [^112fjcaE] [^112VG6kk] [^1154EVmS].

> But wait, what if the context is bowel preparation rather than routine constipation? I should double-check those regimens. For colonoscopy preparation, senna is used at much higher, short-course doses such as 24 tablets of 12 mg each divided into two doses, or in combination with reduced-volume PEG, which is effective but associated with more abdominal pain; these high-dose, time-limited regimens are not appropriate templates for chronic constipation management and should not be extrapolated to daily therapy [^114MBA5d] [^1139C5Qm] [^1146vYxz].

> Let me think about pediatric dosing, and I should confirm that adult tablet guidance does not directly translate. For children, OTC labels provide age-stratified starting doses such as 1 tablet once daily for ages 6–12 years and ½ tablet once daily for ages 2–6 years, with lower maxima, but expert pediatric guidance emphasizes PEG as first-line and reserves stimulants like senna for selected cases; pediatric protocols sometimes escalate senna into higher ranges under specialist supervision, but this requires individualized titration and monitoring for cramping and perineal skin effects [^1141KcSW] [^111TNXHu] [^114pWdtG] [^112NzDz5].

> I need to ensure safety and monitoring are addressed. Common adverse effects include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and urgency. Long-term concerns such as melanosis coli and enteric nerve injury are not well substantiated in humans at recommended doses, but electrolyte disturbances can occur, particularly with high or prolonged dosing. Labels advise not using beyond 1 week without clinician direction, and clinicians should reassess if there is rectal bleeding or no bowel movement after use, which may signal a more serious condition [^112KNLRA] [^113dWHsU] [^115sKf8z] [^113FJM2B].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical approach to chronic therapy and weaning. For patients who require ongoing therapy, a reasonable strategy is to start near the FDA-labeled dose, titrate to effect while minimizing cramping, and consider periodic attempts to reduce dose once stable; a pediatric weaning protocol demonstrated feasibility of 10–25% dose reductions every 2–6 weeks, which can be adapted conceptually to adults under supervision, with the understanding that many patients can successfully reduce or discontinue over time [^112TMFqG].

> Let me reconsider the overall dosing message to ensure internal consistency. For occasional constipation in adults, use 17.2 mg sennosides once daily for up to 1 week, preferably at bedtime, with an onset of 6–12 hours. For chronic idiopathic constipation, start low, titrate based on response and tolerability, and anticipate that many patients will require dose adjustments downward due to cramping or diarrhea. For opioid-induced constipation, initiate prophylactically and titrate to a goal of soft, formed stools every 1–2 days. Avoid applying bowel-preparation dosing to routine care, and use extra caution in older adults, pregnancy, and pediatrics with individualized plans and monitoring [^1141KcSW] [^116sdzyj] [^113rvz7n] [^114MBA5d] [^111NvwK1] [^112P9rJi] [^111TNXHu].

---

The recommended dose of senna for adults is **17.2 mg orally once daily at bedtime** [^116LyfEU] for no more than 1 week [^116JvRL5] without medical supervision. For chronic constipation, guidelines suggest starting at a lower dose and titrating based on response and tolerability [^116sdzyj] [^114rMMwy]; many trials used 1 g/day [^111Yurvw], but lower doses are often effective and better tolerated [^11289mdL]. Common adverse effects include abdominal cramping and diarrhea [^11289mdL]; **prolonged use without medical supervision is not recommended** [^113dWHsU].

---

## Recommended dosing for adults

- **Standard dose**: 17.2 mg orally once daily at bedtime [^116LyfEU] [^1141KcSW].
- **Duration**: Use for no more than 1 week without medical supervision [^116JvRL5] [^113dWHsU].
- **Maximum dose**: 4 tablets twice daily (total 68.8 mg/day) [^113vVaBL] [^116mNSeu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) provide **conditional recommendations** for senna in chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) [^116sdzyj] [^114rMMwy]. They advise starting at a lower dose and titrating based on response and tolerability [^116sdzyj]. Trials often used higher doses (e.g. 1 g/day) [^111Yurvw], but lower doses are generally better tolerated [^116sdzyj].

---

## Pediatric dosing recommendations

Pediatric dosing is **age-based** [^1141KcSW]:

| **Age group** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Children 6–12 years | 1 tablet once daily (8.6 mg) |
| Children 2–6 years | ½ tablet once daily (4.3 mg) |
| Children under 2 years | Consult a physician |

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Use only if clearly needed and under medical supervision [^112P9rJi].
- **Elderly**: Start at lower doses due to increased sensitivity [^notfound].
- **Opioid-induced constipation**: Senna is recommended as first-line therapy, often combined with osmotic laxatives [^113rvz7n] [^114iRsaC].

---

## Adverse effects and precautions

Common adverse effects include **abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and nausea** [^11289mdL]; **prolonged use** may cause melanosis coli (benign) [^112KNLRA] and electrolyte disturbances [^112KNLRA]. Patients should stop use and consult a physician if they experience rectal bleeding or fail to have a bowel movement after use [^113dWHsU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard adult dose**: 17.2 mg orally once daily at bedtime [^1141KcSW].
- **Maximum dose**: 4 tablets twice daily (68.8 mg/day) [^1141KcSW].
- **Duration**: No more than 1 week without medical supervision [^116mNSeu].
- **Chronic constipation**: Start low, titrate based on response and tolerability [^116sdzyj].
- **Pediatric dosing**: Age-based, consult a physician for children under 2 years [^1141KcSW].

---

Senna is effective for short-term constipation relief [^113FejR8]; **use the lowest effective dose** and monitor for adverse effects [^116sdzyj]. For chronic constipation, titrate to response and tolerability [^116sdzyj], and avoid prolonged unsupervised use [^113dWHsU].

### Laxatives for the management of constipation in palliative care patients [^1144zVJ5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a common problem for palliative care patients which can generate considerable suffering for patients due to both the unpleasant physical symptoms and psychological preoccupations that can arise. There is uncertainty about the 'best' management of constipation in palliative care patients and variation in practice between palliative care settings.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of laxative administration for the management of constipation in palliative care patients, and the differential efficacy of the laxatives used to manage constipation.

Search Strategy

We searched The Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue four, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to January 2005), CANCERLIT, PUBMED, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, SIGLE, NTIS, DHSS-DATA, Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings and NHS-NRR and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laxatives for constipation in palliative care patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted patient-reported data measuring changes in stool frequency and ease of passing stools, using objective and validated scales. Tolerance or adverse effects of laxatives used were also sought. The appropriateness of synthesizing data from the controlled trials depended upon the clinical and statistical homogeneity of studies identified. If the controlled trials were homogeneous, a meta-analysis would be attempted.

Main Results

Four trials involving 280 people were included. Between these trials, the laxatives lactulose; senna; danthron combined with poloxamer (Co-danthramer); Misrakasneham; magnesium hydroxide combined with liquid paraffin (Milpar) were evaluated. All four trials included number and frequency of bowel movements and relative ease of defecation as part of the assessment of laxative efficacy. All of the laxatives demonstrated a limited level of efficacy, although a significant number of participants required rescue laxatives in each of the studies. The only significantly different treatments were in the trial where lactulose plus senna were more effective than danthron combined with poloxamer. Patient preference did not favour either treatment option. Other related systematic reviews have similarly identified that there is a lack of evidence to support the use of one laxative, or combination of laxatives, over another.

Authors' Conclusions

The treatment of constipation in palliative care is based on inadequate experimental evidence, such that there are insufficient RCT data. Recommendations for laxative use can be related to costs as much as to efficacy. There have been few comparative studies, equally there have been few direct comparisons between different classes of laxative and between different combinations of laxatives. There persists an uncertainty about the 'best' management of constipation in this group of patients.

### Chronic constipation: an evidence-based review [^111rCUZ8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic constipation is a common condition seen in family practice among the elderly and women. There is no consensus regarding its exact definition, and it may be interpreted differently by physicians and patients. Physicians prescribe various treatments, and patients often adopt different over-the-counter remedies. Chronic constipation is either caused by slow colonic transit or pelvic floor dysfunction, and treatment differs accordingly.

Methods

To update our knowledge of chronic constipation and its etiology and best-evidence treatment, information was synthesized from articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Levels of evidence and recommendations were made according to the Strength of Recommendation taxonomy.

Results

The standard advice of increasing dietary fibers, fluids, and exercise for relieving chronic constipation will only benefit patients with true deficiency. Biofeedback works best for constipation caused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Pharmacological agents increase bulk or water content in the bowel lumen or aim to stimulate bowel movements. Novel classes of compounds have emerged for treating chronic constipation, with promising clinical trial data. Finally, the link between senna abuse and colon cancer remains unsupported.

Conclusions

Chronic constipation should be managed according to its etiology and guided by the best evidence-based treatment.

### Laxative weaning protocol for patients with functional constipation: a pilot study [^112TMFqG]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with functional constipation require prolonged laxative administration for proper emptying. Whether these laxatives can be weaned after better functioning is achieved is unknown. We aim to describe a standardized protocol for stimulant laxative weaning and its early outcomes.

Methods

Patients were candidates for weaning if they had been on a stable laxative dose for six months, defined as one bowel movement per day with no soiling, impaction, or enemas. Laxative dose was decreased by 10–25% with re-evaluation every two weeks. If patients remained well without constipation, dose was weaned further by 10–25%. If there were worsening of symptoms, lower dose was maintained for 3–6 months until re-evaluation.

Results

There were a total of sixteen patients evaluated. Median age was 12.7 years [IQR: 11.7–15.3] with laxative duration of 8.0 years [IQR: 5.4–10.7]. All patients were on senna; some were on fiber. Median starting senna dose was 71.3 mg [IQR: 54.3–75.0] and median fiber dose was 5.5 g [IQR: 4.0–6.0]. As of most recent follow up, nine patients (56.3%) had weaned off laxatives in 3.7 months [IQR: 1.3–11.6]. For those still on laxatives, median reduction in dose was 41.4 mg [30.0–75.0], and over half weaned their dose by > 50%. Almost all (90.9%) of those on high doses were able to wean.

Conclusion

A standardized laxative weaning process can be successful in patients with functional constipation, especially on high doses. Further prospective studies will be necessary to confirm the success of this protocol.

### Review article: do stimulant laxatives damage the gut? A critical analysis of current knowledge [^113mSLPd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Stimulant laxatives are well established as first- or second-line treatments for constipation and although they have a reliable therapeutic effect, alleged safety concerns still exist, particularly with long-term use. The potential harmful effects on the gastrointestinal system (including carcinogenicity) of the long-term use of diphenylmethane [bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate (SPS)] and senna stimulant laxatives were assessed in a comprehensive review of the publications identified in literature searches performed in PubMed and Embase up to and including June 2023. We identified and reviewed 43 publications of interest. While stimulant laxatives at supratherapeutic doses have been shown to cause structural alterations to surface absorptive cells in animals and humans, these effects are reversible and not considered clinically relevant. No formal long-term studies have demonstrated morphological changes in enteric neural elements or intestinal smooth muscle with bisacodyl or SPS in humans. Furthermore, there is no convincing evidence that stimulant laxatives are associated with the development of colon cancer, and in fact, chronic constipation itself has been reported to potentially increase the risk of colon cancer, therefore, the use of stimulant laxatives might reduce this risk. Many studies suggesting a possible harmful effect from laxatives were limited by their failure to consider confounding factors such as concomitant neurological disease, metabolic disorders, and age. These findings highlight the lack of evidence for the harmful effects of laxatives on the colon, and thus, the benefits of treatment with stimulant laxatives, even in the long-term, should be reconsidered for the management of patients with constipation.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^114uUknf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite docusate's wide use for constipation, there have been no new studies evaluating its efficacy. In the previous review, docusate had level III evidence and a grade C recommendation, based on trials that found docusate to be no more effective than placebo and significantly inferior to psyllium. Given the current literature or lack thereof, we are unable to provide a recommendation for docusate.

Overall, the OTC products analyzed in this review seemed to be safe and well tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse events, although some studies failed to report any adverse events. GI symptoms (abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and nausea) were the most common adverse events reported with a variable incidence for each product, and headache was the chief non-GI adverse event reported.

The limitations of our systematic review include that only studies published in the English literature were assessed, and given that constipation is a common global problem, it is possible that there are some remedies that have been tested and published in other languages that have been excluded in this review. We did exclude studies of less than 4 weeks' duration because we believed that a product that is likely to benefit a chronic condition should demonstrate both efficacy and safety over at least a one-month period. Although there are several methods of categorizing the basis of evidence for drug efficacy and safety, we chose the USPSTF criteria to provide meaningful comparative data with our previous analysis.

In conclusion, PEG and senna are the only OTC laxatives with level I evidence and grade A recommendations for the treatment of constipation, although PEG is the only one supported by both short- and long-term studies. Other OTC laxatives with a grade B recommendation include psyllium, SupraFiber, magnesium-rich water, magnesium oxide, diphenylmethane stimulants (bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate), fruit-based laxatives (kiwi, mango, prunes, and ficus), and yogurt plus galacto-oligosaccharide, prunes, and linseed oil. There was insufficient evidence (grade I) for polydextrose, inulin, and fructo-oligosaccharide. For these and other alternative products, there is a clear need for more rigorous, high-quality studies using standardized endpoints. Docusate lacks well-controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy and has poor evidence to support its use in clinical practice.

### Efficacy of 1 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid with linaclotide versus senna for bowel preparation: a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial (apple trial) [^117URUbw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

BP method

All patients received verbal and written instructions from the medical staff regarding BP and were instructed to consume a low-fiber diet and stop taking laxatives other than BP solution the day before the examination. Patients in the 1 L-PEG/AS group received 24 mg senna and those in the 1 L-PEG/AL group received 0.5 mg linaclotide at 8:00the day before colonoscopy, at the prescribed dosage for chronic constipation in Japan. Both groups drank 1 L PEG-Asc solution (Movie Prep; EA Pharma Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) 4–6 hours before the procedure from 9:00 to 11:00, at a rate of 500 mL every 30 minutes, and drank 250 mL of water for every 500 mL of PEG-Asc. Patients were instructed to complete the procedure at least 2 hours before colonoscopy and subsequently drink clear liquids to ensure adequate hydration. Patients who did not defecate before the scheduled colonoscopy were recorded as having insufficient BP, treated with additional PEG-Asc or an enema to allow the colonoscopy to be performed.

Data collection

Demographic and comorbidity data were obtained using questionnaires. Chronic constipation was diagnosed based on evidence-based clinical guidelines for chronic constipation 2023. The severity of constipation was measured using the Constipation Scoring System (range 0–30). Colonoscopy and BP data were obtained through another questionnaire on the day of colonoscopy.

Colonoscopies were performed under sedation by 15 experienced gastroenterologists (experience of > 1,000 procedures) using 290 series of high-resolution colonoscopes equipped with a water jet pump (Olympus Optical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). A complete colonoscopy was defined as arrival at the cecum. Incomplete colonoscopy was attributed to technical difficulty or strictures. Patients who canceled the treatment were asked to inquire about the reasons.

Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture, which is a secure web-based platform that facilitates data capture for research by offering an intuitive interface, audit trails, automated export procedures, and data integration capabilities with external sources.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^113odVHC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Psyllium and SupraFiber both have level II evidence and grade B recommendations. Despite the addition of 9 new studies, psyllium seems to have only modest efficacy and in head-to-head trials seems inferior to some other agents (e.g. PEG, lactulose, and prunes). Thus, its level of evidence and grade recommendation remains unchanged. Other fiber laxatives (polydextrose, inulin, and insoluble fibers) have insufficient evidence to recommend for or against their use in the treatment of constipation.

Magnesium-containing agents seem to be effective. Four high-quality placebo-controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of both magnesium-containing mineral water and, more recently, magnesium oxide, resulting in level I evidence and a grade B recommendation. However, there was a lack of standardization of magnesium content in the evaluated preparations. The starting dose of magnesium oxide was 1.5 g daily, but 53.3% of subjects required a dose reduction during the 4-week trial. Allowance for dose reduction resulted in a lack of any withdrawals. No further studies evaluating magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) were identified. More recent studies using stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, and senna) have yielded improved levels of evidence and grade recommendations. Although all 3 had level III evidence with grade C recommendations in the previous systematic review, the current review identified level I evidence with grade B recommendations for both bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate and level I evidence and a grade A recommendation for senna. However, diphenylmethane derivatives are associated with a significantly greater incidence of GI adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain) which may limit their clinical utility. Senna was tested in 2 randomized placebo-controlled studies with both yielding improvements in constipation. The most recent study with senna used a starting dose of 1 g/d, and although it was significantly more efficacious than placebo and comparable with magnesium oxide, dose reductions were required in 83.3% of subjects. Thus, whether a smaller dose of this product is as effective and better tolerated, especially for the occasional constipation, merits further study. Of the fruit-based laxatives evaluated, kiwi was the only one with Level I evidence (i.e. 2 randomized controlled trials), whereas mango, prunes, and ficus all had level II evidence (1 trial each). These products were efficacious (grade B recommendation), but because of the few studies with limited numbers of patients, they were afforded lower Grade recommendations.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^113JReQ8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — osmotic and stimulant laxatives: Osmotic laxatives are an appropriate firstline medical therapy to manage chronic constipation. Stimulant laxatives, such as bisacodyl, can be considered for rescue therapy or as a second-line therapy, if needed. Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence. Osmotic agents used in the treatment of constipation include polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based solutions and magnesium salt–based products, and osmotic laxatives are generally preferred over stimulants, such as senna or bisacodyl, given the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety with PEG-based treatment. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing superiority of PEG versus lactulose for improving stool frequency and consistency, relieving abdominal pain, and reducing use of other laxatives; magnesium salt laxatives such as magnesium sulfate have been shown to improve stool frequency and consistency compared with placebo with safety profiles comparable to PEG solutions. For stimulants, a meta-analysis demonstrated superior efficacy for sodium picosulfate and bisacodyl at 4 weeks compared to prescription motility agents and secretagogues, with abdominal pain as the most frequent side effect, and there is a lack of RCTs documenting the safety and efficacy of anthraquinone stimulant laxatives, including senna, cascara, and aloe, in treating chronic constipation.

### The impact of laxative use upon symptoms in patients with proven slow transit constipation [^112qbty2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Laxative Use

The patients in this study used a wide variety and combination of laxatives. We defined a laxative as an agent specifically designed to stimulate the evacuation of faeces. The vast majority of laxatives used fell into two specific groups; i) Stimulant laxatives (Senna, Bisacodyl, Coloxyl, Durolax, Aloe); ii) Osmotics Laxatives (PEG, Milk of Magnesia, Magnesium sulfate). Twenty of the patients also used enemas. In 18 patients enemas were used on ≤ 5 occasions during the 3-week period and always in combination with other laxatives. In 2 patients enemas were used without any other laxatives. These two patients used the enemas on every 2nd or 3rd day respectively. The laxatives were also occasionally supplemented with bulking agents such as prunes or bran. The wide variety of laxative doses and combinations prevented any meaningful statistical comparison between specific laxative type/dose and symptoms.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^113rvz7n]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid-induced constipation in people with cancer — advises to rule out other causes and emergent conditions, set the "Goal: Soft, formed bowel movements every 1–2 days without straining or pain", and "Always begin a prophylactic bowel regimen when starting opioid therapy". It directs "Prevention: Senna with or without docusate daily, titrated as needed to meet goal", and "Treatment: Once constipation occurs, magnesium-based products and laxatives such as bisacodyl". If nausea accompanies constipation, clinicians should "consider suppositories or enemas (contraindicated in thrombocytopenia or neutropenia)".

### Effectiveness of laxatives in elderly – a cross sectional study in nursing homes [^111NvwK1]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Use of laxatives

The use and dosage of laxatives was recorded at ATC-level 5. Groups of laxatives were defined at ATC-level 4: osmotically acting laxatives (A06AD); contact laxatives (A06AB); bulk laxatives (A06AC); enemas (A06AG); and softeners/emollients (A06AA). The dosage of each laxative was graded as on demand, regular use standard dose, and regular use of high dose. High dose was defined as: liquid paraffin > 15ml/day; bisacodyl > 10mg/day; senna glycosides > 24mg/day; sodium pico sulphate: > 10 drops (5 mg)/day; lactulose > 30ml/day; macrogol combinations: > 26.2 (2 sachets); docusate sodium > 1 supp/day; and laurilsulfate: > 1supp/day. An overall grading of the laxative effect of the regimens from low to high was as follows: on demand treatment only; regular use of only fibre or lactulose; regular use of only contact laxatives, enemas, polyethylene glycol or liquid paraffin; and use of at least two laxatives of which one was used regularly. Proper use of laxatives was assessed by comparison with generally accepted treatment recommendations.

Bowel function

Defecation frequency (number of stools per day), stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale score 1–7), straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockade, and manual manoeuvres to facilitate bowel movements, were recorded. Normal bowel function was defined as defecation frequency from three defecations/week to three defecations/day and stool consistency 3–5 on Bristol Stool Form Scale.

### Efficacy of 1 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid with linaclotide versus senna for bowel preparation: a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial (apple trial) [^113Rs2KD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Linaclotide with 1 L PEG-Asc significantly improved BP quality compared with the senna regimen without reducing tolerability. Furthermore, the linaclotide regimen demonstrated efficacy even in the high-risk group with inadequate BP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of linaclotide as an adjunct laxative to 1 L PEG-Asc.

The demand for low-volume regimens with high tolerability is increasing. Although several low-volume agents (≤ 1-L) such as sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, PEG with a high concentration of ascorbate, sodium phosphate solution, or oral sulfate solution were developed, these regimens except for oral sulfate solution failed to meet the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy's quality standard of 90%. In addition, these hyperosmotic and stimulant agents have been reported to increase risks such as colonic ischemia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy does not recommend the routine use of these agents owing to their safety profile. Moreover, most of these low-volume regimens do not eliminate the need for patients to ingest large amounts of fluids along with laxatives to maintain hydration, amounting to 3–4 L of fluids. Therefore, various adjuvants combined with PEG-based solutions have been explored to enhance BP quality and minimize its volume and risks. In this study, the 1L-PEG/AL demonstrated higher efficacy with a safety profile similar to that of 1L-PEG/AS, which we previously reported to have noninferior efficacy and greater tolerability compared with the standard 2 L PEG-Asc regimen. Although a direct comparison between the linaclotide and standard regimen has not been made, the former may demonstrate noninferiority or even superiority to the standard regimen. In addition, the mean total volume in the 1 L-PEG/AL regimen was < 2 L, representing a significant step toward a real reduction of total liquids, potentially enhancing patient acceptability.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^116sdzyj]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna recommendation: In adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations state that trials were conducted for 4 weeks and longer term use is probably appropriate but needs data on tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used and the panel suggests starting at a lower dose and increase if there is no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Bisacodyl: a review of pharmacology and clinical evidence to guide use in clinical practice in patients with constipation [^112akg4j]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

5 THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY AND SAFETY DATA FROM CLINICAL TRIALS

Clinical investigations and studies on bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate have been performed since the 1950 s according to standards applicable at the time they were conducted. Since the introduction of good clinical practice, major clinical trials have been performed by Kienzle‐Horn et al (2006)and Kamm et al (2011)for bisacodyl, and Mueller‐Lissner et al (2010)for sodium picosulfate. Kienzle‐Horn (2007)also conducted a comparative study of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate. An overview of the clinical trials of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate is provided in Table 2. Large, randomized controlled trials for other stimulant laxatives like senna are missing from the literature. In 2006, Kienzle‐Horn et al reported the results of a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled study that investigated the effect of bisacodyl 10 mg daily for 3 days on the frequency and consistency of stools in 55 patients with CC. Bisacodyl was associated with a significantly greater mean number of stools per day compared with placebo, as well as an improvement in mean stool consistency score. Treatment was well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events (AEs) between bisacodyl and placebo.

### Review article: do stimulant laxatives damage the gut? A critical analysis of current knowledge [^115rfGqL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Literature searches for articles in English were performed in PubMed and Embase up to and including June 2023 without chronological restriction and using the search terms 'stimulant laxatives (cathartics)', 'bisacodyl', 'SPS', and 'senna' in combination with 'chronic disease' [Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms], 'constipation/drug therapy' (MeSH terms), and 'chronic constipation'. These terms were searched in various combinations, that is, with constipation including drug therapy (including dosage and administration), metabolism, morphological changes, chronic disease, intestinal mucosa ultrastructure, gastrointestinal motility (including drug effects and colon diagnostic imaging/case-control studies), and in combination with the terms 'colorectal' and 'renal neoplasms' and related topics and terms 'adverse effects of stimulant laxatives', 'myenteric plexus/drug effects'. The topic 'bowel preparation or bowel cleansing' was expressly excluded.

The searches yielded 68 results in PubMed and 126 in Embase. Publications were considered relevant for inclusion if they covered a case report or a study containing treatment safety-related information. Studies were selected if they reported on preclinical or clinical aspects of epithelial, morphological, or anatomical alterations of the intestinal wall and enteric nervous system (ENS), potentially attributable to long-term or chronic intermittent treatment with stimulant laxatives, including senna and sennosides, diphenylmethanes including bisacodyl, SPS, and also phenolphthalein. Reports mentioning these alterations were considered as they might subsequently result in functional impairment, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Duplicates were removed, and those publications that did not report any clinically relevant morphological changes of enteric neural elements or intestinal smooth muscle in response to long-term or chronic intermittent treatment with stimulant laxatives were excluded.

In addition, a series of studies associated with the development of bisacodyl were included in our analysis, even if they had not all been published. These assessed the non-clinical toxicologyand the genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic potential of bisacodyl (Data on File), and some included a comparison with phenolphthalein.

### Improving management of constipation in an inpatient setting using a care bundle [^116MC11F]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

A brief literature review revealed that there is no definite consensus for the treatment of constipation and laxative prescription. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced a clinical knowledge statement on adult constipation (2013). There were some NHS trust guidelines and one policy. In general, the non-pharmacological components for preventing/treating constipation were highlighted, ie optimising patient hydration and mobility, reviewing drug charts to reduce or discontinue constipating drugs if possible, a high fibre diet, and having appropriate toileting facilities readily available.

In terms of prescribed laxatives, bulking agents (eg, Fybogel) should really be prescribed first line in ambulant elderly patients. The main side effect is crampy abdominal pain and patients with irritable bowel syndrome may not tolerate them well. A a stimulant laxative (eg, Senna), or an osmotic laxative (eg, Movicol) can be used as second or third line. Stimulant laxatives should not be used long term and osmotic laxatives need a good oral fluid intake to work. Using two laxatives of the same type is generally not recommended.

We acknowledge that constipation treatment may need tailored to individuals, with patients preferring certain treatments. The approach to chronic constipation will need to be different, with a plan for the medium and long term. This is particularly important at the discharge point from the hospital. However, we are only looking at acute constipation in this project. A rectal examination (PR) is recommended after three days to assess for fecal loading and the potential need for an enema laxative.

AGA-ACG CIC guideline evidence review — PICO scope and eligibility: The systematic review is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews website (CRD42021254673). The population of interest was adults (18 years or older) diagnosed with CIC, and studies were excluded where individuals had opioid-induced constipation or constipation due to other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism and celiac disease, as well as studies in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Interventions included fiber (psyllium, bran, methylcellulose, and inulin), osmotic or surfactant laxatives (PEG, magnesium oxide [MgO], lactulose, and docusate), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, senna, and sodium picosulfate), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, and plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) agonist prucalopride, with studies included when the intervention duration was at least 4 weeks. The comparison group included placebo, no intervention, or standard of care.

### Constipation: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^113TiNnJ]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic constipation accounts for at least 8 million annual visits to health care providers in the United States and is associated with large expenditures for diagnostic testing and prescription and nonprescription laxatives.

Observations

Strong evidence for efficacy has been established for stimulant and osmotic laxatives, new intestinal secretogogues, and peripherally restricted μ-opiate receptor antagonists, the latter a major advance in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). An algorithm provided to evaluate chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) that is refractory to available laxatives focuses on the importance of defecation disorders and biofeedback therapies. When used appropriately, available stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl are both safe and effective when used long-term. There is a paucity of (and a strong desire for) studies that compare inexpensive laxatives with newer agents that work by other mechanisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The choice of treatment for CIC and OIC should be based on cost as well as efficacy. The small subgroup of patients who do not respond to currently available laxatives requires further evaluation at experienced centers that are capable of performing studies of defecation and colonic transit.

### Constipation in people prescribed opioids [^113y6bo4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is reported in 52% of people with advanced malignancy. This figure rises to 87% in people who are terminally ill and taking opioids. Constipation may be the most common adverse effect of opioids. There is no reason to believe that people with chronic non-malignant disease who take opioids will be any less troubled by this adverse effect.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral laxatives, rectally applied medications, and opioid antagonists for constipation in people prescribed opioids? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil enemas, bisacodyl, co-danthrusate/co-danthramer, docusate, glycerol suppositories, ispaghula husk, lactulose, liquid paraffin, macrogols plus electrolyte solutions, magnesium salts, methylcellulose, opioid antagonists, phosphate enemas, senna, sodium citrate micro-enema, and sodium picosulfate.

### Efficacy of maZiRenWan, a Chinese herbal medicine, in patients with functional constipation in a randomized controlled trial [^112YTVTM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The Chinese herbal medicine, MaZiRenWan (MZRW), has been used for more than 2000 years to treat constipation, but it has not been tested in a randomized controlled trial. We performed a trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MZRW, compared with the stimulant laxative senna or placebo, for patients with functional constipation (FC).

Methods

We performed a double-blind, double-dummy, trial of 291 patients with FC based on Rome III criteria, seen at 8 clinics in Hong Kong from June 2013 through August 2015. Patients were observed for 2 weeks and then assigned randomly (1:1:1) to groups given MZRW (7.5 g, twice daily), senna (15 mg daily), or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients were then followed for 8 weeks and evaluated at baseline and weeks 4, 8 (end of treatment), and 16 (end of follow up). Participants recorded information on stool form and frequency, feeling of complete evacuation, and research medication taken. Data on individual bowel symptoms, global symptom improvement, and adverse events were collected. A complete response was defined as an increase ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM)/week from baseline (the primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included response during the follow-up period, colonic transit, individual and global symptom assessments, quality of life measured with 36-item short form Chinese version, and adverse events.

Results

Although there was no statistically significant difference in proportions of patients with a complete response to MZRW (68%) vs. senna (57.7%) (P = 0.14) at week 8, there was a statistically significant difference vs. placebo (33.0%) (P < .005). At the 16-week timepoint (after the 8-week follow-up period), 47.4% of patients had a complete response to MZRW, 20.6% had a complete response to senna, and 17.5% had a complete response to placebo (P < .005 for MZRW vs. placebo). The group that received MZRW group also had significant increases in colonic transit and reduced severity of constipation, straining, incomplete evacuation, and global constipation symptoms compared with the groups that received placebo or senna in (P < .05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

In a randomized controlled trial of 291 patients with FC, we found MZRW to be well-tolerated and effective in increasing CSBM/week. MZRW did not appear to be more effective than senna and might be considered as an alternative to this drug. ClincialTrials.gov no: NCT01695850.

### Optimizing adequacy of bowel cleansing for colonoscopy: recommendations from the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^114MBA5d]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Other OTC products — senna was studied in 4 randomized controlled trials, either alone (3 trials) or combined with 2L PEG-ELS (1 trial), compared with high- or low-volume PEG-ELS. High-dose senna (24 tablets of 12 mg each) was as effective as 4L PEG-ELS in 2 studies, but patients receiving senna experienced significantly more cramps and abdominal pain. Low-dose senna (3–12 tablets) has been combined with 2L PEG-ELS to increase its cleansing effect. In 2 randomized trials comparing bisacodyl (30–40 mg) with NaP solution, bisacodyl achieved significantly lower rates of satisfactory bowel cleansing; tolerability was comparable except for nausea, which was more common with NaP.

### Treatment of opioid-induced constipation: inducing laxation and understanding the risk of gastrointestinal perforation [^1168V2mo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

A PubMed search of all available English-language articles through July 16, 2024, was conducted using the following search terms: ("guideline" or "recommendation"); "intestinal perforation", "methylnaltrexone", "naloxegol", "naldemedine", "opioid-induced constipation", "pathophysiology", "prevalence", "PAMORA", "perforation", "peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist", "obstruction", and "risk factors". The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, which contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to the FDA, was searched, with reports available through June 30, 2024. Data were gathered on all reports of perforation (predefined reaction terms: diverticular perforation, gastric perforation, gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal perforation, large intestine perforation, ileal perforation, esophageal perforation, small intestinal perforation) associated with methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, naldemedine, lubiprostone, prucalopride, linaclotide, plecanatide, bisacodyl, and senna. Both generic and brand names were searched, and outcomes of life-threatening events or mortality were tabulated.

### Laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care [^114LyDcP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This article describes the second update of a Cochrane review on the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. Previous versions were published in 2006 and 2010 where we also evaluated trials of methylnaltrexone; these trials have been removed as they are included in another review in press. In these earlier versions, we drew no conclusions on individual effectiveness of different laxatives because of the limited number of evaluations. This is despite constipation being common in palliative care, generating considerable suffering due to the unpleasant physical symptoms and the availability of a wide range of laxatives with known differences in effect in other populations.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and differential efficacy of laxatives used to manage constipation in people receiving palliative care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science (SCI & CPCI-S) for trials to September 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating laxatives for constipation in people receiving palliative care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the studies depended upon clinical and outcome measure homogeneity.

Main Results

We identified five studies involving the laxatives lactulose, senna, co-danthramer, misrakasneham, docusate and magnesium hydroxide with liquid paraffin. Overall, the study findings were at an unclear risk of bias. As all five studies compared different laxatives or combinations of laxatives, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. There was no evidence on whether individual laxatives were more effective than others or caused fewer adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This second update found that laxatives were of similar effectiveness but the evidence remains limited due to insufficient data from a few small RCTs. None of the studies evaluated polyethylene glycol or any intervention given rectally. There is a need for more trials to evaluate the effectiveness of laxatives in palliative care populations. Extrapolating findings on the effectiveness of laxatives evaluated in other populations should proceed with caution. This is because of the differences inherent in people receiving palliative care that may impact, in a likely negative way, on the effect of a laxative.

### Review article: do stimulant laxatives damage the gut? A critical analysis of current knowledge [^113FJM2B]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In a review of more than 70 publications describing 240 cases of stimulant laxative abuse, no cases of cathartic colon were reported, nor could any published case of cathartic colon be identified in which laxative intake started after 1960. Certainly, no randomized, prospective, controlled studies have demonstrated morphological changes of enteric neural elements or intestinal smooth muscle by senna, bisacodyl, or SPS. Nor did the chronic use of senna cause any structural and/or functional alteration of the enteric nerves or the smooth intestinal muscle. Thus, the available evidence indicates that chronic use of stimulant laxatives is unlikely to damage the colon.

An important consideration when interpreting the findings of studies that report potential safety concerns with stimulant laxatives is that many of these, did not control for potentially important confounding factors such as age and concomitant diseases. Age is obviously an important factor when considering a possible relationship between laxative use and cancer incidence since both increase with age. Similarly, comorbidities (notably diabetes) that are known to cause constipation affect the ENS and are associated with the development of damage to the myenteric plexus. – Diabetes is associated with the development of autonomic neuropathy affecting the intrinsic neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle, and can result in neuron loss/dysfunction and subsequent gastrointestinal complications (constipation has been reported in up to 60% of diabetics with autonomic polyneuropathy).

### Sennosides [^112P9rJi]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of sennosides PO (also known as Senna Laxative) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The intermittent use of sennosides should be limited to use under the advice of a qualified health care professional and after safer agents have failed to produce intended results. The safest first-line treatments to use for constipation during pregnancy are those that are not absorbed systemically (e.g., fiber, bulk-forming laxatives, stool softeners such as docusate) in order to minimize drug exposure to the fetus. Polyethylene glycol 3350 has minimal systemic absorption and is also considered a first-line option for chronic constipation during pregnancy.

### Unmet needs in pediatric functional constipation [^111f9RCh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In a recent RCT conducted in constipated children with anorectal malformations, senna demonstrated greater efficacy than PEG on the endpoints assessed, including presence of daily bowel movements, absence of fecal soiling, and a clean abdominal X-ray obtained after passing stool. However, in previous studies senna was less effective than lactulose or mineral oil, and was associated with worsened fecal incontinence. Taken together, existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence favoring any particular treatment option for PFC.

Currently, few data exist about the safety profiles and reported adverse events of laxatives; compounding this issue, the potential side effects of laxatives are gastrointestinal-related, similar to complaints mentioned by constipated children. The common adverse events of laxatives include diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and abdominal cramping, many of which are similar to symptoms of PFC. Therefore, well-designed large placebo-controlled trials are needed to establish the tolerability profile of these treatments in the pediatric population.

Because constipation is a chronic problem, treatment outcomes ideally need to be assessed over the long term. However, it is difficult to assess the long-term efficacy of PEG and other laxatives when the great majority of published studies had short durations and lacked follow-up periods. Our research showed that among 25 RCTs conducted for laxatives, only 1 study assessed long-term efficacy (> 3 months), and nearly half of the remaining studies measured outcomes at ≤ 1 month. These findings highlight the need for well-designed clinical studies of sufficient duration that permit investigation of current treatments on constipation outcomes over an extended period (6–12 months).

Besides oral laxatives, a limited number of pharmacological therapies have been studied in PFC. Our literature review revealed that prucalopride was the only drug therapy tested in phase 3 clinical trials for PFC. Although these studies demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for prucalopride in the pediatric population, they failed to meet their primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of responders, defined as the proportion of children with toileting skills who had a mean of > 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week and 1 episode of fecal incontinence per 2 weeks), and response rates with prucalopride versus placebo were 17.0% and 17.8% (P = 0.90), respectively.

### Bowel preparation for pediatric colonoscopy: report of the NASPGHAN endoscopy and procedures committee [^1118ucpS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Survey of present national practice — 2- to 5-year-old patients (~10–20 kg) showed the following regimens. Monotherapy (N = 26) most commonly used polyethylene glycol (PEG)-3350 with an age-based dose of 4 capfuls in 32 oz of fluids, taken by drinking throughout the day one day before colonoscopy, and a weight-based regimen of 1.5 g · kg−1 · day−1 in 8 oz of fluids. Dual therapy (N = 16) most commonly combined PEG-3350 and senna, with sennosides dosed 4.3–4.4 or 8.6–8.8 mg given once one day before colonoscopy. Additional therapy (N = 41) included a subgroup with no additional therapy (N = 3). Dietary changes (N = 40) most commonly were "Clear liquids only" 1 day before colonoscopy. Rectal therapy (N = 11) most commonly used pediatric bisacodyl at 5 mg/suppository, two suppositories/day, one day before colonoscopy, and rectal therapy day of procedure occurred before and on same day of procedure.

### Unmet needs in pediatric functional constipation [^1162SZoX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Current Treatment Options

Oral laxatives are the most commonly prescribed treatments for fecal disimpaction and maintenance therapy, but their long-term use has not been adequately evaluated. - The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes, dosed orally (1–1.5 g/kg/d) for 3 to 6 days as the first-line treatment for children presenting with fecal impaction. If PEG is unavailable, lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, whereas milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as additional or second-line treatment. While significant improvements in constipation symptoms have been reported with both osmotic (eg, PEG) and stimulant (eg, senna) laxatives in RCTs, approximately 40% to 50% of children with functional constipation experience at least 1 episode of relapse within the first 5 years after initial recovery. Dietary fibers, traditional medicine, and probiotics are commonly used; however, the clinical evidence supporting their use is not clear.- Prebiotics and probiotics may be effective at improving clinical symptoms, but data from RCTs are limited.

Among the nonpharmacological interventions, sacral neuromodulation provides a suitable option for refractory PFC, but it is not frequently used, and data on its clinical benefits in children are limited. In a prospective cohort study (n = 30), sacral neuromodulation improved the mean defecation frequency, which was sustained over a prolonged period; however, the quality of life of the patients continued to be lower than that of the normal population. Enemas are effective for severe PFC, but their long-term use in children is often impractical and may be perceived as uncomfortable. Several surgical approaches, including antegrade enemas, are associated with improved clinical outcomes in severe and intractable constipation. Surgical implantation of conduits for antegrade enema may cause complications such as stoma-related and other perioperative complications; however, long-term use of antegrade enemas does yield successful results in nearly 70% of cases.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^114iRsaC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

OIBD prevention or symptomatic treatment?

The onset rate of OIBD ranges between 2 and 40%, suggesting the high probability for patients under opioid therapy to develop constipation.

OIBD therapy includes several lines of treatment, defined in the most recent recommendations and guidelines.

The main characteristic of OIBD is a delayed colonic transit. Opiates interfere with the release of acetylcholine at the level of inhibitory neurons of the myenteric plexus, resulting in an increase in the circular muscle cells tone. The measurement of opioid potency relative to morphine is based on this model of inhibition.

This consideration suggests that the prescription of opioid therapy should be associated from the outset with prevention of constipation and close monitoring of therapeutic efficacy every 3 days, at least in the initial phase of treatment. However, pre-existing conditions must be always considered.

A key issue is preventing faecaloma. An increased intake of fibre may not be able to stimulate motor activity and paradoxically would favour the formation of faecalomas. Osmotic laxatives are often considered as the first choice to soften faeces, but they are associated with several side effects including flatulence and nausea. Saline laxatives may trigger electrolytic disorders, and disaccharides can cause abdominal distension and flatulence.

Among osmotic laxatives, macrogol can be definitely recommended as a preventive therapy, as it is not associated with relevant side effects, except inappetence and nausea when administered at high dosages.

An algorithm proposed in 2005 suggested:
macrogol;
macrogol plus a stimulant laxative (senna or bisacodyl);
association of three or more laxatives in case of non-responsiveness.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115ueToi]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance. Review considerations related to access to care because of the clinical oversight needed to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments for pain.
Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long-term use and that complete elimination of pain is unlikely.
Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when pain is not eliminated.
Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major obligations at work, school, or home.
Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g. a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) is usually needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are taken regularly. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided.
If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks for taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.
Discuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated, when dosages are increased, or when other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently.
Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.
Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e. not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).
Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed drugs such as heroin, or other opioids.
Discuss risks for household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused opioids.
Discuss the importance of periodic reassessment to ensure that opioids are helping to meet patient goals and, if opioids are not effective or are harmful, to allow opportunities for consideration of opioid tapering and dosage reduction or discontinuation and of additional nonpharmacologic or nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options.
Discuss expectations for clinician and patient responsibilities to mitigate risks of opioid therapy and planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10).
Consider whether cognitive status might interfere with management of opioid therapy and, if so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly comanage medication therapy. Discuss the importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver, as appropriate.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^1158712i]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current clinical guidelines for chronic constipation offer limited dietary recommendations. The aim of this project was to develop the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation in adults.

Methods

Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The findings generated from the meta-analyses were then used to develop guideline statements using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and a Delphi consensus survey among a multidisciplinary expert Guideline Steering Committee. Recommendation statements were produced for treatment response, stool output, gut symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life, and only based on the findings where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta-analysis. The strength of recommendation was assessed using the GRADE approach. Consensus voting among the Guideline Steering Committee was performed using a modified Delphi survey approach.

Results

The four systematic reviews included a total of 75 RCTs. Fifty-nine dietary recommendation statements were generated and accepted through the Delphi survey. For dietary supplements, 15 recommendation statements relate to fiber supplements, 20 relate to probiotics, two to synbiotics, five to magnesium oxide, two to senna, and three to kiwifruit supplements. For foods, three recommendation statements related to kiwifruits, two to prunes, and two to rye bread. For drinks, five recommendation statements related to high mineral-containing water. No recommendations were made for whole diet approaches due to lack of evidence. Twelve statements had a very low level of evidence, 39 had a low level of evidence, and eight had moderate evidence. Twenty-seven statements were strong recommendations, and 32 were qualified recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of constipation based upon a robust systematic review and GRADE processes. Recommendations were made for dietary supplements, foods, and drinks that have never been previously included in clinical guidelines, and can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes.

Technical advances have made it possible to obtain thinner slices without a gap and maintaining a short acquisition time, thus often eliminating the need for a third plane (which is useful in the case of partial volume) suggesting the usefulness of 3DT2 sequences with multi-planar reconstructions, even if the consensus has not yet reached 80% (Table 1).

### Treatment of childhood constipation by primary care physicians: efficacy and predictors of outcome [^112Gm1aD]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Childhood constipation accounts for 3% of visits to general pediatric clinics and as many as 30% of visits to pediatric gastroenterologists. The majority of children who experience constipation and whose caregivers seek medical care are seen by primary care physicians such as pediatricians or family physicians. Little is known about how primary care physicians treat childhood constipation or the success of their treatments. With this study, we prospectively examined which treatments primary care physicians prescribe to children who present for the first time with constipation and how effective those treatments are.

Methods

A total of 119 children who were between 2 and 7 years of age (mean: 44.1 ± 13.6 months) and presented to 26 different primary care physicians (15 pediatricians and 11 family physicians) for the treatment of constipation for the first time participated in this study. Parents completed daily diaries of their child's bowel habits for 2 weeks before starting treatment recommended by their primary care physician and again 2 months after treatment. The prescribed treatment was identified by reviewing office records of the treating physicians.

Results

After 2 months of treatment, 44 (37%) of 119 children remained constipated. In the majority (87%) of cases, physicians prescribed some form of laxative or stool softener. The most commonly prescribed laxatives were magnesium hydroxide (77%), senna syrup (23%), mineral oil (8%), and lactulose (8%). In nearly all cases, a specific fixed dose of laxative was recommended; in only 5% of cases were parents instructed clearly to adjust the dose of laxative up or down to get the desired effect. In approximately half of the cases, physicians recommended some sort of dietary intervention. Some form of behavioral intervention was mentioned in the office records of approximately one third of cases; however, in most cases, little detail was provided. In 45% of cases, physicians prescribed disimpaction using oral cathartics, enemas, or suppositories followed by daily laxatives. In 35% of cases, physicians prescribed daily laxatives without any disimpaction procedure. In the remainder, physicians prescribed only dietary changes (5%), the use of intermittent laxatives (9%), or no therapy (7%). Treatment success corresponded to how aggressively the child was treated. Specifically, children who underwent some form of colonic evacuation followed by daily laxative therapy were more likely to have responded to treatment than were those who were treated less aggressively.

Conclusion

Primary care physicians tend to undertreat childhood constipation. After 2 months of treatment, nearly 40% of constipated children remain symptomatic.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1154EVmS]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before prescribing outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following:

Advise patients that short-term opioid use can lead to unintended long-term opioid use and of the importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
Review communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to tell clinicians of severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management.
Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and development of a potentially serious opioid use disorder (see Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. Prophylactic pharmacologic therapy (e.g. a stimulant laxative such as senna, with or without a stool softener) might be needed to ensure regular bowel movements if opioids are used for more than a few days. Stool softeners or fiber laxatives without another laxative should be avoided. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should provide and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain (e.g. taking the opioid only when needed if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of tolerance and therefore withdrawal after opioids are discontinued.
If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the risks of taking additional over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen.
To help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that the goal is to reduce pain to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain.
Discuss effects that opioids might have on a person's ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines or alcohol) are used concurrently.
Discuss the potential for workplace toxicology testing programs to detect therapeutic opioid use.
Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed (i.e. not taking more opioids than prescribed or taking them more often).
Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sedatives, alcohol, nonprescribed or illicit drugs (e.g. heroin), or other opioids (see Recommendations 8 and 11).
Discuss risks to household members and other persons if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility that others might experience overdose at the same or lower dosage than prescribed for the patient and that young children and pets are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of opioids in a secure and preferably locked location, options for safe disposal of unused opioids, and the value of having naloxone available.
Discuss planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see Recommendation 8) and clinician use of PDMP information (see Recommendation 9).

### Polyethylene glycol powder solution versus senna for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children [^113PzQeB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Safety and effectiveness of large-volume polyethylene glycol-based solution (PEG-ES) have been documented, but the taste and volume can be barriers to successful colonoscopy preparation. Efficacy and safety of small-volume electrolyte-free (PEG-P) preparation (Miralax) for colonoscopy preparation have been rarely studied, although presently used at many pediatric centers. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether PEG-P results in a more efficacious and safe colonoscopy preparation as compared with senna.

Methods

The study design was prospective, randomized, and single-blinded. Patients ages 6 to 21 years were randomized to a 2-day clean-out regimen of PEG-P at a dose of 1.5 g/kg divided twice per day for 2 days versus senna 15 mL daily (ages 6–12) or 30 mL daily (ages 12–21) for 2 days. Both preparations required 1 day of clear liquids whereas senna preparation required an additional day of full liquid diet. A blinded endoscopist graded the quality of preparation with a standardized cleanliness tool (Aronchick scale). Serum chemistry panels were obtained. Patients or parents rated symptoms and ease of preparation. The anticipated number of subjects was 166; however, the interim analysis demonstrated inferiority of senna preparation.

Results

Thirty patients were evaluated in the present study. Of the patients in the PEG-P arm, 88% (14/16) received an excellent/good score compared with 29% (4/14), with the senna preparation (P = 0.0022). Both preparations were well-tolerated by patient-graded ease of preparation. Demographics and laboratory values did not differ significantly across the 2 groups. No serious adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

PEG-P is an effective colonoscopy preparation whereas senna preparation was insufficient. Both were well-tolerated and appear safe in a pediatric population.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^116S9CSD]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The Choice of a Laxative to Treat OIC/OIBD Depends on the Perceived Efficacy and the Preference of the Patient; Indirect Evidence Favors Bisacodyl, Sodium Picosulfate, Macrogol (Polyethelene Glycol), and Sennosides as First Choice

Comment: Both bisacodyl (and its derivative sodium picosulfate) and sennosides stimulate secretion and are very potent prokinetics in the colon. Their prokinetic action may potentially also be active in the more oral segments of the gut. Bisacodyl is used as the rescue laxative in most of the therapeutic trials for OIC, and the amount taken is considered a sensitive variable for the efficacy of the drug under investigation. Macrogol and sugars, such as lactulose, act by binding water. Macrogol and lactulose proved to be significantly superior to placebo, macrogol being numerically better than lactulose (Table 1).

Table 1
Controlled trials with laxatives in OIC

When the choice of the rescue laxative was decided by OIC patients, in one study approximately 80–90% of patients preferred a "stimulant laxative" (bisacodyl or senna), whereas in another study macrogol and sodium picosulfate were the preferred laxatives. Hence, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, sennosides, and macrogol appear to have similar efficacy in OIC.

Preventive administration of laxatives to 720 adult Japanese patients treated with oral opioid analgesics for the first time was effective in preventing OIC (defined as a stool-free interval of ≥ 72 hours). The most frequently prescribed laxatives were magnesium oxide and senna. There were no apparent differences in the efficacy between laxatives.

Of importance is that many patients are not informed (or do not recall that they have been informed) about constipation and laxatives when opioids are prescribed. Hence, in a recent interview study at the pharmacy with patients having their first opioid prescription, only 28% remembered having received information about the risk of constipation and 13% were prescribed laxatives or instructed to request them.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^113kBWc5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Previously published reviews on the management of childhood constipation have commented on the lack of high quality clinical trials in the field, – despite the widespread use of laxatives. Although there remain significant gaps in the evidence base, this literature review has demonstrated that the evidence base of current clinical practice is now improving.

The placebo-controlled study of PEG+E by Thomson et al defines a baseline proof of principle in a relatively mildly affected population, while the two phase study by Candy et al confirms that, once disimpacted, even severely affected children can be maintained satisfactorily on low doses of PEG+E (the mean daily dose was just under two paediatric dose sachets). PEG+E could also be used as monotherapy whereas almost one third of patients on lactulose required senna. No patient on PEG+E reimpacted compared with almost one in four on lactulose.

The five studies comparing PEG with lactulose – exhibit some potentially important differences that prevent the results being pooled in meta-analysis. Firstly, they involve three different agents: PEG 3350, PEG 3350+E and PEG 4000. While there is no a priori reason for supposing that these will behave functionally differently as laxatives, one cannot necessarily assume equivalence. Secondly, there are dose differences: in two casesthe dose was titrated according to clinical response, subject to an upper limit; in one casea single titration was permitted, with add-in therapy being required beyond that; and in the other two studiesthere was a fixed dose regime. Finally, there are methodological concerns regarding the analysis of the Gremse et al studyin that the presented results exclude the patients who had withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, biasing the results in favour of lactulose.

### Management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [^115qxQYK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a major complication in oncology practice and must be approached aggressively. Every patient starting opioids should be thoroughly instructed in the management of this side effect. Prevention is the key and use of agents such as senna and a stool softener with the initiation of therapy is mandatory, with rapid titration if the initial dose is not effective. At the first sign of constipation, agents such as bisacodyl should be added rapidly. Other agents then can be added as necessary. Fecal impaction must always be considered and it should be recognized that it may lead to other symptoms such as increased pain, urinary difficulties, or nausea and vomiting. In summary, the words of Dame Cicely Saunders, founder of the hospice movement, must be kept in mind: "Remember the bowels".

METHODS

Literature search

PubMed and Embase were searched from 2004 through July 2020 using the following search terms: (constipation OR opioid-induced constipation) AND (laxatives, stimulant OR laxatives, osmotic OR laxatives, irritant OR laxatives, bulk OR fecal softeners OR stool softener OR sorbitol OR magnesium OR milk of magnesia OR magnesium sulfate OR magnesium sulphate OR bisacodyl OR calcium polycarbophil OR polyethylene glycol OR PEG OR senna OR ispaghula OR bran OR celandin OR docusate OR aloevera OR aloe vera OR poloxalkol OR mineral oil OR glycerin OR glycerine OR psyllium OR methylcellulose OR herbal remedies OR traditional medicine OR Chinese herbal OR plantain OR doxinate OR prune OR kiwi OR fiber OR iberogast OR STW 5 OR sodium picosulfate OR macrogol OR sennosides OR inulin). Limits on the search were English language, randomized clinical trial, adults, and human.

Selection criteria

Abstracts of articles were screened, potentially relevant studies published in full were reviewed, and the following selection criteria were applied for inclusion: (i) randomized controlled trial (placebo or active comparator), (ii) parallel or cross over design, (iii) established definition of constipation (preferably ROME criteria), (iv) minimum duration of 4 weeks of active treatment, and (v) well-defined clinical endpoints. Studies evaluating colonic cleansing before colonoscopy or surgery, acute constipation indications (typically 1–2 days or weeks in duration), and patients with irritable bowel syndrome and/or evacuation disorders were excluded. Certain studies in patients with chronic comorbidities (i.e. chronic kidney disease [CKD]) were included.

Data extraction and analysis

Articles that met inclusion criteria were independently reviewed by both authors, and relevant data were extracted. This included therapeutic and control agent(s), study design, number of patients, mean age or age range, sex, study duration, outcome measures, efficacy, and safety outcomes.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^116qJSgW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

LAXATIVES

Laxatives can be classified as: lubricant, emollients, stimulants, osmotic, and rectal laxatives (Table 1). The osmotic laxatives are generally the first choice and include nonabsorbable sugars (lactulose), saline (magnesium hydroxide), and polyethylene glycol.

TABLE 1
Main Types of Laxatives

A recent review based on evidence evaluated the efficacy and safety of laxatives in CC, and only the solutions of polyethylene glycol and lactulose showed a high level of evidence and were assigned: grade A recommendation to polyethylene glycol and lactulose solutions, grade B to methylcellulose and sorbitol, and grade C for magnesium hydroxide. Paraffin and glycerin suppositories showed no scientific evidence.

Osmotic laxatives are indicated in patients with slow colonic transit, when other measures outlined above are not sufficient, and in patients with anismus. An adequate water intake is recommended during their use and monitoring the electrolyte levels; similarly, caution in patients with renal insufficiency should be taken, as magnesium salts may cause hypermagnesemia.

Lubricants are indicated less frequently because of their adverse effects. Mineral oil may inhibit the absorption of liposoluble vitamins and calcium. In children and elderly, it has been reported that mineral oil increases the risk for aspiration and lipoid pneumonia.

Stimulant or irritant laxatives can be aggressive and are rarely indicated as long-term treatment; they should be used in cases of transient constipation. Prolonged use of stimulant laxatives may cause melanosis coli, electrolyte, and acid-base balance disturbances; some intrinsic colonic nerve plexus injuries have been described, but there is no convincing evidence in humans. Their use is justified in palliative care and for occasional use, because of the development of tolerance. The efficacy and long-term safety is unclear, because studies that support it are of low scientific evidence.

Cascara (Rhamnus purshiana) has been used as laxative since a long time; the anthraquinone glycosides are responsible for most of its mechanism of action. It acts in the large bowel increasing peristalsis. It is available in several forms: dried, natural extract, liquid, or solid extract. Another commonly used product is Senna leaves (Cassia senna) for their cathartic properties. Patients with fecal impaction should require manual disimpaction and subsequently hypertonic enemas 1 to 2 per day until the left colon is cleared, along with increasing intake of fluids and fiber.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^115CZiKs]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

PEG versus lactulose (five studies)

In the first study,63 children with faecal impaction were recruited for an open label evaluation of PEG+E for the treatment of faecal impaction at a single paediatric centre. On completion of this phase of the study, 58 progressed to randomisation with lactulose or PEG+E as maintenance therapy. Of the five who were not randomised, two withdrew from the study and three failed to disimpact within 7 days. All those entering the study were between 2 and 11 years of age and had at least a 3-month history of constipation which had failed to be controlled during normal outpatient management.

A randomisation list was supplied by a third party (the study sponsor) in order to maintain concealment of allocation from the investigator and both medications were supplied as dry powders for the patient to reconstitute. Treatment was titrated by response and was not dictated by protocol. If required, patients were also allowed to use supplemental senna. The primary outcome measure was the number of successful defaecations per week on treatment, evaluated after 12 weeks.

The mean daily dose of PEG was 11.8 g and the mean dose of lactulose was 24.1 g. Overall, 31% of lactulose patients required senna, while no PEG+E patients needed senna. Of the 58 children who started, 10 failed to complete the study. Seven patients taking lactulose reimpacted and were therefore withdrawn, compared with none taking PEG+E. Two further lactulose patients withdrew from the study, while one PEG patient failed to complete a diary card. On-treatment efficacy data were available for 53 patients, which provided the basis for the primary intention to treat analysis: the mean number of successful defaecations per week was significantly greater in children given PEG+E than in those on lactulose: 9.4 vs 5.9, mean difference 3.5, p = 0.007.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^112t69Kc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults.

Methods

The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone.

Discussion

This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.

### Are senna based laxatives safe when used as long term treatment for constipation in children? [^11744gWU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Senna is a stimulant laxative commonly used by pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, and pediatric surgeons. Many clinicians avoid Senna for reasons such as tolerance or side effects but this has little scientific justification. We recently found several patients we were caring for developed perineal blistering during the course of Senna treatment. Because of this we chose to review the literature to identify side effects in children taking this medication as well as to analyze our Center's experience with Senna's secondary effects.

Methods

We performed a literature review (MEDLINE, PUBMED) using the keywords of Senna, sen, sennosides and children, and pediatric and functional (idiopathic) constipation. We looked for articles with information regarding perineal blisters related to Senna as well as other secondary effects of Senna laxatives in children when used on a long-term basis. We also reviewed the charts of our patients who had previously taken Senna or are currently taking Senna, looking for adverse reactions.

Results

Eight articles in the literature reported perineal blisters after administration of Senna laxatives in 28 patients. Of those occurrences, 18 patients (64%) had accidental administration of Senna and 10 (36%) had Senna prescribed as a long term treatment. All of the blistering episodes were related to high dose, night-time accidents, or intense diarrhea with a long period of stool to skin contact. At our institution, from 2014 to 2017, we prescribed Senna and have recorded data to 640 patients. During the study period, 17 patients (2.2%) developed blisters during their treatment. Patients who developed blisters had higher doses 60mg/day; 60 [12–100] vs. 17.5 [1.7–150] (p < 0.001). All of the blistering episodes were related to night-time accidents, with a long period of stool to skin contact. 83 (13%) patients presented minor side effects such as abdominal cramping, vomiting or diarrhea which resolved once the type of laxatives were changed or enemas were started. The doses of Senna was not significantly different in these patients 15mg/day [4.4–150] vs. 17.5mg/day [1.5–150]. There were no other long-term side effects from Senna found in the pediatric literature for long-term treatment besides abdominal cramping or diarrhea during the first weeks of administration. We found no evidence of tolerance to Senna in our review.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of information in the literature regarding side effects of sennosides as a long-term therapy, and to our knowledge, this is the first review of Senna side effects in children. Senna induced dermatitis is rare, but may occur when patients need a higher dose. All of the cases described had a long period of exposure of the skin to stool. Besides the perineal rash with blisters, we could find no other described major side effect with Senna administration in the pediatric population or evidence of the frequently mentioned concern of the development of tolerance to Senna. Pediatric caregivers should advise families of the rare side effect of skin blistering and educate them to change the diaper frequently in children who are not toilet- trained to reduce stool to skin exposure. We can conclude from this review that Senna is a safe treatment option for constipation in children.

### The effect of food, vitamin, or mineral supplements on chronic constipation in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Ay6E2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over-the-counter supplements are commonly used to manage chronic constipation; however, their efficacy remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of food, vitamin or mineral supplements on stool output, gut transit time, symptoms, and quality of life in adults with chronic constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Studies were identified using electronic databases, backward citation, and hand-searching abstracts. RCTs reporting administration of food supplements (e.g., fruit extract supplements), vitamin or mineral supplements in adults with chronic constipation were included. Studies administering whole foods (e.g., fruits) were excluded. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with Cochrane RoB 2.0. Relative risks (RR), mean differences (MD), or standardized mean differences (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were calculated using a random-effects model.

Key Results

Eight RCTs (787 participants) were included, investigating kiwifruit (n = 3 RCTs), senna (n = 2), magnesium oxide (n = 2), Ziziphus jujuba (n = 1), and Malva Sylvestris (n = 1) supplements. Kiwifruit supplements did not impact stool frequency (MD 0.24 bowel movements/week [-0.32, 0.80]; p = 0.40) or consistency (MD -0.11 Bristol points [-0.31, 0.09], p = 0.29). Overall, 61% responded to senna and 28% to control; however, this did not reach statistical significance (RR 2.78, [0.93, 8.27]; p = 0.07). Overall, 68% responded to magnesium oxide and 19% to control (RR 3.32 [1.59, 6.92]; p = 0.001). Magnesium oxide improved stool frequency (MD 3.72 bowel movements/week [1.41, 6.03]; p = 0.002) and consistency (MD 1.14 Bristol points [0.48, 1.79]; p = 0.0007).

Conclusions and Inferences

Magnesium oxide supplements are effective at improving cardinal symptoms of chronic constipation. Senna and kiwifruit supplements did not impact symptoms; however, findings were based on a small number of studies. Further research is required to investigate the effect of food supplements (e.g., kiwifruit supplements), as well as their whole food equivalents (e.g., whole kiwifruits) in chronic constipation.

### Review article: do stimulant laxatives damage the gut? A critical analysis of current knowledge [^115sKf8z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is a lack of compelling evidence on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or harmful effects on the colon associated with the recommended use of stimulant laxatives in humans. Many of the studies discussed in this review were of poor design, using only small sample sizes and/or lacked control for confounding factors, and thus, were not highly representative of the real-world use of stimulant laxatives. This indicates a need for well-designed epidemiological and/or clinical studies to formally address this research question.

A recent Rome Foundation working group document reiterated the recommendation of stimulant laxatives as a first-line intervention for functional constipation and highlighted that concerns regarding their long-term safety are unsubstantiated. Bisacodyl and senna have been available as branded medications for more than 70 years, and SPS for more than 50 years. Based on the available data, we conclude that patients should not be denied the benefits of these stimulant laxatives, which have been shown to improve quality of life and are associated with high patient satisfaction when used for constipation. Our critical review demonstrates that there are no significant gut safety concerns regarding the use of stimulant laxatives based on clinical observations over the long timeframe during which they have been available to patients with constipation. Stimulant laxatives have stood the test of time in the treatment of constipation and represent an important component of our therapeutic armamentarium.

### Transanal proximal rectosigmoidectomy. A new operation for severe chronic idiopathic constipation associated with megarectosigmoid [^1167M5Ez]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

At the severe end of the idiopathic constipation spectrum exist patients with chronic idiopathic constipation associated with an enormous megarectosigmoid, among whom few require surgery. We performed transanal proximal rectosigmoidectomy, involving preservation of a 5 cm rectal reservoir, to ameliorate inconsistent and unpredictable outcomes and fecal incontinence occurring in some patients operated on with other techniques.

Methods

We retrospectively observed patients with chronic idiopathic constipation with megarectosigmoid who underwent transanal proximal rectosigmoidectomy during July 2017-May 2018. We analyzed sex, age, operation indication, complications, functional outcome, and time of follow-up. We statistically compared the dosage of laxative before and after the procedure.

Results

Thirteen patients were included in the study. Median age during surgery was 8 years. In 9 cases, the indication for surgery was chronic intake of a daily high dose of Senna with failed weaning trials, and 4 had persistent fecal impaction with laxative-intolerance and refusal of rectal enemas. No intra/postoperative complications occurred. Currently, all 13 patients have daily voluntary bowel movements and no fecal accidents. Laxative dosage was significantly reduced (p = 0.007). Follow-up ranged 6–16 months.

Conclusion

Preliminary results suggest transanal proximal rectosigmoidectomy as an adequate alternative for patients requiring surgery for chronic idiopathic constipation with megarectosigmoid.

Increased rates of diarrhea (32%–53% vs 2%–5%) and abdominal pain (6%–25% vs 2%–3%) in comparison to placebo may limit the tolerability of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate. Senna was well tolerated in 1 study, but in the more recent study, 83.3% of subjects requested dose reduction of senna because of abdominal pain and diarrhea but completed the 4-week trial.

Overall, these data indicate that senna, bisacodyl, and sodium picosulfate are effective for the treatment of chronic constipation, although they are associated with increased potential for dose reduction or intolerance.
Senna: Level I Evidence, Grade A Recommendation
Bisacodyl: Level I Evidence, Grade B Recommendation
Sodium Picosulfate: Level I Evidence, Grade B Recommendation

### Impact of guideline awareness in public pharmacies on counseling of patients with acute or chronic constipation in a survey of pharmacy personnel [^1119MN2R]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We have conducted an online survey in July 2017 on the DocCheck Research platform using an existing panel of German HCPs. Based on the anonymous character of the survey, ethical committee approval was neither required nor recommended by applicable laws and regulations in Germany at the time the survey was performed. As participants were recruited from an existing panel of HCPs having indicated their willingness to contribute to surveys like this, additional participant consent was not required. The survey was planned to include about 200 HCPs working in public pharmacies with about equal representation of PHs and PTs (actual participation 104 PHs and 97 PTs).

The survey first asked whether participants had ever done a dedicated search for treatment recommendations for acute and chronic constipation (yes/no). If yes, a follow-up question asked which sources were used routinely to obtain information on constipation (seven options plus "other, to be specified"; multiple nominations possible). Thereafter, the survey presented two hypothetical cases typical for a pharmacy setting. One was a 62-year old woman with chronic constipation, diagnosed by a physician as chronic functional constipation. The other was a 42-year old woman planning a vacation trip and knowing from previous trips that she often suffers from acute constipation during such trips; she now wished to prophylactically buy a medicine for acute constipation to be used if needed. The verbatim German text of the case descriptions and an English translation are shown in the Online Supplement. Following each case presentation, participants were requested to rank choices for recommendation from the typical portfolio available in Germany, representing the ten most often recommended treatment options (bisacodyl, SPS, macrogol, lactulose, anthrachinones (e.g. extracts from Senna leaves or fruits), salinic laxatives (e.g. MgSO 4 or Na 2 SO 4), glycerin, enema, bulk-forming agents and "others" (to be identified if selected)). Options were presented in random order and participants were asked to perform ranking by on-screen drag and drop. An open question asked for the rationale behind their top-three recommendations. The next two questions asked to rank the ten options for efficacy and tolerability, respectively, again with a request to provide a rationale for the top-three choices. A separate question asked to rank the ten options about strength of evidence and underlying reasons (for the top 3 choices). A final question inquired whether the addition of electrolytes was required in macrogol preparations in the treatment of constipation. Thereafter, a summary excerpt of medical treatment recommendations from the applicable German guideline was provided (verbatim text and English translation in Online Supplement). Thereafter, each of the original cases and questions was asked again to explore a possible change of recommendations and underlying reasons.

### Adverse effects of laxatives [^116yvc2P]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Laxatives are among the most commonly used drugs or additives. Most are quite safe when used judiciously, intermittently when possible, and in the absence of contraindications. Bulking agents and nonabsorbable compounds such as lactulose can cause bloating but have very few serious adverse effects except for the allergic reaction to psyllium preparations. Osmotic laxatives containing poorly absorbable ions such as magnesium or phosphate can cause metabolic disturbances, particularly in the presence of renal impairment. However, if taken intermittently, in the absence of conditions such as ileus or bowel obstruction, they have few adverse effects. Polyethylene glycol solutions are emerging as an effective and safe mode of treatment for chronic constipation. Of stimulant laxatives, senna compounds and bisacodyl are the most commonly used. Although there are data to support the neoplastic potential of this class of drugs in in vitro studies, epidemiologic data in humans so far has not established a clear link between these laxatives and colonic neoplasia. The link between stimulant laxatives and structural changes, such as the "cathartic colon" or enteric nerve damage, is not well established either. Danthron compounds should be avoided because of hepatotoxicity.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^111Hcqki]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The current FDA responder criteria for chronic idiopathic constipation trials are based on a CSBM weekly response (i.e. ≥ 3 CSBMs/week plus an increase of ≥ 1 CSBM/week from baseline). These were not used in any of the studies. Other measures of outcome included response rates (varying definitions), ease of defecation, straining, symptoms, transit times, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as the Patient Global Impression of Change, the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms, and the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life. It should be noted that PRO measures have become increasingly important clinical tools, and the US FDA developed a draft guidance statement on their use for GI conditions. Another limitation was that there were only single studies available for many of the treatment categories. Consequently, the lack of confirmatory studies resulted in both a lower level of evidence category and a lower grade of recommendation. Most studies were of very short duration (typically 4 weeks) except for PEG studies, which ranged up to 6 months. Given that constipation is often a chronic problem, it behooves all investigators to consider longer-term (3- to 12-month) studies to provide confidence regarding durability of response. If the indication of an OTC product is for occasional and/or short-term use, then a 4- to 6-week study design may be appropriate, with stricter appraisal of changes in daily stool habits, ideally using validated paper form stool diary or a recently validated electronic constipation stool APP diary.

Overall, PEG was the OTC laxative with the most robust clinical evidence (i.e. 3 placebo-controlled trials with quality scores of 5, 5, and 4), and it and senna are the only OTC agents with level I evidence and grade A recommendations. For PEG, this recommendation remains unchanged with newer studies providing further evidence supporting its use as a first-line treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation. PEG is highly effective with similar or superior efficacy to other OTC and prescription therapies and is well tolerated with long-term administration. In comparison studies, adverse events associated with PEG were similar in pattern and frequency to those of lactulose and tegaserod (increased rates of headaches with tegaserod) and lower in frequency compared with prucalopride (68% vs 85%) and naloxegol (17% vs 24%).

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^111Yurvw]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna randomized controlled trial evidence: One placebo-controlled RCT randomly assigned participants to 1 g of senna (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 28 days. Senna increased complete spontaneous bowel movements per week (MD 7.60, 95% CI 5.90–9.30), and the response rate might be higher than placebo (RR 5.25, 95% CI 2.05–13.47). Participants taking senna may have higher rates of diarrhea, 175 more per 1,000 (from 100 fewer to 1,000 more), and no participants in the senna and placebo arms experienced a severe treatment-related adverse event. Dosing in the single RCT was 1 g by mouth daily for 4 weeks; most commercially available senna products contain 8–9 mg per tablet; and 83% of participants randomized to senna reduced their daily dose during the trial.

### Constipation in adults [^11497xFa]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and depend in part on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, bulk-forming laxatives, faecal softeners, stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, prostaglandin derivatives, and 5-HT4 agonists in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 51systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerol/glycerine suppositories, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, lubiprostone, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, prucalopride, and sterculia.

### Polyethylene glycol vs. sodium phosphate for bowel preparation: a treatment arm meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11291s9w]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Descriptive findings

One hundred seventy four abstracts were obtained from 1990 through 2008 using MEDLINE and EMBASE; 50 were excluded as they were either published prior to 1990 (n = 18), involved bowel preparation for non colonoscopy use (n = 11), were published in foreign language (n = 8), or were non-randomized controlled trials (n = 13). Of the 124 randomized controlled trials included for full text review, 53 trials were excluded. The number of articles and reasons for exclusion were as follows: trials which included a pediatric population (n = 6); trials that did not include PEG or NaP (n = 24); trials with no categorical data (n = 12); and trials with non-traditional doses of either prep (e.g. single dose 3L or 6L PEG solutions regimen, single dose NaP (45 mL or 90 mL; n = 11) were excluded (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart diagram for the studies identified in the meta-analysis.

For analysis, we included 71 randomized controlled trials involving 10,201 patients. Trial aggregation by treatment arm resulted in the following prep arms: 4 liter PEG with and without adjunctive medications (e.g. metoclopramide, dulcolax); 2 liter PEG; split-dose PEG; NaP solution - two 45 mL doses with and without adjunctive medications; and NaP tablets. All low volume PEG trials (i.e. 2 liter) invariably used an adjunctive medication such as bisacodyl (70%), senna (20%), and magnesium citrate or ascorbic acid (10%). Trials that used split dose PEG regimen either divided a 4 liter dose into 2 liter the day before and 2 liter on the day of the procedure or divided a 3 liter dose into 2 liter the day before and 1 liter the day of the procedure.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^111TNXHu]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic maintenance therapy in pediatric refractory constipation: The NASPGHAN/ESPGHAN guideline from 2014 suggests polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 as the most effective pharmacologic treatment for maintenance therapy. Since publication, bisacodyl and senna have been shown to be safe and effective in pediatric patients. Per the expert author's opinion, some pediatric patients referred to a pediatric neurogastroenterologist can avoid invasive testing with a maintenance stimulant laxative.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^111Huq3A]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association–American College of Gastroenterology guideline — limitations, evidence gaps, and implementation — highlights heterogeneity and scope constraints. It notes "clinical trials did not uniformly evaluate interventions for patient important outcomes on efficacy, adverse effects, and tolerability", and "there was a paucity of data for the most commonly used treatments of CIC such as fiber, lactulose, senna, and docusate". There was "variability in the definition of inclusion criteria, efficacy, and tolerability outcomes", and "Most of the included studies followed the patients for the short term, and the safety and tolerance of these medications in the long term is not well studied". For comparisons, "we grouped individual drugs against placebo arms and did not aim to inform on the relative efficacy of pharmacological agents", and "Network meta-analysis is an appropriate statistical method to facilitate indirect comparison against a common comparator such as placebo or other active treatment". Scope is limited as "This guideline is limited to covering pharmacological interventions for the treatment of CIC in otherwise healthy adults and does not apply to pediatric populations or to individuals who are pregnant or with opioid-induced constipation or malignancy". Regarding economics and participation, "we did not perform formal cost-effectiveness analyses" and "There was no patient representative in the guideline development panel, which is a limitation for this study".

Propensity score matched (PSM) association of laxative types with incidence of dementia

a Models were adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education attainment, current employment status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet, BMI, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, depression, cholesterol levels, constipation, and genetic risk. CI Confidence interval, HR Hazard ratio

Furthermore, we found that compared to non-laxative exposed participants, those with use of senna (HR, 1.67; 95 CI: 1.34–2.09), lactulose (HR, 1.50; 95% CI: 1.24–1.81), and docusate (HR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.54–2.91) were positively associated with the risk of developed incident dementia (Supplementary Table 7). We further evaluated the association between the dosage of senna, lactulose, and docusate and the risk of incident dementia. Compared to non-laxative exposed participants, those with low and high dosage of senna was associated with 1.53 (95% CI: 1.11–2.11) and 1.82 (95% CI: 1.34–2.47) greater risk of dementia (Supplementary Table 8). Likewise, high dosage of lactulose (HR, 1.88; 95% CI: 1.49–2.37) and docusate (HR, 2.38; 95% CI: 1.57–3.62) was associated with increased risk of dementia.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112VG6kk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background pain control

If the patient is opioid naïve, commence a safe opioid at the lowest effective dose (select an opioid that does not have clinically relevant active metabolites that depend on renal excretion) and titrate to effect. The authors recognise that opioids are not considered appropriate for chronic pain. However, this is an acute pain arising in response to tissue injury and death and therefore, we recommend an opioid as first line therapy.

In opioid naïve patients who are starting an opioid for the first time a starting dose of alfentanil 0.5 mg continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) over 24 h is proposed. This is approximately equivalent to morphine 7.5 mg/24 h by subcutaneous infusion. The authors recommend alfentanil as it is not removed by dialysis, it does not cause toxicity in an ESRD population and it occupies a low volume in syringe drivers. This guidance is drawn from literature on the use of opioids in cancer patients with severe and end stage terminal illness and is supported by the clinical pharmacology literature. Fentanyl by CSCI is an alternative.

Where the patient is not opioid naïve, convert their existing opioid to alfentanil by CSCI. Palliative medicine team can help with conversions if this is outside of the usual scope of practice of the general clinician. Titrate daily to either pain relief or toxicity. Increases in background analgesia are usually of the order of 30–50% every 24 h having checked for any signs or symptoms of opioid neurotoxicity. Symptoms of neurotoxicity include troublesome confusion or cognitive slowing, misperceptions or visual hallucinations. If neurotoxicity occurs reduce the dose of opioids by 30% and add adjuvant analgesics e.g. gabapentinoid.

Thirty percentage of patients will experience nausea for 3–5 days on starting an opioid. Ensure that an antiemetic is available for use as and when needed e.g. metoclopramide 10 mg per oral (PO) or subcutaneously (SC) three times a day. Patients will experience constipation and need to be prescribed a regular daily laxative. Senna 7.5 mg twice a day is recommended as a starting dose.

### Bowel preparation for pediatric colonoscopy: report of the NASPGHAN endoscopy and procedures committee [^115MbN7f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric colonoscopy bowel preparation — adjunctive bisacodyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-3350 efficacy and dosing are reported as follows: The addition of 5 mg of bisacodyl to 2 g/kg of PEG-3350, given for 2 days before the colonoscopy, was reported effective with 95% compliance, and the right and left colon were rated excellent or good in 92% and 93% of children, respectively. In a direct comparison between PEG-3350 and senna in a study of 30 children, PEG-3350 was found to be more effective; the PEG-3350 dose was 1.5 g/kg divided twice per day for 2 days, whereas senna was 1.5 mL (26.4 mg sennosides) for children 6 to 12 years or 30 mL (52.8 mg sennosides) for 12 to 21 years, and 88% of patients given PEG-3350 had a good cleanout versus 29% with senna. A preparation approved in adults and sold in Canada as Pico-Salax was reported to have good outcomes in 97% of patients who received it during 2 days with a 2-day clear liquid diet.

### Bowel preparation using 2-L split-dose polyethylene glycol regimen plus lubiprostone versus 4-L split-dose polyethylene glycol regimen: a randomized controlled trial [^1137tPeD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colon disease assessment and colorectal cancer screening currently rely on colonoscopy as the standard approach. Clear mucosal visualization, which depends on the quality of the bowel preparation, is essential for detecting lesions and may contribute to the early detection of colorectal cancer. Suboptimal preparation can hinder detection of smaller lesions, lengthen the procedure time, increase the risk of adverse events related to the procedure, and increase costs due to the need for repeated examinations and/or reducing the interval between surveillance examinations. Meanwhile, 12.5–20% of exams involved inadequate bowel preparation.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a balanced electrolyte solution that is associated with minimal water and electrolyte absorption or secretion during total gut perfusion. It is currently the most commonly used solution for bowel preparation. However, the large volume of 4 Liter (L) required is poorly tolerated and can lead to nausea, cramping, and vomiting. A pooled analysis of 15 trials found that 29% of patients were unable to completely ingest the PEG solution, which often results in unsuccessful bowel preparation and incomplete visualization. Low-volume PEG has been combined with stimulant laxatives (e.g. bisacodyl or senna) in order to improve bowel cleansing and reduce the volume of PEG required, but due to adverse events (including ischemic colitis caused by bisacodyl and severe abdominal pain caused by senna), this combination is not widely used in general practice.

Lubiprostone (LB) is a locally acting activator of type 2 chloride channels in the gastrointestinal tract that enhances intestinal fluid secretion, resulting in softened stools and increased intestinal transit without the loss of either net intravascular fluid or electrolytes. After oral administration of a single dose of 24 µg LB, the plasma concentration peaks within approximately 1 h, and the half-life of LB is approximately 3 h. LB is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Thailand FDA for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, and it is generally well tolerated with an excellent safety profile.

The present study aimed to determine whether the efficiency of bowel cleansing with a combination of LB pretreatment and low-volume (2 L) split-dose PEG is equal to that of high-volume (4 L) split-dose PEG. Moreover, we aimed to compare cecal intubation rate, procedure time, withdrawal time, polyp detection rate, adenoma detection rate, patient satisfaction, compliance, willingness to repeat the preparation regimen, and adverse events associated with each regimen.

### The use of senna with docusate for postoperative constipation after pelvic reconstructive surgery: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116hSYyE]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare time to first bowel movement (BM) after surgery in subjects randomized to placebo or senna with docusate.

Study Design

Ninety-six subjects completed a baseline 7-day bowel diary before and after surgery. After pelvic reconstructive surgery, the subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 45) or senna (8.6 mg) with docusate (50 mg) (n = 48). Time to first BM and postoperative use of magnesium citrate were compared.

Results

There was a significant difference in the time to first BM in those receiving senna with docusate vs placebo (3.00 ± 1.50 vs 4.05 ± 1.50 days; P < .002). More subjects in the placebo group needed to use magnesium citrate to initiate a bowel movement (43.6% vs 7.0%; P < .001).

Conclusion

The use of senna with docusate decreases time to first BM in those undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery compared with placebo. Subjects using senna with docusate are also significantly less likely to use magnesium citrate.

### Low-volume bowel preparation is inferior to standard 4 1 polyethylene glycol [^115Q9HBr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Four liters or more of orally taken polyethylene glycol solution (PEG) has proved to be an effective large-bowel cleansing method prior to colonoscopy. The problem has been the large volume of fluid and its taste, which is unacceptable to some examinees. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of 2 l PEG combined with senna compared with 4 l PEG for bowel preparation.

Methods

The design was a single-center, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded study with parallel assignment, in the setting of the Endoscopy Unit of Umeå University Hospital. Outpatients (n = 490) scheduled for colonoscopy were enrolled. The standard-volume arm received 4 l PEG, and the low-volume arm received 36 mg senna glycosides in tablets and 2 l PEG. The cleansing result (primary endpoint) was assessed by the endoscopist using the Ottawa score. The patients rated the subjective grade of ease of taking the bowel preparation. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

There were significantly more cases with poor or inadequate bowel cleansing after the low-volume alternative with senna and 2 l PEG (22/203) compared with after 4 l PEG (8/196, p = 0.027). The low-volume alternative was better tolerated by the examinees: 119/231 rated the treatment as easy to take compared with 88/238 in the 4 l PEG arm (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

4 l PEG treatment is better than 36 mg senna and 2 l PEG as routine colonic cleansing before colonoscopy because of fewer failures.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^114vJshR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Stimulant agents

Stimulant laxatives can be subdivided into 2 categories: diphenylmethane derivatives (e.g. bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate) and plant-based anthraquinones (e.g. senna, aloe, and cascara). All act locally at the nerve plexus of smooth muscle in the intestine to stimulate colonic motility.

Four trials using diphenylmethane derivatives (Table 3) were identified in the current analysis. Two (1 bisacodyl, 1 sodium picosulfate) were placebo controlled. Both were large, rigorously designed studies (methodological scores = 5), and active treatment with both agents was associated with significant increases in mean complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs)/week (the primary endpoint in both trials) compared with placebo. In a comparative trial, bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate demonstrated similar efficacy (i.e. number of bowel movements [BMs]/stool consistency) and safety. Bisacodyl proved inferior to the cholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine in the final study based on BM frequency and a visual analog scale assessing pain on a 0- to 10-point scale.

Two studies also evaluated the anthraquinone senna (methodological score = 5; Table 3). In the first, senna was superior to placebo and had similar efficacy to a Chinese herbal preparation used for constipation (MaZiRenWan) as assessed by complete response rates (i.e. increase of ≥ 1 CSBM/week). Senna was also superior to placebo for secondary endpoints, including frequency of CSBMs and spontaneous BM (SBMs), severity of constipation, and sensation of straining. In a recently published study from Asia, senna (at a starting dose of 1 g/d, which could subsequently be reduced) was superior to placebo in improving overall symptoms (primary endpoint), stool frequency, and QoL; however, the doses of senna consumed were significantly greater than those used in clinical practice in the United States.

### High-dose senna compared with conventional PEG-ES lavage as bowel preparation for elective colonoscopy: a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded trial [^1139C5Qm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and patient acceptance of an oral high dose of senna to conventional polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ES) in adults undergoing elective colonoscopy.

Methods

Consecutive outpatients referred for elective colonoscopy were prospectively randomly assigned to receive, the day before the procedure, either 24 tablets of 12 mg senna, divided into two doses at 1 p.m. and 9 p.m. (senna group, n = 191), or standard 4-L PEG-ES (PEG-ES group, n = 92). The overall quality of colon cleansing (primary outcome measure) and cleansing in the right colon were evaluated using the Aronchick scoring scale (1 = excellent to 4 = inadequate) by the investigator/endoscopist who was blinded to the treatment assignment. Patient acceptance and the safety of the preparation were assessed by a nurse, using a structured questionnaire covering compliance with the dosing, overall tolerance of the preparation (1 = none or mild discomfort to 4 = severely distressing), and adverse events.

Results

The quality of colon cleansing, overall tolerance of the preparation, and compliance were significantly better with senna; overall cleansing was excellent or good in 90.6% of patients in the senna group and in 79.7% in the PEG-ES group (p = 0.003). The percentage of procedures rescheduled because of insufficient colon cleansing was 7.3% in the PEG-ES group and 2.6% in the senna group (p = 0.035). Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed the PEG-ES preparation as negative independent predictor of unsuccessful bowel cleansing. The incidence of adverse reactions was similar in the two groups; patients who received senna experienced significantly less nausea and vomiting, but more abdominal pain.

Conclusions

An oral high dose of senna is a valid alternative to standard PEG-ES for outpatient colonoscopy preparation.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^112fjcaE]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Opioid-induced adverse effects — constipation and nausea/vomiting evidence in adults with cancer: For prevention of opioid-induced constipation, "studies designed to explore strategies… suggest that the stimulant laxative senna provides effective control without the addition of the softener docusate". For treatment, "There was moderate-quality evidence that naloxegol improved bowel function over 2 weeks in adults with cancer, with an increased risk of adverse events such as diarrhea compared with placebo", and "methylnaltrexone was associated with more laxations in 24 hours than placebo". For nausea/vomiting, evidence on opioid switching showed "no clear conclusions", and an RCT randomized "120 patients… to prophylactic prochlorperazine (5 mg) or placebo, three times daily for 5 days", with complete response "in 69.5%… and 63.3%… (P = 0.47)". Evidence for other side effects remains limited: "There is also very little evidence to guide the management of other opioid side effects, such as cognitive impairment and sedation".

### Efficacy and safety of traditional medical therapies for chronic constipation: systematic review [^1152dLBM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Constipation is common, and its treatment is unsatisfactory. Although many agents have been tried, there are limited data to support their use. Our aim was to undertake a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of traditional medical therapies for chronic constipation and to make evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

We searched the English literature for drug trials evaluating treatment of constipation by using MEDLINE and PUBMED databases from 1966 to 2003. Only studies that were randomized, conducted on adult subjects, and published as full manuscripts were included. Studies were assigned a quality score based on published methodology. Standard forms were used to abstract data regarding study design, duration, outcome measures, and adverse events. By using the cumulative evidence of published data for each agent, recommendations were made regarding their use following the United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.

Results

Good evidence (Grade A) was found to support the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and tegaserod. Moderate evidence (Grade B) was found to support the use of psyllium, and lactulose. There was a paucity of quality data regarding many commonly used agents including milk of magnesia, senna, bisacodyl, and stool softeners.

Conclusions

There is good evidence to support the use of PEG, tegaserod, lactulose, and psyllium. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of trials for many commonly used agents. These aspects should be considered when designing trials comparing new agents with traditional therapies because their use may not be well validated.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^117JZwKY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

Constipation is commonly treated with over-the-counter (OTC) products whose efficacy and safety remain unclear. We performed a systematic review of OTC therapies for chronic constipation and provide evidence-based recommendations.

METHODS:

We searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials of ≥ 4-week duration that evaluated OTC preparations between 2004 and 2020. Studies were scored using the US Preventive Services Task Force criteria (0–5 scale) including randomization, blinding, and withdrawals. The strengths of evidence were adjudicated within each therapeutic category, and recommendations were graded (A, B, C, D, and I) based on the level of evidence (level I, good; II, fair; or III, poor).

RESULTS:

Of 1,297 studies identified, 41 met the inclusion criteria. There was good evidence (grade A recommendation) for the use of the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the stimulant senna; moderate evidence (grade B) for psyllium, SupraFiber, magnesium salts, stimulants (bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate), fruit-based laxatives (kiwi, mango, prunes, and ficus), and yogurt with galacto-oligosaccharide/prunes/linseed oil; and insufficient evidence (grade I) for polydextrose, inulin, and fructo-oligosaccharide. Diarrhea, nausea, bloating, and abdominal pain were common adverse events, but no serious adverse events were reported.

DISCUSSION:

The spectrum of OTC products has increased and quality of evidence has improved, but methodological issues including variability in study design, primary outcome measures, trial duration, and small sample sizes remain. We found good evidence to recommend polyethylene glycol or senna as first-line laxatives and moderate evidence supporting fiber supplements, fruits, stimulant laxatives, and magnesium-based products. For others, further validation with more rigorously designed studies is warranted.

6 WHAT CAN THESE DATA TELL US ABOUT BISACODYL?

6.1 What are the key aspects of bisacodyl pharmacology that clinicians should remember?

Bisacodyl is a prodrug metabolized in the intestinal mucosa and not by bacteria, such as with other stimulant laxatives like picosulfate, senna, and cascara. This suggests that a more consistent effect of bisacodyl is possible, with less influence from factors affecting gut microbiota. Bisacodyl is available as oral (5‐layer enteric‐coated tablets) and rectal (suppository) formulations, permitting a variable immediacy of effect; bowel movement occurs in approximately 6–12 hours following administration with oral tablets and approximately 20 minutes with the suppository (in some cases an effect occurred 45 minutes after administration). The available oral dosing for adults is 5–10 mg once daily. On the basis of randomised controlled trial findings,5 mg seem to be better tolerated. Therefore, it is sensible to recommend treatment initiation with 5 mg and subsequent dose adjustment on an individualised basis. However, as studies with formal fixeddosed comparison of the 5 and 10 mg dosages are not available, such a comparison may provide additional information on efficacy and tolerability of the two‐dose strength. Available dosing in the rectal form is 10 mg for adults, adolescents, and children above 10 years of age, and 5 mg for children aged 4–10 years. With both formulations, the active metabolite of bisacodyl has no relevant systemic absorption.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^112rvVDH]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

OIBD is an increasing problem due to the wider use of opioids, including the treatment of nonmalignant pain. Current knowledge is certainly insufficient regarding many aspects of OIC, and more so of OIBD as reflected by our votes regarding the level of evidence (Appendix). Though this holds particularly true for the management of the opioid side effects on the upper GI tract, recommendations can be derived from what we know at present (Figure 2). As only about half of the patients taking opioid experience OIC, a general comedication with a laxative or an opiate antagonist would be an overtreatment. Rather, awareness of the problem is mandatory for the treating physician. In addition, prophylaxis could be adjusted to the perceived risks of OiC in a particular patient; for example, it could be prescribed to those who have had constipation as a problem before starting opioids. However, this issue deserves further study in the future.

Figure 2
Treatment guidance algorithm for patients initiating opioid treatment and patients presenting with OIC. Patients with previous constipation not responding well to laxatives and given an opioid therapy on top are probably best treated with an agonist-antagonist plus a laxative. *First choice laxatives — bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna, macrogol. OIC = opioid-induced constipation.

The conventional laxatives, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, macrogol, and senna, seem to be the first choice to treat OIC. The new laxatives, linaclotide, lubiprostone, and prucalopride, may also be effective in selected patients but do not seem to be superior to PAMORAs based on the presently available indirect comparisons. PAMORAs clearly have a proven effect on OIC. Whether PAMORAs have advantages over laxatives through the addressing of OIBD, and not only OIC, needs to be shown in randomized double-blind comparative trials.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^114rMMwy]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — senna: Recommendation 6 states that in adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna. Implementation considerations state that while the trials were conducted for 4 wk, longer term use is probably appropriate, but data are needed to better understand tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used doses in practice, the panel suggests starting at lower dose and increase if no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Constipation in adults [^116QhkJz]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and in part depend on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, and of other interventions, in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerine suppositories, glycerol, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, sterculia.

### Half doses of PEG-ES and senna vs. high-dose senna for bowel cleansing before colonoscopy: a randomized, investigator-blinded trial [^1146vYxz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients' compliance with and tolerance of large-volume polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ES) have prompted continuous investigation with alternative forms of cleansing. High-dose senna is superior to PEG-ES for the quality of bowel cleansing, patient compliance, and tolerance, but its acceptance may be influenced by the incidence of abdominal pain. We hypothesized that a combination of half doses of PEG-ES and senna could minimize the incidence of abdominal pain without affecting the quality of bowel preparation.

Methods

This randomized, investigator-blinded trial has been conducted on consecutive outpatients scheduled for elective colonoscopy at a single community-based hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 12 tablets of 12 mg senna and 2 l of PEG-ES (half-dose group, HDG) or 24 tablets of senna divided in two doses (senna group, SG) the day before colonoscopy. The main outcome measures were the quality of colon cleansing (Aronchick scoring scale) and the incidence of preparation-related abdominal pain. Secondary outcome measures were patients' compliance with the cleansing regimen, overall tolerability, prevalence of predefined side effects, and quality of right colon cleansing.

Results

A total of 296 patients were enrolled (HDG = 151 and SG = 145). Overall cleansing was excellent to good in 90.1 and 88.3% patients in HDG and SG, respectively (P = 0.62). Preparation-related moderate-to-severe abdominal pain was reported by 6% patients in HDG and 15.2% in SG (P = 0.009). No significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

The regimen combining half doses of PEG-ES and senna provides high-quality bowel preparation and acceptable patient tolerance, with less abdominal pain compared with high-dose senna.

### Senna versus magnesium oxide for the treatment of chronic constipation: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113FejR8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This is the first prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a stimulant laxative compared with an osmotic agent for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation.

Methods

Patients were randomly administered stimulant laxative (senna, 1.0 g), osmotic agent (magnesium oxide [MgO], 1.5 g), or placebo for 28 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was overall symptom improvement. Secondary endpoints were spontaneous bowel movement (SBM), complete SBM, and patient assessment of constipation quality of life (QOL).

Results

Ninety patients (mean age, 42 years; 93% women; mean duration of symptoms, 9.9 years) were enrolled; all completed the study. The response rate for overall improvement was 11.7% in the placebo group, 69.2% in the senna group, and 68.3% in the MgO group (P < 0.0001). Change in SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Similarly, change in complete SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.01). On the patient assessment of constipation QOL, significant improvements were seen in the senna and MgO groups compared with those in the placebo group (senna, P < 0.05; MgO, P < 0.001). The frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events was 0%.

Discussion

Senna and MgO significantly improved the frequency of bowel movements and QOL score and seem to be effective in the treatment of constipation.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^114pWdtG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Oral high-dose stimulant laxatives — sennosides in pediatric refractory constipation note that sennosides should be administered 6–12 h before the goal time for the bowel movement for optimal success; common adverse effects include stomach cramping and diarrhea, contact dermatitis can occur, and dermatitis occurs primarily with high-dose sennosides and prolonged stool-to-skin exposure; although pediatric RCTs in RC are lacking, the author's expert opinion is that stimulant laxatives such as sennosides are beneficial, and Recommendation 4.1.1 states high-dose sennoside is a mainstay of management of RC and should be optimized before considering further options.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^112WZBfy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The gastroenterologist's point of view

In the absence of a response, it is advisable to give macrogol at the maximum recommended dose (250 mL twice daily) and, on the third day without evacuation, administer a stimulant (bisacodyl or senna).

If a patient is a responder, naloxegol can be continued for as long as the patient is receiving opioids. To date, available data on the use of naloxegol do not extend beyond 52 weeks.

The Board agree on the definition of four clinical scenarios:
Patients responding to naloxegol in the short term: dose maintained and interruption of the treatment contraindicated. No tolerance of mu receptors has been observed at enteric level. It is advisable to monitor renal function by evaluating creatinine levels. Given the lack of intermediate products, the substance is nontoxic and treatment can be considered safe in the long term. Drug metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system implies some warnings for patients taking the related inhibitors.
Patients responding to naloxegol in the short term and on a regimen of opioid rotation: consider a reduction of the dose and monitoring.
Patients responding to naloxegol in the short term and suffering from abdominal pain and bloating: consider a reduction of the dose and monitoring.
Patients not responding or not adequately responding to naloxegol in the short term: not advisable a dosage increase from 25 to 50 mg/day, as it would result in an increase in adverse effects, without leading to further improvement in efficacy.

### Effectiveness of senna vs polyethylene glycol as laxative therapy in children with constipation related to anorectal malformation [^115BpPSc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Constipation is present in 80% of children with corrected anorectal malformations, usually associated to rectal dilation and hypomotility. Osmotic laxatives are routinely used for idiopathic constipation. Senna is a stimulant laxative that produces contractions improving colonic motility without affecting the stool consistency. We designed this trial to study the effectiveness of Senna versus polyethylene glycol for the treatment of constipation in children with anorectal malformation.

Methods

A randomized controlled crossover design clinical trial, including a washout period, was conducted, including children with corrected anorectal malformations with fecal continence and constipation. The sample size was calculated for proportions (n = 28) according to available data for Senna. Effectiveness of laxative therapy was measured with a three variable construct: 1) daily bowel movement, 2) fecal soiling, 3) a "clean" abdominal x-ray. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and a Fisher's exact test for the outcome variable (effectiveness).

Results

The study was terminated early because the interim analysis showed a clear benefit toward Senna (p = 0.026). The sample showed a normal statistical distribution for the variables age and presence of megarectum. The maximum daily dose of Senna (sennosides A and B) was 38.7mg and 17g for polyethylene glycol. No adverse effects were identified.

Conclusion

Therapy with Senna should be the laxative treatment of choice as part of a bowel management program in children with repaired anorectal malformations and constipation, since the stimulation of colonic propulsion waves could lead to stool evacuation without modification of its consistency which can affect fecal continence.

Level Of Evidence

### Treatment of opioid-induced constipation: inducing laxation and understanding the risk of gastrointestinal perforation [^111uHDkm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives (eg, bisacodyl, senna) are generally recommended as first-line therapy for management of OIC in patients with or without cancer. Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are recommended for patients with or without cancer with OIC who have an inadequate response to laxative therapy. The subcutaneous formulation of the PAMORA methylnaltrexone is indicated for the treatment of OIC in adults with advanced illness or cancer pain who require opioid dosage escalation for palliative care. In addition, the oral PAMORAs (methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, naldemedine) and lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, are indicated in the United States for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic noncancer pain, including those with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent increases in their opioid dosage. – Although off-label use of oral prucalopride for OIC has been considered, the American Gastroenterological Association makes no recommendations for the use of this agent due to insufficient evidence supporting efficacy. Linaclotide and plecanatide have also been considered but are not indicated for OIC.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATION DURING TREATMENT OF OIC

Cases of GI perforation have been reported across the spectrum of laxation agents used for the treatment of OIC. All agents of the PAMORA class indicated for the treatment of OIC (methylnaltrexone, naldemedine, and naloxegol) have a class warning and precaution statement in the US prescribing information about the risk of GI perforation. – Prescribers are advised to consider the overall risk-benefit profile in patients with known or suspected lesions of the GI tract, monitor patients for severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain, and discontinue treatment if patients develop these symptoms. – Although the exact mechanism is unknown, GI perforation after initiation of OIC treatment may result from the laxation (bowel movement) process causing disruption of the GI lining, which already has compromised integrity related to other pathologic processes.

### Idiopathic constipation: a challenging but manageable problem [^112NzDz5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

A protocol to treat idiopathic constipation is presented.

Methods

A contrast enema is performed in every patient and, when indicated, patients are initially submitted to a "clean out" protocol. All patients are started on a Senna-based laxative. The initial dosage is empirically determined and adjusted daily, during a one week period, based on history and abdominal radiographs, until the amount of Senna that empties the colon is reached. The management is considered successful when patients empty their colon daily and stop soiling. If the laxatives dose provokes abdominal cramping, distension, and vomiting, without producing bowel movements, patients are considered nonmanageable.

Results

From 2005 to 2012, 215 patients were treated. 121 (56%) were males. The average age was 8.2years (range: 1–20). 160 patients (74%) presented encopresis. 67 patients (32%) needed a clean out. After one week, 181 patients (84%) achieved successful management, with an average Senna dose of 67mg (range: 5–175mg). In 34 patients (16%) the treatment was unsuccessful: 19 were nonmanageable, 3 noncompliant, and 12 continued soiling. At a later follow-up (median: 329days) the success rate for 174 patients was 81%.

Conclusion

We designed a successful protocol to manage idiopathic constipation. The key points are clean out before starting laxatives, individual adjustments of laxative, and radiological monitoring of colonic emptying.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^111mGPhd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Magnesium-containing agents

Magnesium-based compounds are laxatives that act by retaining water in the intestinal lumen, resulting in bulking and softening of stool. Magnesium salts have historically been classified as osmotic, saline, or mixed osmotic-saline laxatives with categorization dependent on the magnesium compound used. Although magnesium citrate is a stronger formulation with more characteristically osmotic properties, other agents including magnesium hydroxide, magnesium gluconate, and magnesium oxide or magnesium enriched water act as more gentle saline laxatives. Given the breadth of new studies evaluating different magnesium-based formulations, these results have been categorized and addressed separately from the other osmotic agents. This review identified 4 new relevant studies using magnesium-based regimens, 3 evaluating magnesium-rich water vs placebo (Table 4) with methodological scores of 5 (n = 2) and 4 (n = 1) and one evaluating magnesium oxide versus placebo or senna. The amount of elemental magnesium consumed in the 3 magnesium water studies varied from 105 mg/d (1,000 mL/d of water containing 105 mg/L Mg), 60 or 119 mg/d (500 or 1,000 mL/d of water containing 119 mg/L Mg) to 500 mg/d (500 mL/d of water containing 1,000 mg/L of Mg). None of the trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo for their primary endpoints (based on stool frequency per week or ROME II–based response), although various secondary endpoints, including stool frequency at alternative time points and stool consistency, were significantly improved. Magnesium-containing mineral water preparations were well tolerated with low rates of adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal distention). In the magnesium oxide study, subjects were administered a total of 1.5 g in 3 divided doses and reported significant overall improvements in constipation, SBMs, CSBMs, and QoL when compared with placebo but no differences compared with senna. Although not explicitly stated, abdominal pain and diarrhea were adverse events, necessitating a dose reduction in 53.3% of subjects. None of the studies reported hypermagnesemia as a potential adverse event.

### Association of laxatives use with incident dementia and modifying effect of genetic susceptibility: a population-based cohort study with propensity score matching [^116HdxTW]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of dementia

All-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia were ascertained based on a self-reported diagnosis of dementia, hospital admission (hospital primary and secondary), and death records (death primary and contributory): dementia (Data-Field 42,018 and 42,019), Alzheimer's disease (Data-Field 42,020 and 42,021), and vascular dementia (Data-Field 42,022 and 42,023). Codes used in the UK Biobank study to identify dementia cases were shown in the Supplementary Table 1.

Assessment use of laxatives

Through a touchscreen questionnaire, we collected information on use of laxatives at baseline. Participants were asked "Do you regularly take any of the following? (Medication for pain relief, constipation, heartburn)". If they answered positively for "Laxatives (e.g. Dulcolax, Senokot)", they were defined as laxatives users. Besides, details about medication types were extracted from the UK Biobank, which was obtained through a verbal interview by a trained nurse on prescription medications. Short-term medications were not included. We searched all the classes of laxative drugs (Supplementary Table 2) and categories the laxatives into four varieties according to their effects on constipation, including softeners and emollients, bulk forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives. Furthermore, we explored the association between detail dosage of laxatives and the risk of incident dementia. Primary care data for about 230,000 UK Biobank participants was made available in 2019. This dataset contains coded prescribed medications (including prescription date, drug code and, where available, drug name and quantity). When considered the sufficient cases for laxative use and non-use groups, we extracted the three most commonly used laxative drugs through prescription medications, including senna, lactulose, and docusate. We divided the total dosage of each laxative into three groups according to the median: non-laxative use, low (less than the median), and high (more than the median).
