## Question

Automatic system dysfunction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about autonomic system dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and scope. Then, I should classify etiologies and map clinical manifestations by organ system. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including screening, bedside tests, and advanced autonomic testing. After that, I need to appraise the evidence base and assign a GRADE-like quality rating. Finally, I will outline management principles, highlight special populations, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. "Automatic system dysfunction" almost certainly refers to autonomic nervous system dysfunction, also called dysautonomia, which encompasses disorders of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems that regulate involuntary physiologic processes across multiple organ systems, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, sudomotor, and pupillomotor domains.

> I will now examine the etiologic classification, because treatment hinges on cause. Autonomic dysfunction can be intrinsic, arising from primary autonomic failure or neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and pure autonomic failure, or from peripheral neuropathies like diabetic autonomic neuropathy and amyloid polyneuropathy; it can also be extrinsic, secondary to systemic disease, trauma, infection, or toxic-metabolic insults, including diabetes, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and post-COVID syndromes [^b67c9756] [^134fd757] [^2423b284] [^778c544d] [^1d9fe1cf] [^12ec9d73] [^8f6c36c7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prevalence without anchoring to data. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in diabetes is common, with prevalence ranging from about 3–5% in early type 1 diabetes to 44–60% in long-standing type 2 diabetes, and it is frequently underrecognized despite its prognostic significance; similarly, autonomic symptoms are reported in up to 75% of ALS patients, though severe cardiovascular autonomic failure is less common and tends to occur in advanced disease [^743211b0] [^f6768dae].

> Next, I should review the clinical manifestations by organ system to build a coherent symptom map. Cardiovascular features include orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, postprandial hypotension, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and reduced heart rate variability; gastrointestinal features include gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, early satiety, and dysphagia; urogenital features include neurogenic bladder, erectile dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction; sudomotor features include anhidrosis, hyperhidrosis, and thermoregulatory dyscontrol; neuro-ophthalmic features include pupillary abnormalities and dry eyes; and systemic features include fatigue, exercise intolerance, and coat-hanger pain, with symptom clusters often reflecting the underlying pathophysiology and distribution of autonomic involvement [^d3be5447] [^87e370c4] [^0731b684] [^19012d49].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't overpromise on testing. Screening should start with a targeted history and physical, including orthostatic vital signs and a 10-minute stand test to capture heart rate and blood pressure responses, with attention to medication contributors and red flags such as early, severe dysautonomia suggesting MSA; bedside autonomic maneuvers include deep breathing, Valsalva, and active stand or head-up tilt to assess cardiovagal, adrenergic, and sudomotor function; advanced testing, when indicated, includes tilt-table testing, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing, thermoregulatory sweat testing, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and, in select cases, MIBG scintigraphy to distinguish PD from MSA, with composite scoring systems like CASS aiding severity grading and longitudinal monitoring [^edc4eab8] [^03f8cc19] [^6221a9f5] [^525d6279] [^7891ebf9].

> I need to ensure the evidence appraisal is transparent. The literature spans systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized and observational studies, and expert consensus; however, many autonomic testing studies are observational and heterogeneous, and high-quality RCTs for disease-modifying therapy are limited, particularly in synucleinopathies and post-COVID dysautonomia; nonetheless, the prognostic association of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction with mortality and disability is consistently reported across diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and TBI cohorts, supporting the clinical relevance of detection and management even if mechanistic links remain incompletely defined [^743211b0] [^f6768dae] [^602dcdf4].

> Let me consider management principles, and I should double-check that I separate nonpharmacologic from pharmacologic strategies. Nonpharmacologic care is foundational and includes patient education, liberalizing salt and fluids, using compression garments, elevating the head of bed, timed voiding, dietary modification, and graded exercise; pharmacologic therapy is tailored to the dominant phenotype, with droxidopa or midodrine for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, fludrocortisone or desmopressin in select cases, pyridostigmine for cardiovagal failure, and agents like metoclopramide, ondansetron, or prucalopride for gastroparesis, while addressing supine hypertension and medication-induced contributors; in diabetes, optimizing glycemic control remains central to slowing autonomic neuropathy progression [^c0f8722f] [^15025d47] [^d3be5447] [^e5ea4ed7].

> But wait, what if the presentation is post-COVID dysautonomia or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with POTS; I should confirm condition-specific nuances. In post-COVID cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, POTS and inappropriate sinus tachycardia are common, and management emphasizes volume expansion, salt loading, exercise conditioning, and, when needed, beta-blockers or ivabradine, with ambulatory monitoring to detect nocturnal hypertension; in hEDS/HSD, POTS is frequent and often coexists with GI dysmotility and mast cell activation, so a multidisciplinary approach with judicious MCAS testing and integrated GI, cardiology, and neurology care is recommended [^8f6c36c7] [^68a306ab] [^f76a70cf] [^4639399d].

> I should confirm special populations where autonomic dysfunction changes outcomes. In diabetes, CAN independently predicts cardiovascular mortality and is associated with silent ischemia and arrhythmias, arguing for annual screening in patients with other microvascular complications; in ALS, autonomic symptoms are common and correlate with worse progression and survival, underscoring the need to assess and manage dysautonomia proactively; in older adults, orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension frequently coexist and confer high risks of falls, cognitive decline, and mortality, requiring careful balancing of therapies and blood pressure targets [^743211b0] [^f6768dae] [^53eaf517].

> Hold on, I should verify the key knowledge gaps so we don't overstate certainties. We lack standardized, universally adopted diagnostic protocols across centers, with heterogeneity in equipment, normative data, and training; we need biomarkers to distinguish among synucleinopathies and to detect early autonomic failure; we have limited disease-modifying therapies, particularly for MSA and PD-related dysautonomia; and we require better longitudinal data on the natural history and treatment responsiveness of post-COVID dysautonomia and trauma-related autonomic dysfunction, including TBI and spinal cord injury [^525d6279] [^9d63500e] [^d4c3f71b] [^602dcdf4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear and actionable. Autonomic dysfunction is common, heterogeneous, and prognostically meaningful across multiple conditions; a structured approach anchored in history, bedside orthostatic testing, and selective use of autonomic laboratories enables accurate diagnosis and guides therapy; nonpharmacologic measures are first-line and pharmacologic choices should match the dominant phenotype; and early recognition with individualized, multidisciplinary care can mitigate symptoms, reduce complications, and improve quality of life, even as we continue to refine diagnostic standards and pursue disease-modifying strategies [^b67c9756] [^c0f8722f] [^15025d47].

Autonomic dysfunction, or dysautonomia, is a **disorder of the autonomic nervous system** that impairs regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, temperature, and other involuntary functions [^49abcfed]. It can be primary (e.g. multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, pure autonomic failure) [^b67c9756] or secondary to systemic diseases such as diabetes [^134fd757], amyloidosis [^2423b284], or autoimmune disorders [^8a47e377]. Common symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, syncope, gastroparesis, neurogenic bladder, and sudomotor abnormalities [^d3be5447]; diagnosis relies on clinical history, bedside orthostatic vitals, and autonomic testing (tilt, Valsalva, QSART) [^6221a9f5] [^525d6279]. Management is **multidisciplinary and symptom-targeted**, using nonpharmacologic measures (salt/fluid loading, compression, head-up sleeping) [^c0f8722f] and medications such as midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, and pyridostigmine [^15025d47]; prognosis varies by cause, with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in diabetes carrying high mortality risk [^743211b0] [^e5ea4ed7].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Autonomic dysfunction presents with **multisystem symptoms** [^b67c9756]; the most common include:

| **System** | **Common manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Orthostatic hypotension <br/> - Syncope <br/> - Supine hypertension <br/> - Exercise intolerance [^49abcfed] [^edc4eab8] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Gastroparesis <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Early satiety [^d3be5447] [^3ef513e9] |
| Urogenital | - Neurogenic bladder <br/> - Erectile dysfunction <br/> - Sexual dysfunction [^87e370c4] [^0731b684] |
| Sudomotor | - Anhidrosis <br/> - Hyperhidrosis <br/> - Thermoregulatory dysfunction [^87e370c4] [^0731b684] |
| Pupillomotor | - Pupillary abnormalities <br/> - Visual disturbances [^cc5a75ad] |

---

## Etiology and classification

Autonomic dysfunction is classified as **primary or secondary**:

- **Primary autonomic failure**: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) [^9d63500e], Parkinson's disease (PD) [^87e370c4], pure autonomic failure (PAF) [^d58f916d], and familial dysautonomia.
- **Secondary autonomic dysfunction**: Diabetes mellitus (diabetic autonomic neuropathy) [^134fd757], amyloidosis [^2423b284], autoimmune disorders (e.g. autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy) [^b67c9756], Guillain-Barré syndrome [^12ec9d73], multiple sclerosis [^778c544d], spinal cord injury [^1d9fe1cf], and traumatic brain injury [^602dcdf4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Detailed symptom review, medication history, and bedside orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements [^edc4eab8].
- **Autonomic function tests**: Head-up tilt table testing, Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing tests, and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) [^6221a9f5] [^525d6279].
- **Laboratory tests**: Blood glucose, HbA1c, autoimmune panels, and specific biomarkers (e.g. ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies) [^b67c9756].
- **Imaging**: Cardiac MRI or PET imaging may be used to assess cardiac sympathetic innervation in specific cases (e.g. Parkinson's disease) [^7891ebf9].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized and multidisciplinary**, combining nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies:

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic interventions include **increased salt and fluid intake** to expand plasma volume [^c0f8722f], compression garments to reduce venous pooling, and head-up tilt sleeping to mitigate supine hypertension [^c0f8722f]. Physical therapy and exercise programs improve orthostatic tolerance and overall function [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

- **Midodrine**: Alpha-agonist for orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].
- **Droxidopa**: Norepinephrine prodrug for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].
- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid for volume expansion [^notfound].
- **Pyridostigmine**: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for autonomic failure [^notfound].
- **Desmopressin**: For nocturnal polyuria and nocturia [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **underlying cause and severity**. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in diabetes is associated with increased mortality, arrhythmias, and silent myocardial ischemia [^743211b0] [^e5ea4ed7]. MSA has a poor prognosis with rapid progression and high mortality [^0731b684]. Chronic autonomic dysfunction can cause significant disability, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization [^15025d47].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies include **device-based neuromodulation** (e.g. baroreflex activation therapy) [^035df11f], gene therapy, and stem cell approaches for neurodegenerative forms [^0731b684]. Research focuses on developing biomarkers for early detection, personalized medicine, and disease-modifying therapies [^9d63500e].

---

Autonomic dysfunction is a **complex, multisystem disorder** requiring a structured diagnostic approach and individualized management. Early recognition and targeted therapy can improve symptoms, quality of life, and outcomes, though prognosis remains closely tied to the underlying cause and severity [^b67c9756].

## References

### A practical approach to peripheral autonomic neuropathies [^4782d946]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review focuses on the practical evaluation and management of patients with autonomic neuropathies.

Recent Findings

Autonomic neuropathies are complex disorders and result in diverse clinical manifestations that affect the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and sudomotor systems. The autonomic medical history is key when seeing a patient with suspected autonomic neuropathy. The history guides the clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and autonomic testing in patients with autonomic neuropathies. The treatment of autonomic neuropathies is based on the combination of disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic pharmacologic therapies, and nonpharmacological management. Response to treatment can be assessed with quantitative autonomic biomarkers.

Summary

Treatment of autonomic neuropathies should be individualized, guided by disease state, medications' mechanism of action and adverse event profile as well as cost. Genetic discoveries and pathologic understanding lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies as seen in familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

### Autonomic nervous system dysfunction: JACC focus seminar [^49abcfed]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autonomic nervous system control of the heart is a dynamic process in both health and disease. A multilevel neural network is responsible for control of chronotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy, and inotropy. Intrinsic autonomic dysfunction arises from diseases that directly affect the autonomic nerves, such as diabetes mellitus and the syndromes of primary autonomic failure. Extrinsic autonomic dysfunction reflects the changes in autonomic function that are secondarily induced by cardiac or other disease. An array of tests interrogate various aspects of cardiac autonomic control in either resting conditions or with physiological perturbations from resting conditions. The prognostic significance of these assessments have been well established. Clinical usefulness has not been established, and the precise mechanistic link to mortality is less well established. Further efforts are required to develop optimal approaches to delineate cardiac autonomic dysfunction and its adverse effects to develop tools that can be used to guide clinical decision-making.

### Autonomic manifestations of epilepsy: emerging pathways to sudden death? [^7d749fdf]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Epileptic networks are intimately connected with the autonomic nervous system, as exemplified by a plethora of ictal (during a seizure) autonomic manifestations, including epigastric sensations, palpitations, goosebumps and syncope (fainting). Ictal autonomic changes might serve as diagnostic clues, provide targets for seizure detection and help us to understand the mechanisms that underlie sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Autonomic alterations are generally more prominent in focal seizures originating from the temporal lobe, demonstrating the importance of limbic structures to the autonomic nervous system, and are particularly pronounced in focal-to-bilateral and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The presence, type and severity of autonomic features are determined by the seizure onset zone, propagation pathways, lateralization and timing of the seizures, and the presence of interictal autonomic dysfunction. Evidence is mounting that not all autonomic manifestations are linked to SUDEP. In addition, experimental and clinical data emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP and its infrequent overlap with sudden cardiac death. Here, we review the spectrum and diagnostic value of the mostly benign and self-limiting autonomic manifestations of epilepsy. In particular, we focus on presentations that are likely to contribute to SUDEP and discuss how wearable devices might help to prevent SUDEP.

### Cardiac autonomic innervation [^a1333f78]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system plays a key role in regulating changes in the cardiovascular system and its adaptation to various human body functions. The sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system is associated with the fight and flight response, while the parasympathetic division is responsible for the restorative effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Disorders involving these two divisions can lead to, and are seen as, a manifestation of most common cardiovascular disorders. Over the last few decades, extensive research has been performed establishing imaging techniques to quantify the autonomic dysfunction associated with various cardiovascular disorders. Additionally, several techniques have been tested with variable success in modulating the cardiac autonomic nervous system as treatment for these disorders. In this review, we summarize basic anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system including adrenergic receptors. We have also discussed several imaging modalities available to aid in diagnosis of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and autonomic modulation techniques, including pharmacologic and device-based therapies, that have been or are being tested currently.

### Autonomic nervous system disorders in multiple sclerosis [^778c544d]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which also affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Manifestations of MS in the ANS include urological, sexual, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and thermoregulatory disorders as well as increased fatigue. These problems are common yet are often underestimated due to the non-specificity of the symptoms and the limited evaluation of the ANS in the usual clinical practice. Most of these symptoms seem to be related to localized lesions in the CNS. However, the mechanisms by which these disorders are caused in MS have not been fully investigated, thus preventing any focused etiological treatment. The most common disorders of the ANS in MS represent a challenge for clinicians due to the variability of the clinical picture and our minimal data on their diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of individualized treatment regimens, often in need of multiple approaches, seem to yield the best results in managing ANS dysfunction in MS patients.

### Neuropathy: the crystal ball for cardiovascular disease? [^7a9c68f8]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Physiological activities of the cardiovascular system are under the control of the autonomic nervous system. Damage to the autonomic nerves that innervate the heart and blood vessels results in dysfunction in heart rate control and vascular dynamics (i.e. CAN). Autonomic imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems' regulation of cardiovascular function contributes to metabolic abnormalities and significant morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes. Clinical manifestations of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (e.g. exercise intolerance, intraoperative cardiovascular liability, orthostatic tachycardia and bradycardia syndromes, silent myocardial ischemia) can result in life-threatening outcomes. In fact, the ultimate outcome of increased risk of mortality is clearly associated with the presence of autonomic dysfunction. Results from the ACCORD trial again confirmed the association of CAN and mortality. These investigators showed that the individuals in this trial with baseline CAN were 1.55–2.14 times as likely to die as individuals without CAN. Furthermore, CAN in the presence of peripheral neuropathy was the highest predictor of CVD mortality (i.e. hazard ratio [HR] 2.95, P = 0.008). Indeed, combining indexes of autonomic dysfunction have been shown to be associated with the risk of mortality.

### The expanding universe of disorders of the basal ganglia [^843e18b4]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

The basal ganglia were originally thought to be associated purely with motor control. However, dysfunction and pathology of different regions and circuits are now known to give rise to many clinical manifestations beyond the association of basal ganglia dysfunction with movement disorders. Moreover, disorders that were thought to be caused by dysfunction of the basal ganglia only, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, have diverse abnormalities distributed not only in the brain but also in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems; this knowledge poses new questions and challenges. We discuss advances and the unanswered questions, and ways in which progress might be made.

### The clinical approach to autonomic failure in neurological disorders [^b67c9756]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Central or peripheral neurological disorders can manifest with autonomic failure or autonomic hyperactivity, which may affect the sympathetic, parasympathetic and/or enteric nervous systems. Disorders causing autonomic failure can be classified according to the presence or absence of associated neurological manifestations, such as peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonism, and their temporal profile (acute or subacute, chronic progressive, static, or episodic). A systematic approach allows focused evaluation to detect treatable, potentially disabling or life-threatening conditions. Subacute isolated autonomic failure affecting sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous system function, in various combinations, occurs in autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, which might be the first manifestation of an underlying neoplasm. Autonomic failure can be an important feature of several types of peripheral neuropathy, including sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies, sensory ganglionopathy, and distal painful peripheral neuropathies. Progressive autonomic failure occurs in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disorders. Autonomic failure may also occur in hereditary leukoencephalopathies or prion disorders. This Review outlines the clinical approach to patients with generalized autonomic failure, focusing predominantly on classification and diagnosis, but also touching briefly on treatment and management.

### Autonomic dysfunction in movement disorders [^ea6a1fb1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is an under-recognised but important aspect of the aetiological and clinical manifestation of primary degenerative dysautonomias such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the clinical presentation of dysautonomia in these two disorders may overlap, yet pathological and in vivo imaging studies suggest considerable differences. Functional imaging studies suggest that selective cardiac sympathetic denervation may occur early in PD but not in other parkinsonian syndromes. The clinical implication of this apparently disease specific peripheral dysautonomia is unknown and would be the subject of much interest in future years. Dysautonomia in degenerative disorders also affect respiration, genitourinary function and sleep. Sleep related disorders such as rapid eye movement behaviour disorder and urinary voiding dysfunction appear to precede the development of PD related symptoms while patients with sporadic ataxia have been shown to progress to develop MSA. Dysautonomia has also been recognised in other movement disorders, examples being the combination of dystonia and complex regional pain syndrome with elevated HLA-DR13 and late onset Huntington's disease presenting with dominant parkinsonism and minimal chorea. These studies have helped progress in various diagnostic and management parameters in relation to autonomic dysfunction and movement disorders.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on testing for autonomic and somatic nerve dysfunction [^30bc1287]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

This document represents the official position of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology. Where there were no randomized controlled trials or specific U.S. FDA labeling for issues in clinical practice, the participating clinical experts utilized their judgment and experience. Every effort was made to achieve consensus among the committee members. Position statements are meant to provide guidance, but they are not to be considered prescriptive for any individual patient and cannot replace the judgment of a clinician.

### Multiple sclerosis and the autonomic nervous system [^e1a8a3ee]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Symptoms related to alterations of the autonomic nervous system are frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Bladder or bowel dysfunction or impairment of sexual performance is highly distressing for most MS patients, whereas the clinical relevance of other autonomic symptoms is less clear. Cardiovascular autonomic alterations might relate to clinical signs such as orthostatic intolerance; a relationship with fatigue is uncertain. However, the frequency of abnormal findings in tests for the cardiovascular autonomic system varies due to the lack of standardized test performance or differentially used cut-off values. The incidence of additional symptoms such as pupillomotor or sweating alterations and especially their relationship to overall autonomic nervous system abnormalities is not well known. Although their impact on daily life is low, they can at least serve as diagnostic tools. Beside these clinical aspects, alterations of the autonomic nervous system have also been reported to alter immunological cascades in experimental conditions. However, corresponding results have not been confirmed in clinical trials yet.

### Autonomic dysfunctions in idiopathic Parkinson's disease [^5e120291]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with Parkinson's disease experience autonomic dysfunction at some point in the course of their disease. In contrast to autonomic dysregulation in multisystem atrophy, they are less severe, and they frequently cause troublesome symptoms only in advanced stages of the disease. The quality of life is nevertheless substantially restricted. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and urogenital autonomic dysfunction is predominant. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can greatly benefit the patient. An interdisciplinary approach is desirable in most cases.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in post-COVID-19 syndrome: a major health-care burden [^8f6c36c7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (CVAD) is a malfunction of the cardiovascular system caused by deranged autonomic control of circulatory homeostasis. CVAD is an important component of post-COVID-19 syndrome, also termed long COVID, and might affect one-third of highly symptomatic patients with COVID-19. The effects of CVAD can be seen at both the whole-body level, with impairment of heart rate and blood pressure control, and in specific body regions, typically manifesting as microvascular dysfunction. Many severely affected patients with long COVID meet the diagnostic criteria for two common presentations of CVAD: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. CVAD can also manifest as disorders associated with hypotension, such as orthostatic or postprandial hypotension, and recurrent reflex syncope. Advances in research, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have identified new potential pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods and therapeutic targets in CVAD. For clinicians who daily see patients with CVAD, knowledge of its symptomatology, detection and appropriate management is more important than ever. In this Review, we define CVAD and its major forms that are encountered in post-COVID-19 syndrome, describe possible CVAD aetiologies, and discuss how CVAD, as a component of post-COVID-19 syndrome, can be diagnosed and managed. Moreover, we outline directions for future research to discover more efficient ways to cope with this prevalent and long-lasting condition.

### Autonomic dysfunction in autoimmune rheumatic disease [^8a47e377]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular and neurological manifestations are known to occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD), often in subclinical form. The term autonomic nervous system (ANS) describes nerves that are concerned predominantly with the regulation of bodily functions. It is comprised of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and their function is complementary. ANS involvement has rarely been studied in patients with ARD, and studies have shown conflicting results. This may be because symptoms of autonomic dysfunction are nonspecific and extremely varied, and may pertain to several systems like the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and nervous. Moreover, tests to detect autonomic dysfunction are not routinely employed in clinical rheumatological practice. Another difficulty is to differentiate cardiovascular effects of drugs from ARD involvement. Previous studies on this topic found signs of parasympathetic and sympathetic dysfunction in variable proportions in patients with autoimmune diseases, between 24% and 100% in various tests depending on the methods used. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is the most common type of ANS dysfunction, and was revealed in the majority of ARD patients.

### Autonomic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: tools for assessment and review of the literature [^9c797d3f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is very common in patients with dementia, and its presence might also help in differential diagnosis among dementia subtypes. Various central nervous system structures affected in Alzheimer's disease are also implicated in autonomic nervous system regulation, and it has been hypothesized that the deficit in central cholinergic function observed in Alzheimer's disease could likely lead to autonomic dysfunction. Several feasible tests can be used in clinical practice for the assessment of parasympathetic and sympathetic functions, especially in terms of cardiovascular autonomic modulation. In this review, we describe the different tests available and the evidence from the literature which indicate a definite presence of autonomic dysfunction in dementia at various degrees. Importantly, the recognition of dysautonomia, besides possibly being an early marker of dementia, would help prevent the disabling complications which increase the risk of morbidity, institutionalization, and mortality in these individuals.

### Autonomic impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^7b89a9c5]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of motor neurones, but it is increasingly recognized to be a more disseminated disease. The autonomic nervous system may also be involved. Here we review the literature with specific emphasis on autonomic functions in ALS.

Recent Studies

Ample evidence exists for subclinical dysfunction of cardiovascular, sudomotor, gastrointestinal, salivary and lacrimal regulation, even in early ALS cases. Autonomic disturbances may lead to circulatory collapse or sudden death in respirator dependent patients. Several studies suggest the existence of sympathetic hyperactivity in ALS. We discuss some possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the subtle abnormalities and some clinical and treatment implications.

Summary

The wide range of autonomic involvement, together with results suggesting cognitive and extrapyramidal dysfunction, supports the view that ALS is a multisystem degenerative disease.

### Autonomic dysfunction in parkinsonian disorders: assessment and pathophysiology [^f71ea781]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor dysfunction (parkinsonism) and several non-motor features. Dysautonomia is a significant non-motor feature as well as a neuropsychiatric symptom. Autonomic dysfunction can occur even in the early stages of PD, often preceding the onset of the classic motor symptoms of PD. The patterns of autonomic features in PD are different from other parkinsonian disorders. Detection of autonomic dysfunction may therefore be helpful in diagnosing PD in the early or pre-motor stages, and/or in differentiating it from other parkinsonian disorders, such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supuranuclear palsy. The aim of this review is to describe aspects of autonomic dysfunction, including symptoms, assessment and pathophysiology, resulting from autonomic impairment in PD and other parkinsonian syndromes.

### Autonomic dysfunction after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: symptom spectrum and clinical testing outcomes [^602dcdf4]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

We present evidence for clinically relevant, subjective and objective, autonomic dysfunction after msTBI. We hope these findings increases awareness of autonomic dysfunction after TBI, and promote more diagnostic engagement. Future work should further characterise the nature of post-TBI autonomic dysfunction, investigate how TBI causes these problems, and the links between autonomic dysfunction and other post-TBI sequelae.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^912dc3b8]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Autonomic neuropathies in diabetes — definition and evaluation — are described as affecting autonomic neurons and presenting with condition-specific syndromes and signs that should be evaluated during the medical history and physical examination of all individuals with diabetes mellitus, with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) highlighted as the most studied and clinically relevant diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

### Post-COVID dysautonomias: what we know and (mainly) what we don't know [^d4c3f71b]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Following on from the COVID-19 pandemic is another worldwide public health challenge that is referred to variously as long COVID, post-COVID syndrome or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). PASC comes in many forms and affects all body organs. This heterogeneous presentation suggests involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which has numerous roles in the maintenance of homeostasis and coordination of responses to various stressors. Thus far, studies of ANS dysregulation in people with PASC have been largely observational and descriptive, based on symptom inventories or objective but indirect measures of cardiovascular function, and have paid little attention to the adrenomedullary, hormonal and enteric nervous components of the ANS. Such investigations do not consider the syndromic nature of autonomic dysfunction. This Review provides an update on the literature relating to ANS abnormalities in people with post-COVID syndrome and presents a theoretical perspective on how the ANS might participate in common features of PASC.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^f11af061]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission that is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems such as the bowel and the bladder. In the present review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Evaluation of the autonomic nervous system [^6221a9f5]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

This article has reviewed the laboratory evaluation of autonomic disorders. Autonomic testing can be divided into the assessment of three functional domains: sudomotor (assessed best by the thermoregulatory sweat test or QSART), cardiovagal (assessed by the Valsalva ratio and heart rate response to deep breathing or standing up), and adrenergic (assessed by the blood pressure response to the Valsalva maneuver or head-upright tilt). Tables 2 and 3 summarize the test findings in a variety of clinical disorders affecting autonomic nervous system function.

### Multiple system atrophy: an update and emerging directions of biomarkers and clinical trials [^9d63500e]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple system atrophy is a rare, debilitating, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that manifests clinically as a diverse combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. It is pathologically characterized by oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions containing abnormally aggregated α-synuclein. According to the updated Movement Disorder Society diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy, the diagnosis of clinically established multiple system atrophy requires the manifestation of autonomic dysfunction in combination with poorly levo-dopa responsive parkinsonism and/or cerebellar syndrome. Although symptomatic management of multiple system atrophy can substantially improve quality of life, therapeutic benefits are often limited, ephemeral, and they fail to modify the disease progression and eradicate underlying causes. Consequently, effective breakthrough treatments that target the causes of disease are needed. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies are currently focusing on a set of hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases to slow or halt the progression of multiple system atrophy: pathological protein aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, aberrant proteostasis, neuronal inflammation, and neuronal cell death. Meanwhile, specific biomarkers and measurements with higher specificity and sensitivity are being developed for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, particularly for early detection of the disease. More intriguingly, a growing number of new disease-modifying candidates, which can be used to design multi-targeted, personalized treatment in patients, are being investigated, notwithstanding the failure of most previous attempts.

Diabetic neuropathies are the most common type of neuropathies seen in clinical practice. These neuropathies can range clinically from asymptomatic to manifesting symptoms caused by motor, sensory, and autonomic nerve dysfunction. These neuropathies can affect the peripheral nervous system, pain receptors, cardiovascular, urogenital, and gastrointestinal systems. This monograph presents an overview of the different types of diabetic neuropathies, their presentations, diagnostic tools, and strategies for management.

### Dysautonomias: clinical disorders of the autonomic nervous system [^7236f96b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after "patchy" autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.

### Autonomic nervous system and disorders of gut-brain interaction: pathology, assessment, and treatment considerations for pediatric gastrointestinal health specialists [^4360e6d9]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The autonomic nervous system and the gastrointestinal (GI) system share a bidirectional relationship. Clinically, disruptions to either of these systems mutually influence the onset and persistence of symptoms modulated by the other system. The impact of autonomic dysfunction on GI health is especially relevant in the care of pediatric disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) as these patients commonly report a diverse range of symptoms both within and outside the GI tract. Therefore, it is essential to include the role of autonomic function in the assessment and treatment of pediatric patients with DGBI.

### Autonomic function testing: an important diagnostic test for patients with syncope [^109b15bd]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem with a large differential diagnosis. The initial history and physical examination often provide initial clues; however, some cases warrant further testing to determine the underlying cause. Autonomic function testing is a safe way to evaluate patients with syncope further, and to assess their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Autonomic testing can help to diagnose several conditions, including orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome and neutrally mediated syncope. Thus, when the cause of syncope is unclear, autonomic testing can help to assess the autonomic nervous system, stratify the risk of future episodes and to guide treatment decisions.

### The autonomic nervous system and heart failure [^3cfd4f99]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) is characterized by hemodynamic abnormalities that result in neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. Alterations in receptor activation from this autonomic imbalance may have profound effects on cardiac function and structure. Inhibition of the sympathetic drive to the heart through β-receptor blockade has become a standard component of therapy for HF with a dilated left ventricle because of its effectiveness in inhibiting the ventricular structural remodeling process and in prolonging life. Several devices for selective modulation of sympathetic and vagal activity have recently been developed in an attempt to alter the natural history of HF. The optimal counteraction of the excessive sympathetic activity is still unclear. A profound decrease in adrenergic support with excessive blockade of the sympathetic nervous system may result in adverse outcomes in clinical HF. In this review, we analyze the data supporting a contributory role of the autonomic functional alterations on the course of HF, the techniques used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, the evidence for clinical effectiveness of pharmacological and device interventions, and the potential future role of autonomic nervous system modifiers in the management of this syndrome.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: a joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European federation of autonomic societies: a joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European federation of autonomic societies [^b6631480]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions estimated to affect 70 million people worldwide. The cardiovascular ANS is the most frequently affected domain, with an incidence of a first‐in‐life syncope episode of 6.2 per 1000 person‐years. In contrast to other neurological disciplines, the evaluation of the ANS is associated with special caveats. Since on most occasions the ANS cannot be tested directly, its assessment relies on examining noninvasive physiological variables that express not only the activity of the autonomic reflex arch, but also the function of the effector organ and interaction of the body with external physical stimuli. The evaluation is extensive and time consuming and test batteries typically include the head‐up tilt test, the Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing for the evaluation of sympathetic adrenergic and cardiovagal function, and the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), thermoregulatory sweat test, sympathetic skin response, and electrochemical skin conductance measurement for the evaluation of sudomotor function.

### The autonomic nervous system and hypertension [^62a919ec]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Physiological studies have long documented the key role played by the autonomic nervous system in modulating cardiovascular functions and in controlling blood pressure values, both at rest and in response to environmental stimuli. Experimental and clinical investigations have tested the hypothesis that the origin, progression, and outcome of human hypertension are related to dysfunctional autonomic cardiovascular control and especially to abnormal activation of the sympathetic division. Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension. Finally, we examine the modifications of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular influences induced by current nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting elevations in blood pressure and restoring the normotensive state.

### Early autonomic and cognitive dysfunction in PD, DLB and MSA: blurring the boundaries between α-synucleinopathies [^c08080ba]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy can be difficult, especially because in early phase they might present with overlapping clinical features. Notably, orthostatic hypotension and cognitive dysfunction are common nonmotor aspects of parkinsonian syndromes and can be both present from the earliest stages of all α-synucleinopathies, indicating a common neurobiological basis in their strong relationship. In view of the increasing awareness about the prevalence of mild cognitive dysfunction in multiple system atrophy, the relevance of autonomic dysfunction in demented parkinsonian patients, the critical role of non-motor symptoms in clustering Parkinson's disease patients and the shift to studying patients in the prodromal phase, we will discuss some intrinsic limitations of current clinical diagnostic criteria, even when applied by movement disorder specialists. In particular, we will focus on the early coexistence of autonomic and cognitive dysfunction in the setting of overt or latent parkinsonism as pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of α-synucleinopathies. As early and accurate diagnosis remains of outmost importance for counselling of patients and timely enrolment into disease-modifying clinical trials, a continuous effort of research community is ongoing to further improve the clinical diagnostic accuracy of α-synucleinopathies.

### The nature of the autonomic dysfunction in multiple system atrophy [^035df11f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2002). Low credibility.

The concept that multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system is several decades old. While there has been renewed interest in the movement disorder associated with MSA, two recent consensus statements confirm the centrality of the autonomic disorder to the diagnosis. Here, we reexamine the autonomic pathophysiology in MSA. Whereas MSA is often thought of as "autonomic failure", new evidence indicates substantial persistence of functioning sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves even in clinically advanced disease. These findings help explain some of the previously poorly understood features of MSA. Recognition that MSA entails persistent, constitutive autonomic tone requires a significant revision of our concepts of its diagnosis and therapy. We will review recent evidence bearing on autonomic tone in MSA and discuss their therapeutic implications, particularly in terms of the possible development of a bionic baroreflex for better control of blood pressure.

### Metabolic syndrome: a sympathetic disease? [^2a44103a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Metabolic syndrome is associated with adverse health outcomes and is a growing problem worldwide. Although efforts to harmonise the definition of metabolic syndrome have helped to better understand the prevalence and the adverse outcomes associated with the disorder on a global scale, the mechanisms underpinning the metabolic changes that define it are incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence from laboratory and human studies suggests that activation of the sympathetic nervous system has an important role in metabolic syndrome. Indeed, treatment strategies commonly recommended for patients with metabolic syndrome, such as diet and exercise to induce weight loss, are associated with sympathetic inhibition. Pharmacological and device-based approaches to target activation of the sympathetic nervous system directly are available and have provided evidence to support the important part played by sympathetic regulation, particularly for blood pressure and glucose control. Preliminary evidence is encouraging, but whether therapeutically targeting sympathetic overactivity could help to prevent metabolic syndrome and attenuate its adverse outcomes remains to be determined.

### Neuropathology of autonomic dysfunction in synucleinopathies [^3512c7e9]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The synucleinopathies-Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure-result from distinct patterns of abnormal α-synuclein aggregation throughout the nervous system. Autonomic dysfunction in these disorders results from variable involvement of the central and peripheral autonomic networks. The major pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites; of multiple system atrophy, oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions; and of pure autonomic failure, peripheral neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Clinical manifestations include orthostatic hypotension, thermoregulatory dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and urogenital dysfunction with neurogenic bladder and sexual dysfunction. Strong evidence supports isolated idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep disorder as a significant risk factor for the eventual development of synucleinopathies with autonomic and/or motor involvement. In contrast, some neurologically normal elderly individuals have Lewy-related pathology. Future work may reveal protective or vulnerability factors that allow some patients to harbor Lewy pathology without overt autonomic dysfunction. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Unveiling the role of cerebellar alterations in the autonomic nervous system: a systematic review of autonomic dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxias [^de60d90d]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this systematic review was to investigate the presence of autonomic deficits in patients with diverse genetic subtypes of SCA, aiming to further elucidate the role of the cerebellum within the ANS and to identify potential deficits currently underexplored in clinical practice. The results enabled us to characterize the peculiar autonomic disturbances of each SCA subtype while also assessing preliminary findings for less commonly investigated SCAs. However, despite the abundance of findings available, not all studies investigated the whole body of autonomic dysfunctions, with many focusing on the investigation of specific deficits. As a result, the estimated prevalences provided in this review may be more reliable for certain autonomic dysfunctions, drawing from the results of numerous studies, while others are less reliable. Subsequently, the results obtained for different genetic subtypes will be discussed, followed by a comparison between different SCAs to explore the potential involvement of the cerebellum in determining the observed autonomic deficits.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder? [^79b1705f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.

### Autonomic dysfunction among adult Survivors of childhood cancer [^fe30be2a]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiation- and chemotherapy-associated neuropathy, including autonomic dysfunction, has been recognized since the mid-1960s. The cumulative effects of chemotherapy and radiation-induced cardiovascular aging and autonomic dysfunction can be debilitating and are associated with increased all-cause mortality among cancer survivors. Moving beyond the initial diagnosis and traditional therapies for autonomic dysfunction, which have heavily relied on extrapolation from other disease states (diabetes mellitus, multisystem atrophy, and Parkinson's disease), there is a current focus on the development of standardized diagnostic criteria, testing, scoring systems, and treatments individualized to patients with cancer.

Autonomic dysfunction in patients with cancer can be the result of multiple etiologies, including the cancer itself (direct invasion of autonomic nerves, paraneoplastic syndromes), cancer therapies (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery), medications (opioids, antihypertensives), chronic pain/stress/insomnia, malnutrition/cachexia, or obesity/inactivity, as well as metabolic, electrolyte, and volume imbalances (Figure 1). These etiologies frequently overlap, making autonomic dysfunction a challenging condition to treat. Furthermore, the timing of when autonomic dysfunction manifests in patients with cancer or cancer survivors can vary widely, and present at variable timepoints after cancer diagnosis and treatment.

### Autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^87e370c4]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognition of the importance of nonmotor dysfunction as a component of Parkinson's disease has exploded over the past three decades. Autonomic dysfunction is a frequent and particularly important nonmotor feature because of the broad clinical spectrum it covers. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual, and thermoregulatory abnormalities all can appear in the setting of Parkinson's disease. Cardiovascular dysfunction is characterized most prominently by orthostatic hypotension. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can involve virtually all levels of the gastrointestinal tract. Urinary dysfunction can entail either too frequent voiding or difficulty voiding. Sexual dysfunction is frequent and frustrating for both patient and partner. Alterations in sweating and body temperature are not widely recognized but often are present. Autonomic dysfunction can significantly and deleteriously impact quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Because effective treatment for many aspects of autonomic dysfunction is available, it is vitally important that assessment of autonomic dysfunction be a regular component of the neurologic history and exam and that appropriate treatment be initiated and maintained.

### Treatment of autonomic dysfunction in parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies [^15025d47]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system afflicts most patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure, reducing quality of life and increasing mortality. For example, gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to impaired drug pharmacodynamics causing a worsening in motor symptoms, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can cause syncope, falls, and fractures. When recognized, autonomic problems can be treated, sometimes successfully. Discontinuation of potentially causative/aggravating drugs, patient education, and nonpharmacological approaches are useful and should be tried first. Pathophysiology-based pharmacological treatments that have shown efficacy in controlled trials of patients with synucleinopathies have been approved in many countries and are key to an effective management. Here, we review the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies, summarize the nonpharmacological and current pharmacological therapeutic strategies including recently approved drugs, and provide practical advice and management algorithms for clinicians, with focus on neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, dysphagia, sialorrhea, gastroparesis, constipation, neurogenic overactive bladder, underactive bladder, and sexual dysfunction. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Proper performance of autonomic function testing [^69564bb5]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this position statement is to provide a recommendation from experts at the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) on the proper performance of autonomic testing.

Methods

The AANEM Professional Practice Committee and selected AANEM members reached a consensus based on expert opinion on the training required to perform autonomic testing and the appropriate performance of such tests.

Results

Individuals without sufficient medical education in autonomic disorders are unqualified to interpret the data generated or to coordinate the findings with other clinical information in order to reach a clinical diagnosis.

Conclusions

The AANEM strongly recommends that autonomic testing procedures be performed by physicians with comprehensive knowledge of neurologic and autonomic disorders to ensure precise interpretation and diagnosis at the completion of the testing. The same physician should obtain a relevant history and physical examination and should directly supervise and interpret the data on-site and in real time. Muscle Nerve 55: 3–4, 2017.

### Autonomic dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease [^02510959]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

In addition to their more studied cognitive and motor effects, neurodegenerative diseases are also associated with impairments in autonomic function - the regulation of involuntary physiological processes. These autonomic impairments manifest in different ways and at different stages depending on the specific disease. The neural networks responsible for autonomic regulation in the brain and body have characteristics that render them particularly susceptible to the prion-like spread of protein aggregation involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the axons of these neurons - in both peripheral and central networks - are long and poorly myelinated axons, which make them preferential targets for pathological protein aggregation. Moreover, cortical regions integrating information about the internal state of the body are highly connected with other brain regions, which increases the likelihood of intersection with pathological pathways and prion-like spread of abnormal proteins. This leads to an autonomic 'signature' of dysfunction, characteristic of each neurodegenerative disease, that is linked to the affected networks and regions undergoing pathological aggregation.

### Comparison of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, autonomic dysfunction, and controls [^f76a70cf]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction (AD) refers to a range of conditions that impair the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, leading to clinical manifestations such as orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal motility disorders. AD can arise from primary disorders of the autonomic nervous system or as a secondary response to systemic diseases. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of AD and characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate upon standing, often accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. POTS results from a failure to adequately maintain vascular tone, causing blood pooling in the lower extremities and may contribute to blood pressure (BP) fluctuations.

The American Autonomic Society and European Federation of Autonomic Societies recommend ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate nocturnal hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, particularly those suspected of having neurogenic supine hypertension and those undergoing treatment with anti-hypotensive agents. However, there are currently no established guidelines advocating for, or against, the use of ABPM in patients diagnosed with POTS. The clinical role and potential utility of ABPM in this population remain undefined and warrants further investigation.

### Dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease: neurocardiological abnormalities [^4ba8d271]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of abnormal autonomic-nervous-system function occur commonly in Parkinson's disease (PD). Orthostatic hypotension in patients with parkinsonism has been thought to be a side-effect of treatment with levodopa, a late stage in the disease progression, or, if prominent and early with respect to disordered movement, an indication of a different disease, such as multiple system atrophy. Instead, patients with PD and orthostatic hypotension have clear evidence for baroreflex failure and loss of sympathetic innervation, most noticeably in the heart. By contrast, patients with multiple system atrophy, which is difficult to distinguish clinically from PD, have intact cardiac sympathetic innervation. Post-mortem studies confirm this distinction. Because PD involves postganglionic sympathetic noradrenergic lesions, the disease seems to be not only a movement disorder with dopamine loss in the nigrostriatal system of the brain, but also a dysautonomia, with norepinephrine loss in the sympathetic nervous system of the heart.

### Treatment of dysautonomia in extrapyramidal disorders [^9f7b07f8]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Although extrapyramidal diseases are commonly thought to solely affect the (extrapyramidal) motor system, non-motor symptoms such as behavioural abnormalities, dysautonomia, sleep disturbances and sensory dysfunctions are also frequently observed. Autonomic dysfunction is an important clinical component of extrapyramidal disease, but it is often not formally assessed, and thus frequently misdiagnosed. Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction can impact more on quality of life than motor symptoms. Appropriate symptom-oriented diagnosis and symptomatic treatment as part of an interdisciplinary approach can greatly benefit the patient. This review elaborates a limited overview on the treatment of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital and sudomotor autonomic dysfunction in various extrapyramidal syndromes.

### Multiple system atrophy: an update and emerging directions of biomarkers and clinical trials [^19012d49]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentations

MSA is characterized by various combinations of autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism, and ataxia, with the predominance of core motor symptoms defining MSA-P or MSA-C, although the symptoms of MSA-P and MSA-C often overlap. Many patients have a mixed phenotype.

According to the current diagnostic criteria, prominent autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia) is a critical defining feature in clinically established and probable MSA, with urogenital and cardiovascular systems primarily being affected and presenting in a variety of ways. Early and severe dysautonomia is indicative of a more aggressive disease course. Core clinical features include neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) and significant urinary dysfunction, such as voiding difficulty with retention after urination and urinary urge incontinence. Bladder dysfunction may be a prominent and common early symptom of MSA. Neurogenic OH for clinical established MSA is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mmHg or a drop in diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing or head up tilt (HUT). In addition to recurrent syncope, other characteristic symptoms of OH include dizziness, nausea, weakness, tremors, headache, and painful sensations in the neck known as coat-hanger pain.

### Quantitative studies of autonomic function [^66299b1f]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the peripheral and central autonomic nervous system is common in many neurological and general medical diseases. The quantitative assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic function is essential to confirm the diagnosis of autonomic failure, to provide the basis for follow-up examinations, and potentially to monitor successful treatment. Various procedures have been described as useful tools to quantify autonomic dysfunction. The most important tests evaluate cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic function. In this review, we therefore focus on standard tests of cardiovascular and sudomotor function such as heart-rate variability at rest and during deep breathing, active standing, and the Valsalva maneuver, and on the sympathetic skin response. These tests are widely used for routine clinical evaluation in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Refined methods of studying heart-rate variability, baroreflex testing, and detailed measures of sweat output are mostly used for research purposes. In this context, we describe the spectral analysis of slow modulation of heart rate or blood pressure, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, and consider various approaches to baroreflex testing, the thermoregulatory sweat test, and the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test. Finally, we discuss microneurography as a technique of direct recording of muscle sympathetic nerve activity.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the regulation of many physiologic processes, mediated by supraspinal control from centers in the central nervous system. The role of autonomic dysfunction in persons with spinal cord injuries is crucial to understand because many aspects of the altered physiology seen in these individuals are directly caused by ANS dysregulation.

### Autonomic dysfunction after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: symptom spectrum and clinical testing outcomes [^f8beb56a]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) is known to cause high rates of chronic neurologic, cognitive and behavioural sequelae. What is less appreciated is that TBI survivors often also report long-lasting systemic symptoms, many of which are suggestive of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Indeed, changes in heart rate (HR) variability, an experimental measure of cardiovascular ANS function, has been found in a number of studies of concussion and mild TBI, with one study reporting a positive correlation between TBI severity and degree of both sympathetic and parasympathetic impairment.

Orthostatic symptoms, presyncopal and syncopal episodes are those most likely to be recognised as being autonomically-mediated. However, ANS dysfunction can manifest in myriad additional symptoms that can negatively impact daily function and quality of life, such as abnormal sweating, nausea and bloating, constipation and diarrhoea, dry eyes and mouth, changes in skin colour and thermodysregulation, erectile dysfunction, visual blurring and photosensitivity. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 (COMPASS-31) tool is a simple-to-administer questionnaire which quantitatively assesses the symptomatic burden of autonomic dysfunction. Clinical autonomic function tests non-invasively assess the integrity of the ANS across multiple modalities, including cardiovagal, sudomotor and adrenergic function, and have shown utility in characterising and tracking ANS dysfunction

Autonomic dysfunction in the acute phase of severe TBI is well described in the syndrome of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity. However, beyond one or two case studies, no study has investigated clinically relevant autonomic dysfunction in the postacute period after TBI. We present the results of a clinical investigation in two groups of patients with msTBI. First, we collected quantitative symptom assessments in a cohort prospectively identified from a national TBI clinic. Second, we present clinical autonomic function testing results from a case series of patients retrospectively identified from a national referral Autonomic centre. We hypothesise that patients in the post-acute period of msTBI (1) experience a high burden of clinical autonomic symptoms, which (2) is associated with other health measures and (3) have objectively measurable sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction.

The degree of certainty required is that the source is the "suspected" or possible origin of the positive blood culture. Therefore in Dialysis Event CDA, the imputability observation is always set to "possible" to reflect that the positive blood culture is only being attributed to a suspected source. Values other than "possible" listed in the CDA imputability value set are used for other types of NHSN reporting and can be ignored for the implementation of Dialysis Event CDA.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^737a6676]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Autonomic evaluation in syncope — recommendation and context: Referral for autonomic evaluation can be useful to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in selected patients with syncope and known or suspected neurodegenerative disease (IIa, C-LD). Syncope due to neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) is common in patients with central or peripheral autonomic nervous system damage or dysfunction, and confirmation of specific neurogenic OH conditions causing syncope often requires additional autonomic evaluation.

### Autonomic dysfunction in progressive supranuclear palsy [^cc5a75ad]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The degree of involvement of the autonomic nervous system in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) has been investigated in several studies, often providing conflicting results. There is a need for a better characterization of autonomic dysfunction in PSP, to enhance our understanding of this highly disabling neurodegenerative disease including patients' needs and possibly be of value for clinicians in the differential diagnosis among Parkinsonian syndromes.

Methods

We applied a systematic methodology to review existing literature on Pubmed regarding autonomic nervous system involvement in PSP.

Results

PSP reported quite frequently symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction in all domains. Cardiovascular autonomic testing showed in some cases a certain degree of impairment (never severe). There was some evidence suggesting bladder dysfunction particularly in the storage phase. Dysphagia and constipation were the most common gastrointestinal symptoms. Instrumental tests seemed to confirm sudomotor and pupillomotor disturbances.

Conclusions

PSP patients frequently reported visceral symptoms, however objective testing showed that not always these reflected actual autonomic impairment. Further studies are needed to better delineate autonomic profile and its prognostic role in PSP.

### Orthostatic hypotension: management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^c0f8722f]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked, disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. We propose a novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH; review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH; discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage; provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision making and patient care; identify current gaps in knowledge and try to define future research directions. Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented highlighting various presentations of OH to provide a practical guide to evaluate and manage patients who have OH.

### Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in diabetes: a clinical perspective [^e5ea4ed7]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

CAN is a serious chronic complication of diabetes and an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality. As illustrated by the case vignette and by the evidence presented in this review, CAN is associated with a poor prognosis and poor quality of life. Conclusive clinical evidence from randomized prospective trials supports a central role for hyperglycemia in the pathogenesis of CAN, although other metabolic and vascular factors contribute to the disease state. The clinical presentation of CAN comprises a broad constellation of symptoms and deficits. Assessment of HRV is an easily available tool to document the presence of CAN. Cardiac scintigraphic imaging with sympathetic analogs offers more sensitive diagnostic alternatives for research use. The treatment of CAN is challenging. Recent clinical evidence continues to prove the benefits of glycemic control, while the benefits of lifestyle interventions are emerging.

### Dysautonomia and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^dcf84ade]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Nonmotor symptoms have recently become a focus of renewed clinical interest and research in Parkinson's disease (PD). Autonomic and cognitive dysfunction are among the most prevalent of these nonmotor aspects of the disease. Although exact clinico-pathological correlations have not been established, alpha-synuclein pathology with Lewy body formation in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as in neocortical areas are generally believed to be driving factors for autonomic failure and cognitive decline in PD. Recent pathological and clinical studies have suggested greater prevalence of clinical dysautonomia and cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies as compared with PD without dementia. This raises the possibility that spread of synuclein pathology to involve neocortical areas producing cognitive decline could be somehow linked to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PD.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^088a4da6]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance — pathophysiology and symptoms — are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

### Autonomic dysfunction in multiple sclerosis [^dfa841b0]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent chronic neurological disease affecting young persons in developed countries. MS is, however, considered as a secondary cause, of central origin, for autonomic dysfunction. The most common autonomic symptoms in MS are disorders of micturation, impotence, sudomotor and gastrointestinal disturbances, orthostatic intolerance as well as sleep disorders. The majority of the patients suffer at some period of the disease from lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Awareness and treatment of these conditions is vital to improving health and quality of life in patients with MS. The increased understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in autonomic dysfunction in MS, along with technological and pharmaceutical developments has advanced our ability to treat the multiple aspects complicating autonomic failure in MS.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^743211b0]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) prevalence and impact — Reported prevalence varies from ~3% to 5% in early type 1 diabetes, to 44% over 23 years of mean follow‑up, with rates as high as 60% in earlier cohorts with long‑standing type 2 diabetes and up to 25% in more contemporary recent‑onset type 2 diabetes cohorts. Timely detection may help implementation of tailored interventions to mitigate complications including cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction leading to congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and all‑cause mortality, yet CAN is frequently overlooked in clinical practice due to subtle early presentation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic neuropathy, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess for symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic dizziness, syncope, resting tachycardia, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities) starting at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter in patients with evidence of other microvascular complications, particularly kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Morphological substrate of autonomic failure and neurohormonal dysfunction in multiple system atrophy: impact on determining phenotype spectrum [^d879df09]. Acta Neuropathologica (2007). Low credibility.

Autonomic failure is a prominent clinical feature of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Neurohormonal dysfunction is also a frequent accompaniment in patients with MSA. The determination of the pathological involvement of the autonomic neurons, which are responsible for circadian rhythms and responses to stress, provides new insight into autonomic failure and neurohormonal dysfunction in MSA. The disruptions of circadian rhythms and responses to stress may underlie the impairment of homeostatic integration responsible for cardiovascular and respiratory failures. These notions lead to the hypothesis that a pathological involvement of autonomic neurons is a significant factor of the poor prognosis of MSA. Beyond this perspective, endeavors to find the morphological phenotype that represents a predominant loss of autonomic neurons may elucidate the full spectrum of pathological involvements in MSA.

### Non-pharmacological and drug treatment of autonomic dysfunction in multiple system atrophy: current status and future directions [^0731b684]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, fatal, and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology that is clinically characterized by autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs in any combination. Early onset and extensive autonomic dysfunction, including cardiovascular dysfunction characterized by orthostatic hypotension (OH) and supine hypertension, urinary dysfunction characterized by overactive bladder and incomplete bladder emptying, sexual dysfunction characterized by sexual desire deficiency and erectile dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction characterized by delayed gastric emptying and constipation, are the main features of MSA. Autonomic dysfunction greatly reduces quality of life and increases mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis and intervention are urgently needed to benefit MSA patients. In this review, we aim to discuss the systematic treatment of autonomic dysfunction in MSA, and focus on the current methods, starting from non-pharmacological methods, such as patient education, psychotherapy, diet change, surgery, and neuromodulation, to various drug treatments targeting autonomic nerve and its projection fibers. In addition, we also draw attention to the interactions among various treatments, and introduce novel methods proposed in recent years, such as gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and neural prosthesis implantation. Furthermore, we elaborate on the specific targets and mechanisms of action of various drugs. We would like to call for large-scale research to determine the efficacy of these methods in the future. Finally, we point out that studies on the pathogenesis of MSA and pathophysiological mechanisms of various autonomic dysfunction would also contribute to the development of new promising treatments and concepts.

### Wired for threat: clinical features of nervous system dysregulation in 80 children [^f66f0bef]. Pediatric Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The negative effect of perceived stress on health has become a cultural epidemic. Despite many health implications, the clinical impact of stress on the nervous system is not well understood. This case series describes the symptom profiles of 80 children with nervous system dysregulation attributed to maladaptive neuroendocrine responses to stress.

Methods

We reviewed of 80 children with nervous system dysregulation identified from a single, tertiary care pediatric neurology clinic. Included patients were between five and 17 years of age, with unexplained medical symptoms lasting three months or longer affecting at least four of six neurological domains: (1) somatization, (2) executive function, (3) autonomic function, (4) digestion, (5) sleep, and (6) emotional regulation. Medical symptoms, diagnoses, and detailed social histories were collected.

Results

Of 80 children, 57 were female (71%), 57 were Caucasian (71%), with median age of 14 years. Symptoms had a mean duration of 32 months, and included: 100% somatic symptoms, 100% emotional dysregulation, 92.5% disrupted sleep, 82.5% autonomic dysregulation, 75% executive dysfunction, and 66% digestive problems. Overall, 94% reported chronic or traumatic stressors; adverse childhood experiences were present in 65%.

Conclusions

Perceived stress impacts many functions of the neuroendocrine system through experience-dependent plasticity, resulting in a constellation of symptoms and functional impairments we describe as nervous system dysregulation. The pathophysiology of these symptoms involves dysregulation of subcortical, hormonal, and autonomic circuits, which remain largely untested. Recognition and understanding of maladaptive neurophysiology in stress-related symptoms has important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and advances in health research.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^53eaf517]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Impaired blood regulation is common in older people, whether due to physiological changes in the baroreflex, age-related diseases or states, or autonomic neuropathies. The consequences — OH and associated hypertension — are debilitating conditions and herald poor prognosis. Identifying the underlying cause, understanding the associated pathophysiology and mitigating exacerbating factors through predominantly lifestyle measures are essential. Future work should focus on identifying optimal BP targets for these individuals, particularly the frailest patients at highest risk of falls and injury.

### Pure autonomic failure [^d58f916d]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Pure autonomic failure is a degenerative disorder of the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients experience symptomatic hypotension that requires them to sit, squat or lie down to prevent syncope. It is associated with characteristic histopathological findings, resulting in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the peripheral autonomic nerves. These lesions are responsible for defects in the synthesis and release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals, resulting in significant hypotension. Patients with autonomic failure also have exaggerated blood pressure responses to common stimuli such as food or fluid intake, heat, exercise and medications. Tilt table (head-up) testing is probably the test most commonly used to establish the diagnosis. However, simple office testing is also useful, such as having the patient stand after lying supine with blood pressure monitoring. Treatment options range from simply increasing fluid and salt intake, and using compressive garments, to medications administered orally, subcutaneously or intravenously in more severe cases.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: a joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European federation of autonomic societies: a joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European federation of autonomic societies [^525d6279]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2005, the ANS panel of the European Federation of Neurological Societies conducted a survey on the distribution of ANS laboratories in Europe, asking for information on applied methods and equipment, existence of own normative data, commercial versus self‐developed systems, and research and educational activities. Although this survey included all types of ANS laboratories (i.e. cardiological, endocrinological, etc.) and not only neurologically oriented ANS laboratories, it pinpointed a high heterogeneity in ANS services across Europe and, most importantly, large diversities in the techniques used to investigate ANS disorders, altogether highlighting an unmet need for ANS testing standards across European countries.

Recently, many efforts have been made to standardize clinical assessment of the ANS. Consensus definitions have been published to diagnose key aspects of cardiovascular autonomic failure, such as orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. The European Federation of Autonomic Societies (EFAS), endorsed by the American Autonomic Society (AAS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), provided recommendations on the use of tilt table testing in the diagnosis of disorders that may cause transient loss of consciousness. The AAS and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) released definitions of autonomic disorders and methodological guidance for appropriate autonomic function testing. The latter consensus statement emphasized the importance of evaluating the ANS with screening batteries encompassing tests of sympathetic adrenergic, cardiovagal and sudomotor function. In case of pathological findings, the severity of autonomic impairment in the different domains can be graded with a 10‐point Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) after normalizing each component for the confounding effects of age and gender.

All the above international scientific efforts, together with the improvement of signal processing methodologies, increased availability of devices for autonomic function testing, and new treatment approaches have recently led to significant advances in the diagnosis and management of autonomic disorders. However, it is still unclear whether access to ANS healthcare facilities and the characteristics thereof are homogeneous across European regions.

In this joint effort between the Scientific Panel for ANS Disorders of the EAN and the EFAS, we aimed to identify neurology‐driven or interdisciplinary (with at least one neurologist in the core team) clinical ANS laboratories in Europe, to understand the laboratory characteristics in terms of equipment, personnel, metrics, case mixture of the patients and research focus, and to investigate the differences in each of the studied variables among different European regions. Finally, we aimed to identify laboratories that have the necessary equipment for calculation of the CASS.

### Cardiovascular autonomic testing in extrapyramidal disorders [^7efbbd58]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure in extrapyramidal disease. Autonomic function tests can identify parasympathetic and sympathetic dysfunction. While specialized tests are only available in autonomic labs, routine tests such as 24h ambulatory blood pressure measurements can be broadly used in clinical practice eg. as screening tests. In this review, we briefly introduce functional cardiovascular autonomic testing and propose a workup plan for patients with extrapyramidal disease. In all patients with extrapyramidal disease, screening for autonomic dysfunction should be performed. In the case of pathological findings, detailed autonomic testing should be considered with repeated measurements at follow up visits.

### Autonomic abnormalities in children with functional abdominal pain: coincidence or etiology? [^29288abc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that autonomic neuropathies may adversely affect gastrointestinal motility by involving the extrinsic nerves of the gut. The authors' hypothesize that functional abdominal pain in children is associated with generalized autonomic dysfunction.

Methods

The authors performed detailed autonomic testing in eight patients with functional abdominal pain, including deep breathing, Valsalva, tilting (to assess parasympathetic and sympathetic adrenergic function), and axon-reflex function and thermoregulatory sweat testing to assess sympathetic cholinergic function. Patients also completed a questionnaire regarding other autonomic symptoms.

Results

Results of autonomic testing were abnormal in seven patients. Parasympathetic function was normal in all, and the abnormalities were restricted to sympathetic cardiac, vasomotor, and sudomotor function. Abnormal results of axon-reflex testing in six were consistent with peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Five had decreased sweating over the abdomen, determined by thermoregulatory sweat testing. Five eight had nongastrointestinal autonomic symptoms, primarily palpitations and flushing.

Conclusions

Functional abdominal pain in the current patients is associated with generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. This dysfunction can be peripheral or central in different individuals but seems to be restricted to the sympathetic branch. The known function of the sympathetic nervous system as the motility "brake" suggests that pain could be a manifestation of unmodulated peristalsis, resulting in abdominal cramps.

### An update on MSA: premotor and non-motor features open a window of opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention [^5633aee0]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this review, we describe the wide clinical spectrum of features that can be seen in multiple system atrophy (MSA) with a focus on the premotor phase and the non-motor symptoms providing an up-to-date overview of the current understanding in this fast-growing field. First, we highlight the non-motor features at disease onset when MSA can be indistinguishable from pure autonomic failure or other chronic neurodegenerative conditions. We describe the progression of clinical features to aid the diagnosis of MSA early in the disease course. We go on to describe the levels of diagnostic certainty and we discuss MSA subtypes that do not fit into the current diagnostic criteria, highlighting the complexity of the disease as well as the need for revised diagnostic tools. Second, we describe the pathology, clinical description, and investigations of cardiovascular autonomic failure, urogenital and sexual dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, and respiratory and REM-sleep behavior disorders, which may precede the motor presentation by months or years. Their presence at presentation, even in the absence of ataxia and parkinsonism, should be regarded as highly suggestive of the premotor phase of MSA. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of the broader spectrum of clinical features of MSA and especially the non-motor features at disease onset represent a window of opportunity for disease-modifying interventions.

### The movement disorder society criteria for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy [^ac4ad5b9]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

It is acknowledged that these new criteria for possible prodromal MSA are limited to patients who develop early autonomic dysfunction or RBD and exclude those who present with early motor or other non‐motor features in the absence of these. Future research involving diagnostic biomarkers (see later) will certainly expand this category to include patients with a broader range of presenting features.

### Autonomic nervous system abnormalities in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: a cardiovascular neurophysiologic study [^5cdf805b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is part of the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) clinical picture, but few data are available on this topic. The present study is aimed to report a detailed investigation of autonomic nervous system in patients with molecular diagnosis of SCA type 2, one of the most frequent forms and the commonest in Italy. Nine patients with a mild to moderate form of SCA2 underwent a questionnaire about dysautonomic symptoms and a complete cardiovascular neurophysiologic evaluation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic system, comprising head-up tilt, standing, isometric hand grip, cold pressure, mental arithmetic, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing, and hyperventilation tests. An echocardiographic study and Holter-ECG recording were also performed. All patients complained dysautonomic problems regarding urinary tract, cardiovascular system, or gastrointestinal dysfunction. The neurophysiologic study showed both sympathetic and parasympathetic involvement, with highly variable degree and pattern of dysautonomia. The present study results show that the autonomic dysfunction is common in SCA2 representing a significant component of the complex picture of the disease. We found a wide spectrum of cardiovascular autonomic abnormalities, without a typical pattern of dysfunction and without correlation with clinical variables.

### Differential impact of individual autonomic domains on clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease [^48e33aa0]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, our results showed that among autonomic domains, cardiovascular dysautonomia was associated with a higher risk of developing disability milestones and worse progression of functional impairment and HRQoL over the course of 5 years. Whether cardiovascular dysautonomia directly causes worse outcomes in PD or is only one of the features of a multifaceted malignant phenotype remains a major knowledge gap. To clarify these hypotheses, and to determine the potential role of delaying, or even preventing, the development of dementia and other disability milestones by treating cardiovascular dysautonomia, additional prospective research in larger multicentric cohorts is needed.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^fb712069]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.6 Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System

Autonomic disorders were not considered in the ICS consensus statement, yet the dominant role of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems in lower urinary tract function means such disorders have a high chance of eliciting LUTS and LUTD. This can be primary autonomic dysfunction, or a significant autonomic component of another neurological condition. Such disorders can present as a myriad of symptoms depending upon the organ affected. Patients can present to an eye specialist for dry eyes and blurred vision, a cardiologist for palpitations, orthostatic light‐headedness or syncope, a musculoskeletal specialist for orthostatic pain over the back of the neck extending to both shoulders in the distribution of a coat hanger, a gastroenterologist for abdominal bloating, and altered bowel movements ranging between constipation and diarrhea, or a neurologist when autonomic failure is associated with neurological symptoms such as imbalance, falls and limb sensorimotor symptoms. Patients present to a urologist or gynecologist when the autonomic innervation to the LUT and genitalia is affected, presenting with storage and voiding symptoms, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, sexual arousal disorders and/or poor ejaculation. Autonomic disorders can be grouped according to the site of neurological localization:
1 Central disorders, for example α‐synucleinopathy neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease, MSA, Dementia with Lewy bodies).
2 Peripheral disorders.

a. Pure autonomic failure, for example autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, in which high titres of antibodies against the neuronal ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are identified.
b. Small fiber neuropathies, for example due to diabetes, amyloidosis (Amyloid light chain [AL] or Amyloid transthyretin protein [ATTR] aggregation), or autoimmune vasculitis (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome).
c. Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies.

Urogenital symptoms are reported in all of these disorders. In general, it is not known how often the initial medical presentation is seen in a LUTS clinic. MSA is well‐recognized for this, likely from early sacral spinal cord involvement associated with erectile dysfunction, detrusor underactivity or OAB symptoms during a prodromal pre‐motor phase of the disease. MSA can present initially with urinary retention.

### Diabetic autonomic neuropathy [^d3be5447]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a serious and common complication of diabetes. Despite its relationship to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and its association with multiple symptoms and impairments, the significance of DAN has not been fully appreciated. The reported prevalence of DAN varies widely depending on the cohort studied and the methods of assessment. In randomly selected cohorts of asymptomatic individuals with diabetes, approximately 20% had abnormal cardiovascular autonomic function. DAN frequently coexists with other peripheral neuropathies and other diabetic complications, but DAN may be isolated, frequently preceding the detection of other complications. Major clinical manifestations of DAN include resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, gastroparesis, erectile dysfunction, sudomotor dysfunction, impaired neurovascular function, "brittle diabetes", and hypoglycemic autonomic failure. DAN may affect many organ systems throughout the body (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI], genitourinary, and cardiovascular). GI disturbances (e.g., esophageal enteropathy, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence) are common, and any section of the GI tract may be affected. Gastroparesis should be suspected in individuals with erratic glucose control. Upper-GI symptoms should lead to consideration of all possible causes, including autonomic dysfunction. Whereas a radiographic gastric emptying study can definitively establish the diagnosis of gastroparesis, a reasonable approach is to exclude autonomic dysfunction and other known causes of these upper-GI symptoms. Constipation is the most common lower-GI symptom but can alternate with episodes of diarrhea. Diagnostic approaches should rule out autonomic dysfunction and the well-known causes such as neoplasia. Occasionally, anorectal manometry and other specialized tests typically performed by the gastroenterologist may be helpful. DAN is also associated with genitourinary tract disturbances including bladder and/or sexual dysfunction. Evaluation of bladder dysfunction should be performed for individuals with diabetes who have recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, incontinence, or a palpable bladder. Specialized assessment of bladder dysfunction will typically be performed by a urologist. In men, DAN may cause loss of penile erection and/or retrograde ejaculation. A complete workup for erectile dysfunction in men should include history (medical and sexual); psychological evaluation; hormone levels; measurement of nocturnal penile tumescence; tests to assess penile, pelvic, and spinal nerve function; cardiovascular autonomic function tests; and measurement of penile and brachial blood pressure. Neurovascular dysfunction resulting from DAN contributes to a wide spectrum of clinical disorders including erectile dysfunction, loss of skin integrity, and abnormal vascular reflexes. Disruption of microvascular skin blood flow and sudomotor function may be among the earliest manifestations of DAN and lead to dry skin, loss of sweating, and the development of fissures and cracks that allow microorganisms to enter. These changes ultimately contribute to the development of ulcers, gangrene, and limb loss. Various aspects of neurovascular function can be evaluated with specialized tests, but generally these have not been well standardized and have limited clinical utility. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is the most studied and clinically important form of DAN. Meta-analyses of published data demonstrate that reduced cardiovascular autonomic function as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) is strongly (i.e., relative risk is doubled) associated with an increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and mortality. The determination of the presence of CAN is usually based on a battery of autonomic function tests rather than just on one test. Proceedings from a consensus conference in 1992 recommended that three tests (R-R variation, Valsalva maneuver, and postural blood pressure testing)or longitudinal testing of the cardiovascular autonomic system. Other forms of autonomic neuropathy can be evaluated with specialized tests, but these are less standardized and less available than commonly used tests of cardiovascular autonomic function, which quantify loss of HRV. Interpretability of serial HRV testing requires accurate, precise, and reproducible procedures that use established physiological maneuvers. The battery of three recommended tests for assessing CAN is readily performed in the average clinic, hospital, or diagnostic center with the use of available technology. Measurement of HRV at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and within 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (unless an individual has symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction earlier) serves to establish a baseline, with which 1-year interval tests can be compared. Regular HRV testing provides early detection and thereby promotes timely diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. HRV testing may also facilitate differential diagnosis and the attribution of symptoms (e.g., erectile dysfunction, dyspepsia, and dizziness) to autonomic dysfunction. Finally, knowledge of early autonomic dysfunction can encourage patient and physician to improve metabolic control and to use therapies such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, proven to be effective for patients with CAN.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: expert review [^8508a30a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — diagnostic criteria and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are defined by an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats/min within 10 minutes of upright posture (≥ 40 beats/min in adolescents 12–19 years of age) with an absence of orthostatic hypotension, with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance present for at least 6 months and not explained by other causes. GI symptoms may be common in POTS, including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, and severe constipation, of which nausea, pain, and early satiety are the most predictive of abnormal GI motility.

### Glycaemic control, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, and high cardiovascular risk are associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy [^f9802af5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a life-threatening complication associated with diabetes and is defined as "the impairment of autonomic control of the cardiovascular system" by the Toronto Consensus. CAN may manifest with a myriad of symptoms and complications, including dizziness, light-headedness, palpitations, blurred vision, fainting, syncope, exercise intolerance, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension. However, symptoms occur in advanced stages beyond the point of reversibility. In contrast, early manifestations are often silent or diffuse and, thus, frequently underdiagnosed, leading to increased risk of morbidity and mortality, resulting in higher healthcare costs. Currently, the best treatment option for CAN is haltering progression by early recognition, lifestyle changes, and high-intensity glucose-lowering treatments.

CAN has been found to affect up to 65% of people with type 2 diabetes and is present in between 16 and 32% of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. CAN can also be present in individuals without diabetes, with studies finding a prevalence of 11–20% in prediabetes, while some studies report CAN in normoglycemic obese people. Prediabetes is the earliest stage of glucose dysregulation, the intermediate stage between normoglycemia and diabetes. A specific glucose threshold at which autonomic function becomes impaired has not been established, and thus, glucose levels in the prediabetic range may also have a neurotoxic effect. Alternatively, the development of CAN in the absence of diabetes and sustained hyperglycaemia suggests an alternate pathway. Many factors like prediabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease have all been suggested to be factors related to the development of CAN together with or in the absence of hyperglycaemia. However, which factors play the most prominent role at different stages of CAN or in people with or without diabetes is still discussed.

The purpose of this study was to compare CAN scores in people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and without diabetes and to investigate which factors contributed the most to the CAN scores. We hypothesized that haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) would play a role in diabetes, while other cardiovascular risk factors would contribute to people under normoglycemic conditions.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^e8c9666a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — autonomic dysfunction and exertional intolerance describe that reduced tolerance of physical exertion is common after concussion with symptom provocation, that poor tolerance may be associated with later-emerging fatigue, and that the extent and mechanisms are not systematically studied; autonomic dysfunction may contribute, including hypothesized uncoupling of the central autonomic nervous system and the heart with reduced ability to maintain and adjust cerebral blood flow, blood pressure, and/or heart rate during exertion; autonomic dysregulation has been linked to higher perceived exertion after concussion and may be captured by orthostatic hypotension assessments, with deconditioning or secondary inactivity as another potential source of poor exertion tolerance.

### Clinical reasoning: a 72-year-old man with progressive pan-dysautonomia [^c3426f3e]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysautonomia is a common clinical feature among many central and peripheral neurologic disorders. Evaluation of patients with dysautonomia can be challenging in the absence of a previously established neurologic diagnosis. In this case, we discuss a 72-year-old man who presented with 9 months of progressive dysautonomia including orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and constipation. A combination of autonomic testing and serologic testing confirmed the final diagnosis. This case highlights the differential diagnosis of autonomic failure, emphasizing the role of specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging cues in guiding clinical reasoning.

### Autonomic nervous system dysfunction in advanced cancer [^77d7a2ef]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) innervates every organ in the body and is largely involuntary. There have been reports of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients, but most are case reports. There are suggestions that this abnormality may be common in advanced cancer. Inpatients and outpatients with advanced cancer were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of a disease associated with autonomic nervous system (ANS) abnormalities, or had taken or were taking drugs affecting the ANS. Autonomic function was evaluated using five bedside cardiovascular tests: (1) heart rate response to deep breathing, (2) heart rate response to standing, (3) heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver, (4) blood pressure response to standing and (5) blood pressure response to static exercise. Each test result was scored according to a validated scale of 0,.5, or 1. The individual scores were added together and each patient received a dysfunction score: none (= 0–1), mild (= 1.5–2), moderate (= 2.5–3) or severe (= 3.5–5). Twenty-eight men and 22 women participated, median age was 64 years. The median ECOG performance status was 2. Lung and prostate cancer were the most common (N = 9, 5). 245 tests were performed; 86 (35%) individual tests were normal or borderline. Composite dysfunction scores were calculated; all the participants had a score consistent with abnormality. The median number of symptoms was 6 (range 1–15). Twenty-eight rated at least one symptom as severe (median 2, range 0–5), but symptoms did not correlate with test abnormalities. The results reveal significant ANS dysfunction in advanced cancer. There are more invasive tests that may give more accurate descriptions of ANS abnormalities in this population. These tests may help define the lesion better than these simple bedside tests. Further research with sophisticated ANS testing is needed to clearly define this paraneoplastic syndrome.

### Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects symptom generation and brain-gut axis [^3ef513e9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of severe peripheral, autonomous, and central neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy classically manifests as progressive symmetric thick-fiber (Aβ) and thin-fiber (Aδ) neuropathy affecting axons of the distal lower extremities. Patients may also suffer from diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). According to the Toronto criteria, DAN is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the setting of diabetes or metabolic derangements. DAN may affect cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and urogenital systems and sudomotor function. Autonomic abnormalities can be classified as structural or functional disorders, and they may be subclinical, diagnosable only by tests, or clinical, with symptoms or signs.

As many as 50% of diabetic patients with long duration of the disease have severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, and abdominal pain. These symptoms likely represent clinical DAN, leading to significant reduction in quality of life and presenting a severe socioeconomic burden.

The underlying pathogenesis of DAN is multifactorial and comprises gastrointestinal motility dysfunction, metabolic insults to internal nerve fibers, neurovascular insufficiency, alterations in gastrointestinal hormone secretion, and abnormal interoception (combined perception of afferent neural trafficking from the internal organs). Clinical management of diabetic patients is therefore challenging, calling for a better understanding of the brain-gut axis. Introduction of such peptides as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists has contributed to understanding of this complex interaction. When released postprandially in the small intestine GLP-1 acts as a hormone or a signal to sensory vagal afferents. In the central nervous system, it primarily affects stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. When GLP-1 is released in brain hypothalamic nuclei from nerve endings originating from, for example, the solitary tract, however, it functions as a neuropeptide, affecting vagal activity and hence homeostatic regulation of the gut.

### Autonomic dysfunction is associated with disease progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^f6768dae]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the motor neurons, increasing evidence suggests that ALS should be considered as a multisystem disease with 80% of patients reporting at least one non-motor symptom. Psychiatric, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms are most common and associated with shorter survival time and reduced quality of life. Among non-motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction has been also described in ALS and reported in up to 75% of patients, mild in most patients (85%), and moderate in a minority (15%). The most experienced symptoms include urinary urgency and frequency in 40% of patients and gastrointestinal dysfunction, most typically constipation, in 50%. Although less disabling to patients, cardiovagal abnormalities, including reduced heart rate variability, are also present in 50% of patients, though more serious cardiovascular autonomic failure appears rare and only in more advanced disease stages. Since the autonomic nervous system is responsible for the control of vital functions, its impairment has been consistently associated with shorter survival in several neurological diseases, such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy Body and progressive supranuclear palsy. However, autonomic symptoms have not been systematically assessed as prognostic factors in ALS. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were: first, to investigate in a longitudinal study whether the presence of autonomic symptoms at diagnosis can predict disease progression and survival; and second, to instrumentally assess autonomic dysfunction over time using a simple parasympathetic marker, such as the heart rate variability (HRV).

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^03f8cc19]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Table 2 — holistic assessment for suspected Long COVID emphasizes symptom characterization, timelines, modifiers, function, and exam. Symptom identification should note features such as symptom flare 12–48 h after minimal activity (PEM/PESE). Timeline features include symptoms lasting at least 3 months (continuously or relapsing–remitting) and being new or worsened after suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (supportive but not diagnostic). Modifiers/triggers include physical and cognitive activities, social and emotional stressors, and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccines, boosters. Functional impact spans activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) alongside work/school, family, social, and exercise capacity. Physical exam includes a 10-min stand test in which clinicians record heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) after supine for 5 min and then after standing for 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, with observation of signs and symptoms; Table 1 of the autonomic dysfunction consensus guidance statement outlines diagnostic criteria for POTS, NCS, OH, and IST that incorporate results of the 10-min stand test.

### Mechanisms of enteric neuropathy in diverse contexts of gastrointestinal dysfunction [^65c38c7a]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the largest and most complex branch of the autonomic nervous system and fulfills integrative functions to provide moment‐to‐moment command of gastrointestinal motility, fluid exchange, and immune homeostasis. The cellular units of the ENS are enteric neurons and glia, which are organized into two interconnected, gangliated plexuses with neurocircuits that control mucosal functions in the submucosal plexus and patterns of motor activity in the myenteric plexus. Intrinsic (enteric) neurocircuits interact extensively with extrinsic parasympathetic, sympathetic, and sensory neurons to coordinate homeostatic signaling along the brain–gut axis and adapt to ongoing systemic needs. Enteric neurons and glia also exhibit extensive bi‐directional interactions with gut immune cells that influence local and systemic defensive functions.

Given the central role of the ENS in coordinating gut functions, it is of little surprise that conditions in which the neural innervation supplying the GI tract is impaired produce major disturbances in normal gut activities that are long‐lasting and difficult to treat. Collectively, these conditions are referred to as enteric neuropathies and present with abnormal gut motility, secretions, pain, immune dysregulation, and disrupted signaling along the gut–brain axis due to enteric neuroplasticity, which involves functional reorganization of neuron properties and intercellular signaling. The conditions under which enteric neuropathy occurs are diverse and the mechanistic underpinnings are incompletely understood. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the current understanding of the cell types involved, the conditions in which neuropathy occurs, and the mechanisms implicated in enteric neuropathy.

### Expert consensus recommendations to improve diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy [^2423b284]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the extent of the disease

Grading and staging other manifestations

Because ATTRv amyloidosis is a systemic disease, physicians should be aware of manifestations other than those of the peripheral nervous system, such as cardiac, ocular, and renal manifestations. A multidisciplinary approach is required to assess whether, through effects of autonomic dysfunction or amyloid deposition, other organs and systems are likely to be affected.

Autonomic dysfunction

Autonomic dysfunction occurs in approximately 73% of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with PN and affects the gut, bladder sphincter, genital nerves, and cardiovascular system. Common symptoms include impotence (73% of male patients), gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance (53%), urinary incontinence (50%), and orthostatic dysregulation (46%). The most common symptoms seen in the GI system include weight loss (approximately 30% of patients), early satiety, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. The incidence of GI disturbances increases as the disease progresses, and the onset of diarrhea earlier in the course of the disease is associated with shorter survival.

Other organ involvement

Amyloid can also be deposited in the heart, eyes, kidneys, and, rarely, the leptomeninges, resulting in associated organ dysfunction and clinical symptoms. Cardiac involvement is usually asymptomatic at diagnosis but has been detected in up to 72% of patients through cardiac imaging or cardiac multimodal imaging. Cardiac involvement is associated with progressive myocardial infiltration, denervation, and conduction and rhythm disturbances. Systematic assessment and management of cardiac involvement is critical because cardiac manifestations worsen with disease progression and are more likely to cause death. Ophthalmic manifestations have been reported in 20% (glaucoma and/or vitreous opacities) to 70% (dry eye) of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with PN.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^f8ff20fd]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

The healthy baroreflex regulates moment-by-moment buffering of blood pressure, responding to physiological changes.
Multiple physiological and pathophysiological changes occur with ageing that impair the sensitivity of the baroreflex.
An impaired baroreflex means impaired blood pressure regulation — often resulting in orthostatic hypotension and hypertension.
Orthostatic hypotension is consistently associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Concomitant orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension commonly co-occur and require careful management

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a definition for clinical research: report of the American Academy of Neurology, the American association of electrodiagnostic medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^058ba500]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — consensus-based clinical phenotype and examination: The concept of distal symmetric polyneuropathy requires a clear definition of distal and symmetric features of polyneuropathy, where distal refers to those parts most distant from the center of the body, the polyneuropathy must begin in the feet, and symmetric indicates that the symptoms and signs are the same on both sides of the body; persistent or striking asymmetry of symptoms or signs is inconsistent with the case definition, and the case definition must encompass a description of symptoms and signs with an easily recognizable phenotype. Symptoms may be primarily sensory, primarily motor, or both, begin distally in the feet, and frequently include numbness, burning, prickling paresthesias, dysesthesias, and allodynia; distal symmetric polyneuropathy may be asymptomatic, especially in its early stage, with asymptomatic presentation more likely when positive sensory symptoms are lacking or when motor deficits alone are the presenting features. On examination, findings may include abnormalities of primary sensory modalities, motor weakness and atrophy, tendon reflex changes (especially depressed or absent ankle jerks), or autonomic system findings; sensory loss occurs in an acral, nondermatomal, non-single nerve distribution with signs evolving in a centripetal manner. Motor signs may include atrophy and weakness of intrinsic foot muscles and deformities such as hammertoes and pes cavus, although pes cavus alone is not sufficient evidence of polyneuropathy; tendon reflexes are often depressed or unelicitable, and relatively depressed or unelicitable ankle jerks are valuable signs. Signs of autonomic nervous system involvement may also constitute findings consistent with a distal symmetric polyneuropathy if small fibers are affected, with autonomic dysfunction suggested by abnormalities of sweating or circulatory instability in the feet.

### Autonomic dysfunction in Guillain-Barrésyndrome and multiple sclerosis [^12ec9d73]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

This review gives an overview of autonomic dysfunction encountered in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In GBS, cardiovascular dysregulation is common and may lead to serious bradyarrhythmias that need to be recognised for the early initiation of appropriate therapy. Although standardised autonomic tests were useful for the diagnosis of autonomic failure, they were not able to indicate vagal over-reactivity. In this regard, eyeball pressure testing may correctly identify patients at risk for impending and potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias which may easily be administered at the bedside. In MS, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is usually of minor clinical importance. However, orthostatic intolerance may be present in approximately 50% of patients and could easily be detected by routine measurements of heart rate and blood pressure during rest and during standing. More subtle alterations may require more sophisticated methods such as autonomic reflex testing or baroreflex stimulation. Several in vitro, animal and clinical studies provide evidence that there are many interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and the immune system giving rise to the hypothesis that autonomic dysfunction in MS may not only be a consequence of the disease, but may in itself affect the course of MS.

### Multiple system atrophy without dysautonomia: an autopsy-confirmed study [^039c2dce]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. Histologic hallmarks of MSA include glial cytoplasmic inclusions and neuronal cytoplasmic aggregates, each primarily containing misfolded alpha-synuclein. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein leads to neuronal degeneration in various brain regions, including the substantia nigra, striatum, inferior olivary nucleus, and cerebellum. The peripheral and autonomic nervous system may also be affected, highlighting the multisystemic nature of the disease. This results in a variable presentation of primary symptoms — parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome, and autonomic dysfunction — which complicates clinical diagnosis, especially in the early stages of the disease.

The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for the clinical diagnosis of MSA were proposed in 2022 to improve early and accurate diagnosis and have since been validated against the neuropathologic diagnostic gold standard in independent reports. A notable innovation of the MDS-MSA diagnostic criteria is the possibility of diagnosing clinically probable MSA in patients presenting with motor symptoms in the absence of dysautonomia. As patients with MSA lacking autonomic features did not receive a formal clinical diagnosis of MSA before the publication of the MDS-MSA criteria, this subgroup has historically not yet been included in natural history and interventional studies. A few cases of a possible predominant motor subtype of MSA with extended disease duration are documented. As the autonomic symptom orthostatic hypotension is a known side effect of dopaminergic therapy, we examined the distribution of Levodopa usage across groups with and without autonomic symptoms.

Therefore, we evaluate MSA with and without autonomic dysfunction in a large retrospective multicenter cohort study of autopsy-confirmed patients with MSA.

### Short term cardiovascular symptoms improvement after deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review [^7891ebf9]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and includes symptoms of altered cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, thermoregulatory, and sexual functions. Autonomic dysfunction in PD is an important determinant of disability, disease-related quality of life, and mortality. The exact mechanisms underlying autonomic dysfunction in PD remain unclear, with varying roles attributed to degeneration of the central (e.g. preganglionic neurons within brainstem nuclei like the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) and peripheral (e.g. postganglionic neurons and the enteric nervous system) autonomic nervous system, and more recently with changes in the brain regions regulating cardiovagal outflow (known as central autonomic network).

Autonomic disturbances in PD can occur at any disease stage, even preceding the onset of motor symptoms — coined 'prodromal' symptoms. Overall, cardiovascular symptoms occur in approximately 70% of PD patients. They can be present at any stage of the disease — including early in the disease course, and symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension, supine hypertension, and nocturnal non-dipping blood pressure (Fig. 1 A). Although these symptoms may often go unnoticed by the patient, they are associated with important and considerable risks. Orthostatic hypotension can be the cause of unexplained falls, and supine or nocturnal hypertension can lead to potentially fatal renal and cerebral vasculopathies. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction have been suggested to contribute to these cardiovascular symptoms. Since sympathetic denervation of the heart occurs early in the disease, objective measurement hereof with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is considered a supportive criterion in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. MIBG scintigraphy allows the discrimination between PD and multiple system atrophy, since the peripheral autonomic nervous system is preserved in the latter.
