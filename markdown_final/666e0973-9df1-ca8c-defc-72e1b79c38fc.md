## Question

4. Given three planes α, β, γ, the angle between each pair of planes is θ, and α ∩ β = a, β ∩ γ = b, γ ∩ α = c. If
Proposition A: θ > [π/3].
Proposition B: a, b, c intersect at one point.
Then
(A) A is a sufficient condition for B but not necessary;
(B) A is a necessary condition for B but not sufficient;
(C) A is a necessary and sufficient condition for B;
(D) None of (A), (B), (C) is correct.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Proposition A (all pairwise dihedral angles between three planes exceed π/3) is a sufficient, necessary, both, or neither condition for Proposition B (the three lines of intersection a, b, c meet at a single point). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and the key constraints. Then, I should verify whether A implies B by considering the limiting case and general configurations. Next, I will check whether B implies A by constructing counterexamples where the lines meet at a point but the angles are not all greater than π/3. Finally, I will synthesize the logical relationship and select the correct option, making sure I haven't overlooked any special cases or degeneracies.

> Let me first confirm the setup and terminology. We have three planes α, β, γ with pairwise dihedral angles all equal to θ, and the lines of intersection are a = α ∩ β, b = β ∩ γ, and c = γ ∩ α. Proposition A asserts θ > π/3, and Proposition B asserts that a, b, c intersect at a single point, which is equivalent to saying the three planes share a common point of concurrency [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine whether A implies B. Wait, let me verify the intuition: if all angles are large, the planes should "pinch" toward a common point. In the limiting case θ = π/3, the configuration corresponds to the three planes forming a regular trihedral angle, where the lines a, b, c indeed meet at a point. For θ > π/3, the planes become more "upright" relative to each other, which should preserve concurrency, so A appears sufficient for B. I should double-check that there isn't a degenerate case where larger angles somehow force the lines to be parallel or skew; but in 3-space, three planes with pairwise intersections cannot have all three intersection lines parallel unless at least two planes are parallel, which would violate the assumption of a constant nonzero angle between each pair, so concurrency is maintained when θ > π/3. Thus, A is sufficient for B [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether B implies A. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: concurrency of a, b, c does not constrain the pairwise angles to be larger than π/3. I need a counterexample where the lines meet at a point but θ ≤ π/3. Consider three planes intersecting at a single point with θ = π/3 exactly; this is the regular trihedral case, so B holds while A does not. I can also imagine configurations where θ is even smaller than π/3 and the lines still concur, for example by "flattening" the trihedral angle while keeping a common vertex. Therefore, B does not require A, so A is not necessary for B [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the logical relationship. A implies B, but B does not imply A; in other words, A is sufficient for B but not necessary for B. This matches option (A). I should confirm that none of the other choices fit: (B) would require B to imply A, which we've refuted; (C) would require bidirectional implication, which fails; and (D) would only be correct if neither sufficiency nor necessity held, which is not the case here [^notfound].

> Final answer: (A) A is a sufficient condition for B but not necessary [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **(A) A is a sufficient condition for B but not necessary**.

- **Sufficiency**: If the angle between each pair of planes is greater than π/3, the three planes must intersect at a single point, so A implies B.
- **Not necessary**: The three planes can intersect at a single point even when the angle between some pairs is π/3 or less, so B does not require A.

Thus, A is sufficient but not necessary for B.

---

## Geometric interpretation

Let the three planes be α, β, and γ, with pairwise intersections a = α ∩ β, b = β ∩ γ, and c = γ ∩ α. The angle between each pair of planes is θ. We need to determine how θ > π/3 relates to the concurrency of a, b, and c.

---

## Sufficiency of A for B

If θ > π/3, the planes are "steeply" oriented relative to each other, which forces the three intersection lines to meet at a single point. This is because the dihedral angles are large enough that the planes cannot form a prism-like configuration (where the lines are parallel) and must instead converge at a point. Thus, **A implies B**.

---

## Necessity of A for B

However, B does not require A. The three planes can intersect at a single point even when θ ≤ π/3. For example, if θ = π/3, the planes can still meet at a point, and even for θ < π/3, certain configurations still yield concurrent lines. Therefore, **B does not imply A**.

---

## Conclusion

A is a **sufficient condition** for B, but it is **not necessary**. The correct choice is **(A)**.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

Table 3
Step counts (based on increments of 500 steps) to accumulate in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps by the end of the day

Details on how these recommendations were derived are provided in the Supplementary Method.

*Same as the "Overall" group.

The step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants aged 17–59 were similar but were generally more than those required for participants aged 60 and above (Table 3). There were also differences in the step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants with BMI less than 27.5 kg/m 2 on weekdays.

Across different demographics, participants aged between 30 and 39 who had accumulated fewer than 7500 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to participants aged 60 and above (Supplementary Fig. S6). Males who had accumulated fewer than 5000 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to females on weekdays, and no sex differences among those who accumulated 5000 steps or more. Participants with normal BMI were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day on weekdays, but they could also have higher mean step counts on weekends compared to participants with obese BMI. The mean step difference between participants with normal BMI and participants with obese BMI decreased with time, with little difference at 10 p.m.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^3c363d65]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.
