## Question

Make assessment and plan with patient with left acute parotitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an assessment and plan for a patient with left acute parotitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the focused history and exam to distinguish viral from bacterial and identify red flags. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic workup, including when to image and what labs to order. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and how to prioritize it. After that, I need to outline management by etiology, including antibiotics, supportive care, and when to drain. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, reassessment timelines, and special-population considerations, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and that I double-check any assumptions I make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the key elements of the history that separate viral from bacterial parotitis and uncover precipitating factors, because this will anchor the entire plan. I need to check for fever, pain, trismus, and whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, since bacterial disease is more often unilateral and painful with trismus, whereas viral parotitis is frequently bilateral and less likely to produce purulence from Stensen's duct, although I should not overstate this and must examine the duct carefully for pus or erythema of the papilla [^2a259943] [^800e8b37]. I should ask about recent mumps exposure or vaccination status, influenza symptoms, and COVID-19 contacts, because mumps remains a classic cause and influenza A(H3N2) has been associated with parotitis, and COVID-19 can present with parotitis-like symptoms linked to intraparotid lymphadenitis rather than primary gland infection, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion during outbreaks and seasonality patterns [^3a0040c6] [^27c21661] [^c45e988c] [^2dd88948]. I will also screen for dehydration, malnutrition, immunosuppression, recent dental procedures, and xerogenic medications, since these predispose to suppurative disease and will influence both diagnostics and empiric therapy choices [^2a259943] [^4644d078].

> Wait, let me verify the physical exam priorities so I do not miss a drainable abscess or a stone. I should inspect the overlying skin for erythema and induration, palpate for focal fluctuance suggesting abscess, and gently massage the gland to express secretions from Stensen's duct, looking for pus that would support bacterial disease and guide culture acquisition, while also checking for trismus and lymphadenopathy that might signal deeper infection or alternative diagnoses [^2a259943] [^d8a9f34c]. I need to ensure I examine the oral cavity for dental caries, periodontitis, or mucosal lesions that could be a source of ascending infection, and I should document the size and tenderness of the gland to track response to therapy [^2a259943].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic workup and confirm when imaging is actually indicated. If the diagnosis is straightforward viral parotitis, imaging is not routinely needed, but I should obtain ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT if there is concern for abscess, severe pain with trismus, immunocompromise, or failure to improve, because ultrasound can detect collections and ductal stones, while CT better delineates deep-space extension and is preferred in the emergency setting when complications are suspected [^800e8b37] [^d8a9f34c] [^5009558b]. Hold on, I should verify the lab strategy: in suspected mumps, I should send buccal swab for RT-PCR ideally within 0–3 days of parotitis onset, and consider serology if PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, whereas in suspected bacterial disease I should obtain CBC, inflammatory markers, and culture any expressed pus from Stensen's duct before antibiotics when feasible to guide targeted therapy [^341be679] [^2a259943].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis and make sure I do not anchor prematurely. Viral etiologies include mumps, influenza A(H3N2), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and COVID-19, with mumps classically bilateral and influenza-associated parotitis often unilateral and more common in males and younger patients, while COVID-19 parotitis-like presentations reflect intraparotid lymphadenitis rather than primary sialadenitis, so I should correlate with exposure risks and seasonality before concluding [^3a0040c6] [^27c21661] [^c45e988c] [^2dd88948]. Bacterial suppurative parotitis is most often due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species, with anaerobes increasingly recognized and β-lactamase producers common, so I need to ensure empiric coverage addresses both aerobes and anaerobes when bacterial disease is suspected [^2a259943] [^d8a9f34c]. Obstructive causes like sialolithiasis or stricture should be considered if symptoms are recurrent or meal-related, and in children I must remember juvenile recurrent parotitis and, rarely, primary pediatric Sjögren syndrome, which present with recurrent swelling and may require targeted evaluation and rheumatology referral if suspected [^4644d078] [^9dd4e79b].

> Let me think about management for viral parotitis, and I should double-check that I am not over-treating. Supportive care is the mainstay: hydration, analgesics, warm compresses, gentle gland massage, and sialagogues such as sugar-free lemon drops to stimulate salivary flow, with isolation precautions tailored to the specific virus and local public health guidance, particularly for mumps where droplet precautions are recommended for 5 days after onset of parotitis in healthcare settings [^2a259943] [^537c65ad]. I should confirm that no antibiotics are indicated for uncomplicated viral parotitis, and I will arrange follow-up within 48–72 hours to ensure improvement and reassess if symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative measures [^notfound].

> For suspected bacterial suppurative parotitis, I need to ensure timely empiric antibiotics and address predisposing factors. Initial therapy should cover Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and anaerobes, with consideration of local resistance patterns; reasonable empiric options include ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or a first-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, adjusting to culture results when available, and I should treat for 10–14 days depending on clinical response and severity [^2a259943] [^d8a9f34c]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a drainable collection: if there is fluctuance, persistent fever, or clinical deterioration despite 48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotics, I should obtain imaging and proceed to incision and drainage with consideration of a drain, ideally with ENT involvement to protect the facial nerve [^2a259943] [^d8a9f34c]. I also need to correct dehydration, optimize nutrition, and review medications that reduce salivary flow to reduce recurrence risk [^2a259943] [^4644d078].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or refractory to standard therapy. I should reconsider obstructive etiologies such as sialolithiasis or stricture, and if recurrent or meal-related symptoms persist, I should arrange ultrasound or sialography and consider ENT referral for sialendoscopy, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic in select cases and can be gland-sparing when appropriately indicated [^4644d078] [^58183dbd]. I need to ensure I also keep malignancy in mind when a firm, nonfluctuant mass persists or when there is a history of chronic obstructive symptoms with a new focal lesion, prompting imaging and tissue diagnosis as indicated [^d6272a1b] [^54d70f0d].

> Next, I should review special populations and make sure I tailor testing and precautions accordingly. In children, mumps and juvenile recurrent parotitis are common, and I should avoid unnecessary antibiotics in JRP while ensuring hydration, massage, and sialagogues; if attacks are frequent and severe, a short steroid course may be considered in select cases, ideally coordinated with pediatric ENT or rheumatology when autoimmune features are suspected [^9670ebac] [^33597a61]. In immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging, broader empiric coverage including gram-negatives, and early drainage if abscess is suspected, given higher risks of complications and atypical pathogens [^2a259943]. In pregnancy, I should prefer ultrasound for imaging and avoid ionizing radiation when possible, while still treating bacterial disease promptly to prevent sepsis [^notfound].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting details so we do not lose track of deterioration. Re-evaluation within 48–72 hours is prudent to ensure clinical improvement, with earlier reassessment if fever, pain, or swelling escalates, and I will educate the patient on warning signs such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, rapidly spreading erythema, or new trismus that should prompt urgent care, as these may herald deeper-space infection or airway compromise [^notfound]. I will also coordinate with primary care for vaccination updates, dental care if oral sources are identified, and ENT follow-up for recurrent or complicated disease to address structural contributors and prevent recurrences [^notfound].

For left acute parotitis, the priority is to **distinguish viral from bacterial etiologies** and assess for complications [^2a259943]. Viral parotitis (commonly mumps or influenza) is managed with supportive care, hydration, analgesics, and isolation for 5 days after onset [^537c65ad]; **no antibiotics are needed** [^notfound]. Bacterial parotitis (often Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) requires **empiric antibiotics** covering Gram-positive and anaerobic organisms (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate or clindamycin) [^2a259943] for 10–14 days, hydration, warm compresses, and sialagogues [^d6272a1b]; obtain cultures if pus is present [^2a259943]. If an abscess is suspected or the patient is immunocompromised, obtain ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT [^d8a9f34c] and arrange ENT consultation for possible drainage [^2a259943]. Reassess at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, revise the diagnosis, consider imaging, and adjust therapy [^notfound].

- **Culture-guided therapy**: Adjust based on culture and sensitivity [^2a259943].
- **Hydration and sialagogues**: Maintain salivary flow [^d6272a1b].
- **Drainage**: If abscess suspected or no improvement in 48–72 hours, obtain imaging and consult ENT for possible incision and drainage [^d8a9f34c].

---

### Follow-up and reassessment

Re-evaluate at **48–72 hours**; if there is no improvement, obtain imaging and adjust therapy [^notfound]. Monitor for complications such as abscess, facial nerve involvement, or systemic spread [^d8a9f34c].

---

## Patient education

Patient education should cover **home care** — hydration, warm compresses, oral hygiene, and sialagogues — and **warning signs** that require urgent care, including fever, worsening swelling, trismus, dyspnea, or facial weakness. For viral parotitis, explain the 5-day isolation requirement [^537c65ad].

---

## Documentation

Record the **history, exam, diagnostics, diagnosis, and management plan**, and document patient education and follow-up arrangements.

---

Left acute parotitis requires a **focused assessment** to distinguish viral from bacterial etiologies, with viral cases managed supportively and bacterial cases requiring antibiotics, hydration, and possible drainage. Reassessment at 48–72 hours ensures timely adjustment if the course is atypical or complications arise.

### Chronic parotitis: a challenging disease entity [^4add673f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic parotitis is a troubling clinical condition characterized by repeated infection and inflammation of the parotid gland caused by decreased salivary flow or obstruction. Unilateral swelling, pain, and other associated symptoms occur during acute exacerbations of the disease. A variety of laboratory and radiographic tools are available to aid in the diagnosis. Multiple treatment options have been proposed, ranging from conservative medical management to surgical interventions. We present 2 patients with bilateral chronic parotitis who attempted prolonged medical management and ultimately required surgical parotidectomy for control of their disease.

Conclusion

In regions with a high prevalence of FMF, maintaining a strong clinical suspicion for the disease is essential in patients presenting with recurrent organ involvement characterized by episodic attacks. The atypical findings observed in our case, including parotitis and orchitis, highlight the diverse and often unpredictable clinical manifestations. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are paramount to prevent severe complications, with amyloidosis being one of the most serious consequences. By recognizing and addressing FMF in a timely manner, health care providers can effectively mitigate the risk of long-term complications and improve patient outcomes.

As the 2019 coronavirus pandemic has unfolded, an increasing number of atypical presentations of COVID-19 have been reported. As patients with COVID-19 often present to emergency departments for initial care, it is important that emergency clinicians are familiar with these atypical presentations in order to prevent disease transmission. We present a case of a 21-year-old woman diagnosed in our ED with COVID-19 associated parotitis and review the epidemiology and management of parotitis. We discuss the importance of considering COVID-19 in the differential of parotitis and other viral-associated syndromes and emphasize the importance of donning personal protective equipment during the initial evaluation.

Acute bacterial parotitis

Acute bacterial parotitis may be due to direct inoculation of the ductal epithelium or ascending oral cavity infection. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. and less commonly, anaerobic pathogens. Unlike viral parotitis, acute bacterial parotitis presents as by painful swelling, fever, erythema of the overlying skin and sometimes trismus. Pus may be manually expressed from Stensen's duct. Urgent ultrasonography and/or computed tomography (CT) may be required to search for local complications, suppurated parotitis and parotid abscess (Fig. 5), which are seen as fluid collection(s) within an enlarged hypervascular gland. Rarely is lithiasis found in Stensen's duct. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment.

Cat scratch disease

Cat scratch disease is an infection caused by Bartonella henselae, a Gram-negative bacteria transmitted by a cat scratch or bite. It is typically a chronic lymphadenopathy involving the upper limb or the head and neck, including the parotid gland. Imaging workup shows necrotic lymphadenitis: hypoechoic lymph node with peripheral hypervascularization on ultrasonography, and a hypodense lymph node with rim enhancement and surrounding soft tissue edematous swelling on CT (Fig. 6). These imaging features may mimic malignant disorders (metastasis, sarcoma or hemopathy) or other infectious, pyogenic or mycobacterial conditions. The diagnosis should be raised in young children exposed to cat(s) and confirmed by serology or PCR of a lymph node biopsy. In most cases, the clinical evolution is spontaneously favorable, and antibiotics are reserved for severe or systemic disease.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions address computed tomography (CT) imaging and treatment choices for acute diverticulitis, including test accuracy of CT for diagnosis or staging (KQ 1a), effects of CT on clinical outcomes and changes in clinical management (KQ 1b), downstream outcomes of falsely abnormal or falsely normal CT readings in uncomplicated or complicated disease (KQ 1c), and incidental findings among patients presenting with acute abdominal pain with possible diverticulitis (KQ 1d). Benefits and harms of treatment options are addressed overall (KQ 2), including outpatient management versus hospitalization for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (KQ 2a), antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis (KQ 2b), and interventional radiology procedures versus conservative management for acute complicated diverticulitis (KQ 2c). Subquestions examine whether accuracy, effects, and harms vary by patient characteristics, presentation or course of illness, or other factors.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^40c35588]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent," and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong," with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another," and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role." For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear," and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm."

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^9fd015e4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

American College of Physicians clinical guideline — scope, methods, and target population: The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults, based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage, using GRADE methodology and outcomes rated as critical or important. The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^e21bd682]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Radiological imaging techniques that are used for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in the emergency setting are computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US). CT imaging is becoming by now the gold standard in the diagnosis and staging of patients with ALCD. CT imaging with intravenous contrast has excellent sensitivity and specificity. CT findings in patients with ALCD may include diverticulosis with associated colon wall thickening, fat stranding, phlegmon, extraluminal gas, abscess formation or intra-abdominal diffuse fluid. CT imaging can go beyond accurate diagnosis of ALCD; CT criteria may be also used to determine the grade of severity and may drive treatment planning of patients. US is a real-time dynamic examination with wide availability and easy accessibility and may be useful in diagnosing and managing critically ill patients who cannot be moved to CT. Its limitations include operator-dependency, poor assessment in obese patients, difficulty in the detection of free air and deeply located abscesses.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported diagnostic accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and diagnostic modalities in patients with suspected diverticulitis was published in 2014. Summary sensitivity estimates for US were 90% (95% CI: 76–98%) versus 95% (95% CI: 91–97%) for CT (p = 0.86). Summary specificity estimates for US were 90% (95% CI: 86–94%) versus 96% (95% CI: 90–100%) for CT (p = 0.04).

Although CT is the most sensitive imaging investigation for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis, a step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US, has been proposed as safe and alternative approach for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging, which is not constrained by the operator dependency limitation of ultrasound, until now is difficult to perform at the emergency department.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^8bc30361]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^36e635a6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Role of CT imaging in acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — population, intervention, and clinical management outcomes: Patient population is adults with suspected or known diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, and interventions evaluated are CT scan with or without IV, oral, or rectal contrast vs. no CT scanning. Abdominal CT scan may be associated with appropriate management of adults with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (Certainty of evidence LOW). Falsely normal or abnormal findings on abdominal CT scan resulting in inappropriate management (poor clinical sequelae) may be rare in adults with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, although the included studies did not report patient outcomes associated with misdiagnosis (Certainty of evidence LOW). In adults with suspected acute diverticulitis, abdominal CT scan may commonly detect incidental findings (findings not related to diverticulitis), but the clinical significance of the incidental findings is unclear (Certainty of evidence LOW).

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^9f6892a0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the most appropriate diagnostic tool to confirm suspected left colonic diverticulitis. However, the utility of CT imaging goes beyond accurate diagnosis of diverticulitis; the grade of severity on CT imaging may drive treatment planning of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis. The appropriate management of left colon acute diverticulitis remains still debated because of the vast spectrum of clinical presentations and different approaches to treatment proposed. The authors present a new simple classification system based on both CT scan results driving decisions making management of acute diverticulitis that may be universally accepted for day to day practice.

### Sialadenitis: a possible early manifestation of COVID-19 [^907c8b65]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute sialadenitis may be caused by viruses, including coronaviruses. Although there are anecdotal reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) salivary gland infections, there have been no well-documented cases of sialadenitis in patients with COVID-19 described in the literature. We report a case of parotitis and submandibular gland sialadenitis, as well as an isolated case of parotitis, in two patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated parotid and submandibular gland enlargement with heterogenous enhancement and attenuation, consistent with sialadenitis. Medical management was sufficient for successful resolution of the acute sialadenitis. Laryngoscope, 130:2595–2597, 2020.

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — clinician implications: Table 1 provides categories (strong recommendation, recommendation, option, and no recommendation) with explicit practice implications. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

### Salivary gland disorders [^d6272a1b]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Salivary gland disorders include inflammatory, bacterial, viral, and neoplastic etiologies. The presentation can be acute, recurrent, or chronic. Acute suppurative sialadenitis presents as rapid-onset pain and swelling and is treated with antibiotics, salivary massage, hydration, and sialagogues such as lemon drops or vitamin C lozenges. Viral etiologies include mumps and human immunodeficiency virus, and treatment is directed at the underlying disease. Recurrent or chronic sialadenitis is more likely to be inflammatory than infectious; examples include recurrent parotitis of childhood and sialolithiasis. Inflammation is commonly caused by an obstruction such as a stone or duct stricture. Management is directed at relieving the obstruction. Benign and malignant tumors can occur in the salivary glands and usually present as a painless solitary neck mass. Diagnosis is made by imaging (e.g., ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and biopsy (initially with fine-needle aspiration). Overall, most salivary gland tumors are benign and can be treated with surgical excision.

### Diagnosis and management of parotitis… [^2a259943]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. Infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. Assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. Viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza A and parainfluenza viruses. Acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and, rarely, gram-negative bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptostreptococcus species and Bacteroides species, and pigmented Porphyromonas species and Prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. β-Lactamase–producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients.

Predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms, immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. Pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. Initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. Surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. This may prevent complications and facilitate recovery. Brook I. Diagnosis and Management of Parotitis.

Although sore throat is a very common complaint in the emergency department and is often associated with benign conditions, such as pharyngitis, it can be the early onset of something much more serious and even life threatening. A thorough history and examination are vital to the correct diagnosis but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose less common but serious pathology, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Airway management is paramount to survival, and aggressive means should be taken early when epiglottitis is considered.

### Clinical strategies for the management of acute mastoiditis in the pediatric population [^4a60a3a3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of acute mastoiditis has been substantially reduced since the introduction of antibiotic therapy, mastoiditis complications are still commonly seen in the pediatric population. Many of these cases require lengthy hospitalizations and extensive medical and surgical interventions. Accordingly, a safe, effective, and resourceful diagnostic and therapeutic plan must be executed for the workup and treatment of each patient suspected of having acute mastoiditis. With thorough clinical evaluations, early diagnosis, and close follow-up, a large proportion of children with severe acute otitis media or early stage mastoiditis can be managed in the primary care setting without immediate surgical specialty involvement. This review presents an overview of the anatomical and pathophysiological considerations in acute mastoiditis and offers pediatricians a practical, evidence-based algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^a65f1e62]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^b0d870f4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Mumps: an emergency medicine-focused update [^3a0040c6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus. This disease was rampant prior to introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, resulting in decreased incidence. This disease has demonstrated several outbreaks.

Objective

This review provides a focused evaluation of mumps, an update on outbreaks, management recommendations, and ways to decrease transmission.

Discussion

Clusters of mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The virus is a paramyxovirus, a single-stranded RNA virus. The vaccine can provide lifelong immunity if administered properly, though prior to 1967 and introduction of the vaccine, the virus was common. In the past decade, there have been several notable outbreaks. Humans are the only known hosts, with disease spread through exposure to droplets and saliva. Factors affecting transmission include age, compromised immunity, time of year, travel, and vaccination status. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and headache are common, with unilateral or bilateral parotitis, and the virus may spread to other systems. Diagnosis is clinical, though polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin testing are available. This review provides several recommendations for vaccine in pregnancy, patients living in close quarters, health care personnel, and those immunocompromised. Treatment is generally supportive, with emphasis on proper isolation to prevent widespread outbreaks. Although reporting regulations and procedures vary by state, mumps is reportable in most states.

Conclusions

Mumps is an easily spread virus. Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent transmission, early recognition of the disease is crucial. As an emergency physician, it is important to recognize the clinical presentation, recommended testing, treatment, and isolation procedures.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^519f42ab]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What are the optimal methods in diagnosing IAI that balances benefits and risks?

Statement 2

Early clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosing IAIs. It helps to optimize diagnostic testing and can result in earlier implementation of a proper management plan (Recommendation 1C).

Statement 3

A step-up approach for diagnosis should be used and tailored to the clinical setting, resources, patient's age beginning with clinical and laboratory examination and progressing to imaging examinations (Recommendation 1C).

Diagnosis of complicated IAIs is mainly clinical. Early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications of IAIs.

Patients with IAIs typically present with rapid-onset abdominal pain and signs of local and systemic inflammation (pain, tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and/or tachypnea). Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as oliguria, acute alteration of mental status, and lactic acidosis are indicative of ongoing organ failure.

Physical evaluation may limit the differential diagnosis to direct decisions regarding a proper management plan including the need for appropriate diagnostic testing, the need for initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and whether emergent intervention is required.

The value of physical findings in the diagnostic work-up for IAIs has been studied in relation to acute appendicitis where signs and symptoms are helpful in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis.

The presence of a positive psoas sign, fever, or migratory pain to the right lower quadrant suggests an increased likelihood of appendicitis. Conversely, the presence of vomiting before pain makes appendicitis unlikely.

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been used over the last two decades to complete the clinical assessment of patients with IAIs. Although CT has higher sensitivity and specificity, concerns about radiation exposure have recently prompted reappraisal of the roles of sonography including performance by surgeons.

### Juvenile idiopathic recurrent parotitis (JIRP) treated with short course steroids, a case series study and one decade follow up for potential autoimmune disorder [^33597a61]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Juvenile idiopathic recurrent parotitis (JIRP) in children is a condition characterized with recurrent episodes of idiopathic non-obstructive, non-suppurative parotid gland inflammation during childhood. It usually manifests with pain, swelling and fever of less than 1 week duration and are separated by asymptomatic periods.

Although the exact incidence is not clear, it is known as uncommon clinical condition [, and]. JIRP was the second most frequent disease of the parotid gland in children before the program of mumps vaccine.

It presents with a male preponderance, mostly unilateral and usually occur between 3 and 6 years, and tends to resolve during puberty in most patients.

The diagnosis of JIRP is mainly based on history and physical examination with ≥ 2 attacks of acute parotitis. Preliminary diagnosis is frequently confirmed by ultrasonography (US) after excluding other possible causes, such as ductal malformation, sialoliths, acute infectious parotitis, tumors and systemic allergic or autoimmune disorders.

Its etiology is not fully understood. It is believed that multifactorial parameters are involved in pathophysiology of JIRP. One possible explanation is reduced flow or modified content of saliva which induces stasis, and recruitment of inflammation. Some researchers suggest structural anomaly of the ducts as the main trigger for secondary inflammation. Furthermore, viral and bacterial infections, malocclusion, autoimmune diseases (e.g. Sjogren and sarcoidosis), and immune disorders such as selective Ig A deficiency have been reported as accompanying diseases.

The treatment of JIRP generally consists of relief of acute symptoms. First step measures are maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, warm massage to the parotid gland, and use of analgesics. The administration of antibiotics during attacks is controversial. More recently, increasing evidence indicate success of sialendoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of JIRP.

Since there are no definitive guidelines for diagnosis and management of this condition and patients may be undergo unnecessary and potentially invasive procedures, we determined to present a consecutive case series of patients with more than one decade follow up and we evaluated their response to short course treatments by prednisolone, additionally we reviewed current modality of diagnosis and therapy.

### Parotitis-like symptoms associated with COVID-19, France, March-April 2020 [^0393010c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The 3 patients received 10–14 days of paracetamol (1 g 3–4×/d) for their COVID-19. The parotitis resolved over the next few days after diagnosis. The 3 patients had persistent loss of smell after the resolution of their general and parotitis-like symptoms.

The occurrence of acute parotitis related to COVID-19 has been suggested in a recent case report, corroborating the clinical observations of otolaryngologists. Our findings support the hypothesis that the parotitis-like symptoms might be attributable to intraparotid lymph node enlargement, which is different from a primary parotitis.

Infection with rubella, herpes, influenza, and human immunodeficiency viruses can result in salivary tropism, leading to diffuse parotitis. Our MRI findings mainly report diffuse enlargement of the gland without evidence of multiple intraglandular lymph nodes; however, the literature remains limited because the diagnosis is clinical and MRI is not often required. Mumps-related parotitis usually occurs in children and might be bilateral. In a patient with HIV infection, the parotid lesions appear as multiple and bilateral parotid lymphoepithelial cysts, which are bigger than lymph nodes. Moreover, cysts have T1 (hypo) and T2 (hyper) signals that are similar than those of the cerebrospinal fluid. In our patients, the MRI results did not indicate cysts.

The features we describe support the diagnosis of adenitis, which might impair the gland functioning. The adenitis and the parotid-related enlargement might block the main gland duct (Stenon's duct), leading to saliva retention and parotid tissue inflammation. The lack of saliva might be associated with sticky saliva and taste impairment. Intraparotid adenitis differs from primary diffuse parotitis, which was recently reported in an unique case of COVID-19.

Sanitation conditions and the difficulties in performing additional salivary gland examinations (e.g. sialography or MRI) complicate the characterization of parotitis. Thus, the main limitation of our report is the lack of functional examinations of the parotid during the clinical course of the disease. The assessment of the functioning of the saliva secretion and the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) in the saliva could provide further information about SARS-CoV-2 transmission through saliva.

### Buccal space malignancy in the setting of chronic sialadenitis: a report of 2 cases [^54d70f0d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

We report the cases of an 89-year-old woman and a 77-year-old woman with long-standing chronic sialadenitis (60 and 10 years, respectively) who were referred to our large academic medical center for sialendoscopy. Both patients presented with symptoms of acute parotid duct obstruction in the background of long-standing parotid duct disease. Imaging demonstrated ductal dilation and periductal inflammation and, along with the clinical findings, was supportive of a diagnosis of acute parotitis in the setting of chronic obstructive parotid disease. Both patients underwent sialendoscopy. Intraoperative findings suggested the presence of a mass lesion in both cases, and biopsy confirmed a buccal space malignancy in each. Although benign processes such as ductal strictures and sialolithiasis are frequent causes of parotid duct system complaints, the possibility of a malignancy should be entertained and ruled out. Even in patients who have long-standing obstructive parotid symptoms, malignancy can be encountered as a new diagnosis. We discuss the unique presentation, workup, and management of our 2 patients, and we briefly review the current literature.

### Parotitis and sialendoscopy of the parotid gland [^58183dbd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Nonneoplastic disorders of the salivary glands involve inflammatory processes. These disorders have been managed conservatively with antibiotics, warm compresses, massage, sialogogues, and adequate hydration. Up to 40% of patients may have an inadequate response or persistent symptoms. When conservative techniques fail, the next step is operative intervention. Sialendoscopy offers a minimally invasive option for the diagnosis and management of chronic inflammatory disorders of the salivary glands and offers the option of gland and function preservation. In this article, we review some of the more common nonneoplastic disorders of the parotid gland, indications for diagnostic and interventional sialendoscopy, and operative techniques.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^c0975a90]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of left-sided colonic diverticulitis [^357da5c1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — Alternative imaging when CT is unavailable or contraindicated: Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful alternatives in the initial evaluation of suspected acute diverticulitis when CT is not available or is contraindicated (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). They may be useful in patients with a contrast allergy or in pregnant patients; ultrasound can be particularly useful to rule out other causes of pelvic pain when the diagnosis is unclear, especially in women, but ultrasound can miss complicated diverticulitis and thus should not typically be the only imaging modality if this is suspected. Ultrasound is user dependent with limited utility in obese patients, and where available, MRI may be better than CT at differentiating neoplasia from diverticulitis.

### Recurrent parotitis as a presentation of primary pediatric Sjögren syndrome [^9dd4e79b]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Parotitis is a common condition seen in the pediatric population, usually as an isolated occurrence associated with viral or bacterial infection. The differential diagnosis expands when recurrent parotitis is encountered. One etiology is primary pediatric Sjögren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune condition typically associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth in adults. Pediatric patients often present with isolated recurrent bilateral parotitis, however, and we describe 4 such cases in children aged 9 to 17 years at presentation. Despite lack of ocular complaints, 3 of these patients had ocular findings on ophthalmologic exam. Our patients also exhibited classic laboratory abnormalities, including positive antinuclear antibody, SS A, and SS B antibodies; presence of rheumatoid factor; and hypergammaglobulinemia. Consideration of SS in the child with recurrent parotitis is important for timely and appropriate referral and treatment. We review the differential diagnosis of parotitis in children as well as the salient features of pediatric SS.

Values and preferences — diverticulitis follow-up and recurrence management: No systematic reviews were identified assessing patient values and preferences for follow-up colonoscopy or for treatments after recurrence; a survey analyzed responses from 133 adult patients treated for uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis with conservative management or elective surgery between 2014 and 2019 and found that shared decision making, well-formulated values, and feeling informed and supported were associated with lower treatment choice regret and greater satisfaction, although the study had a high risk of response bias (14%). Feedback from the CGC Public Panel showed a preference for follow-up colonoscopy after initial treatment of acute complicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis and an even stronger preference for management of postacute left-sided colonic diverticulitis without mesalamine, with no trend observed for preferences regarding planned elective surgery versus conservative treatment or observation.

### Pediatric sialadenitis [^9670ebac]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Sialadenitis in the pediatric population accounts for up to 10% of all salivary gland disease. Viral parotitis and juvenile recurrent parotitis are the two most common causes. Multiple factors, independently or in combination, can result in acute, chronic, or recurrent acute salivary gland inflammation. Sialendoscopy has emerged as the leading diagnostic technique and intervention for pediatric sialadenitis. Sialendoscopy is a safe and effective gland-preserving treatment of pediatric sialadenitis. Investigational studies are needed to address the impact of steroid instillation, postoperative stenting, and long-term outcomes of pediatric sialendoscopy. This article presents a comprehensive review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sialadenitis.

### Influenza-associated parotitis during the 2014–2015 influenza season in the United States [^27c21661]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

During the 2014–2015 influenza season in the United States, 256 cases of influenza-associated parotitis were reported from 27 states. We conducted a case-control study and laboratory investigation to further describe this rare clinical manifestation of influenza.

Methods

During February 2015-April 2015, we interviewed 50 cases (with parotitis) and 124 ill controls (without parotitis) with laboratory-confirmed influenza; participants resided in 11 states and were matched by age, state, hospital admission status, and specimen collection date. Influenza viruses were characterized using real-time polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing. We compared cases and controls using conditional logistic regression. Specimens from additional reported cases were also analyzed.

Results

Cases, 73% of whom were aged < 20 years, experienced painful (86%), unilateral (68%) parotitis a median of 4 (range, 0–16) days after onset of systemic or respiratory symptoms. Cases were more likely than controls to be male (76% vs 51%; P = 0.005). We detected influenza A(H3N2) viruses, genetic group 3C.2a, in 100% (32/32) of case and 92% (105/108) of control specimens sequenced (P = 0.22). Influenza B and A(H3N2) 3C.3 and 3C.3b genetic group virus infections were detected in specimens from additional cases.

Conclusions

Influenza-associated parotitis, as reported here and in prior sporadic case reports, seems to occur primarily with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection. Because of the different clinical and infection control considerations for mumps and influenza virus infections, we recommend clinicians consider influenza in the differential diagnoses among patients with acute parotitis during the influenza season.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

Palliative Care

When should palliative care be involved to support individuals with PLAN and their families?

Individuals with infantile PLAN have a shortened life expectancy, typically living until late childhood. Clinicians should be transparent with families about the prognosis. It is important for the child's consistent provider(s) to discuss end of life care with families ideally before a time of crisis or hospitalization. Providers must be sensitive to the family's culture and experiences, using a shared decision-making approach to formulate a plan that aligns with the child's/family's values. Providers should give guidance. For example, it is appropriate to recommend no chest compressions nor intubation for a child nearing the end of their life. Although difficult, establishing an end-of-life care plan (preferred location of death, interventions and procedures not indicated, and code status) will help ensure that the child's and family's wishes are respected, and that the child is not subjected to harmful interventions. Involvement of a pediatric palliative care team or expert early after diagnosis is recommended to help facilitate these conversations support families. These teams often involve a physician, nurse, case manager, social worker and spiritual care advisor. Hospice care can provide valuable support as the child nears the end of life.

Even with careful planning, sometimes difficult decisions must be made during a hospitalization. The care team should be fully informed about PLAN. A useful question, as suggested by the "AAP Guidance for End of Life Care," is to ask, "Are we doing this to the child or for the child?" In the words of one parent,

A parent does not want to be in the ICU trying to come to terms, unprepared, with how to proceed when a child is so ill, and you have specialists of every sort involved in just keeping the patient's vital signs going. When is it time to let go? Here is where social workers, hospice/palliative care team and chaplains are essential. There is a point at which continued medical intervention seems pointless and even cruel. Parents need to plan in advance and should be strongly encouraged by the medical team to do so.

Life expectancy in juvenile PLAN and adult PLAN is less clear from the literature, and palliative care may be appropriate for some individuals. Children and adults should be included in the discussions about their prognosis at a level appropriate to the individual. The American Academy of Pediatrics provides in-depth and practical guidelines applicable for children with PLAN.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^513a65d9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

After the publication of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting for the diagnosis and management of ALCD in the general population, the present guidelines represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical guidelines for diagnosis and management of ALCD in elderly patients (> 65 years of age).

During the 1° Pisa Workshop of Acute Care & Trauma Surgery held in Pisa (Italy) in September 2019 with the collaboration of WSES, SICG, ACOI, SICUT, AcEMC and SIFIPAC, a panel of experts participated in a Consensus Conference where three panel-members presented a number of statements, which were developed for each of the four topics regarding the diagnosis and management of ALCD in elderly patients, formulated according to the GRADE system: Diagnosis, Management, Surgical Technique, Antibiotic Therapy. The statements were then voted (Fig. 2), eventually modified and finally approved by the participants to The Consensus Conference (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of recommendations

After reaching consensus on each of the above-mentioned statements, the Scientific Committee members developed the following algorithm for the diagnosis and management of ALCD in Elderly Patient, reported in Fig. 3.

Management algorithm for patients older than 65 years with suspected AD

Unfortunately, due to the lack of high-quality studies focusing on elderly patients and to the heterogeneity of the existing studies in the definition of an age cut-off for the characterization of elderly patient, according to the GRADE methodology, all statements are based on low- or very low-quality evidence.

### Emergency imaging assessment of acute, nontraumatic conditions of the head and neck [^5009558b]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Patients often present to the emergency department with a wide variety of nontraumatic infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions of the head and neck. Because the use of cervical and neck computed tomography (CT) has become routine in the emergency setting, knowledge of the imaging findings of common acute conditions of the head and neck is essential to ensure an accurate diagnosis of these potentially life-threatening conditions, which include oral cavity infections, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess, sialadenitis, parotiditis, diskitis, thrombophlebitis, periorbital and orbital cellulitis, infectious cervical lymphadenopathy, and various neoplasms. Less common conditions that require rapid diagnosis and treatment include epiglottitis, invasive fungal sinusitis, angioedema, and deep neck abscess. Familiarity with these conditions enables the radiologist to make a prompt diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, and evaluate for potential complications. CT is the first-line imaging modality in the emergency setting; however, magnetic resonance imaging plays an important secondary role.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d17d69c6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Colonoscopy after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — The systematic review identified 19 studies addressing the use of follow-up colonoscopy to assess the presence of colonic neoplasia after an episode of presumed acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis. Two observational studies compared follow-up colonoscopy with no colonoscopy, 2 observational studies compared follow-up colonoscopy in patients with recent acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis versus healthy controls, 1 RCT compared early (in-hospital) colonoscopy with later colonoscopy, 1 observational study compared colonoscopy with flexible sigmoidoscopy, and 13 were noncomparative studies of patients who had colonoscopy. Studies included middle-aged adults with mostly acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis who did not have colonoscopy within 1 to 2 years before the acute episode. Among critical outcomes, low-certainty evidence from comparative studies showed that CRC diagnoses at 1 or 2 years of follow-up may not differ between patients with left-sided colonic diverticulitis who did or did not have colonoscopy after an acute episode within about 2 to 12 months (odds ratio [OR], 1.77 [95% CI, 0.79 to 3.99]). The identified CRC cases and high-risk colonic neoplasia in the included studies occurred mostly in patients with complicated diverticulitis, and evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) to determine whether patients with recent acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis had a higher prevalence of CRC on colonoscopy than healthy controls.

### Parotitis-like symptoms associated with COVID-19, France, March-April 2020 [^ca0615b0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Future studies are needed to characterize the parotid manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Although the findings of this study support the hypothesis that intraparotid lymphadenitis is a causal factor, the direct spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the parotid tissue might be theoretically possible regarding the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (the virus receptor) in the parotid tissue and the potential risk for excretion of virions through the saliva.

In conclusion, parotid inflammation might be encountered in COVID-19 patients and could be related to intraparotid lymphadenitis. Even in persons vaccinated against mumps, testing for viruses that cause a parotitis-like illness is important, including rubella virus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. Additional studies to characterize parotid manifestations in COVID-19 patients will help determine diagnosis and treatment.

Parotid gland anomalies

Parotitis

Parotitis is defined as inflammation of the parotid gland, which may have various causes, including infectious (viral or bacterial), autoimmune, lithiasic or idiopathic causes. Infectious sialadenitis is more common in parotid than other salivary glands. In contrast, sialolithiasis is much rarer in parotid than in submandibular glands and has no specific imaging appearance.

Acute viral parotitis

Acute viral parotitis is more common than bacterial parotitis and is frequently bilateral (90% of cases) but not always synchronously. The main viruses are paramyxovirus (mumps, whose incidence has greatly reduced due to vaccination), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza and HIV. Clinical signs are painful swelling of the parotid gland, fever and inflammation of the orifice of Stensen's duct. Occasionally, the submandibular and sublingual glands are also affected. Imaging is not needed for the diagnosis. When performed, ultrasonography shows a glandular enlargement with foci of salivary secretions, lymph nodes and increased vascularization (Fig. 3). Spontaneous regression in a few days is the rule.

Fig. 3

The special case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Note that HIV children prevalence rate is low, in western countries. Indeed, if the estimated 1.72 million children under 15 years of age are living with HIV, 89 per cent live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition to causing acute parotitis, HIV infection may cause persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (including intraparotid lymph nodes), lympho-epithelial cysts and benign lympho-epithelial lesions. These lesions occur early in the course of the retroviral infection and consist of lymphocytic infiltration, intraductal epithelial proliferation and atrophy of salivary acini. Sonography and MRI reveal a diffuse glandular enlargement, multiple thin-wall cysts of variable size and/or multiple solid masses and cervical lymphadenopathies (Fig. 4). These lesions may also be present in disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis. With HIV infection, there is also increased risk of malignant lymphoma.

### Down in the mumps [^69aa376c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A 10-week-old female infant presented with a right-sided facial swelling without any constitutional symptoms. The swelling was nontender, nonfluctuant, with no erythema or induration. On the basis of the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging findings and serology, a diagnosis of unilateral mumps parotitis was made. The United Kingdom is currently experiencing a mumps epidemic with a 28-fold rise in the number of cases over the last 10 years. Infants are being increasingly affected. Mumps parotitis, which was previously unreported in infants, needs to be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when a small child presents with swelling of the parotid gland.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^288757c4]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Executive summary

This guidance document is intended for health professionals who see patients who have gastrointestinal issues during and after treatment for cancer which could be affecting their quality of life or potentially interfering with the effective delivery of their treatment for cancer. In a rapidly evolving area, it also touches on future perspectives. There is little definitive evidence so recommendations are largely based on expert opinion. Areas addressed and key points include:

Patient perspectives

All patients should be informed about possible future side effects and how to access appropriate help at the end of their cancer treatment using a personalised care and support plan.
Continued holistic assessment is recommended in all patients before and after treatment for cancer to ensure understanding of the ongoing issues.
All clinicians seeing patients after cancer therapies have responsibility for identifying unmet needs, listening to their concerns and signposting patients to appropriate services.

Pathophysiology: overview

Optimal symptom management requires the identification of the physiological deficits which have developed as a result of cancer treatment, with appropriate testing.
The majority of patients developing GI symptoms after cancer treatment have more than one cause for their symptoms.

GI symptoms and patient-centred assessment

Clinicians are encouraged to use validated symptom questionnaires (eg, the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale) or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), routinely completed by the patients when they attend clinics to help ensure accurate comprehensive assessment.
In those patients who underwent curatively intended treatment pathways, recurrence needs to be considered and ruled out.
Investigations for conditions not associated with the cancer or its treatment need to be considered.

Diagnostic tests

Clinical acumen, specific individual symptoms or patterns of symptoms are not reliable in diagnosing the underlying cause(s) for those symptoms in patients treated for cancer. Therefore, comprehensive investigation is required at an early stage if troublesome symptoms do not respond fully to simple, empirical intervention.
A wide variety of cancer treatments cause the same treatable physiological changes, which frequently include bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), carbohydrate intolerance, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and after immunosuppressive treatment, bacterial or viral infection.
Investigating acutely during chemotherapy/radiotherapy in symptomatic patients is feasible and beneficial if symptoms are impacting on treatment.
With ongoing or severe toxicity, early advice from a gastroenterologist, ideally with an interest in managing side effects of cancer treatment, should be sought.

### Parotitis-like symptoms associated with COVID-19, France, March-April 2020 [^d5325a70]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with the emergence of many clinical pictures of the disease. Patients might have nose and throat symptoms, such as loss of smell and taste. Many otolaryngologists have observed an increase in the number of patients with acute parotitis (inflammation of the parotid salivary glands), which could be related to COVID-19. We report the clinical features of 3 outpatients who sought care at Foch Hospital (Paris, France) for parotitis-like symptoms in the context of COVID-19.

Three women sought care at the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery of Foch Hospital for unilateral ear pain and retromandibular edema. The patients also reported general and otolaryngologic symptoms, including anorexia, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, fatigue, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, sore throat, face pain, and loss of smell and taste (Table). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The patients had no notable medical histories, and they were all vaccinated against mumps. The parotitis-like symptoms occurred at the onset of the disease in 2 patients and over the clinical course of the disease in the remaining patient. A clinical diagnosis of parotitis was made in all 3 cases. The otolaryngologist did not see any pus draining from the parotid duct.

Table
Demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics of 3 patients who sought care for parotitis-like symptoms associated with coronavirus disease, Paris, France, March–April 2020*

*Diagnoses were made in Foch Hospital (Paris, France) on the following dates: March 21 (patient 1), March 27 (patient 2), and April 2 (patient 3). ENT, ear, nose, and throat; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which indicated intraparotid lymphadenitis. In all three cases, we observed multiple unilateral or bilateral intraglandular lymph nodes in the deep and surface layers, in a relatively normal-sized gland. We preserved the lymph node architecture by using a preserved fatty hilum. We observed no juxtaglandular fat infiltration or thickening of the fascia. We also observed no intraglandular linear bands or cysts on the MRI (Appendix).

Side effects of RAI therapy include nausea, temporary or permanent salivary gland and lacrimal duct dysfunction, sialadenitis, parotitis, thyroiditis, and bone marrow and gonadal dysfunction. Adequate hydration might help alleviate symptoms. There is also a risk of second primary cancer of soft tissue, salivary gland, colon, and blood, associated with higher cumulative doses. Less than 10% of DTC patients will develop metastatic disease. Of these, approximately one in three experience complete remission after RAI therapy. The ATA recommends a whole body scan with or without single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) to determine RAI avidity for residual structural disease after therapy. Response is most commonly determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). For patients with structural progression within 12–16 months after adequate therapy, subsequent treatment with RAI is unlikely to be effective. A 2018 retrospective study showed no clear benefit of a second round of RAI treatment in DTC patients with biochemically or structurally incomplete response. More studies are needed to explore other potential indications for RAI therapy. The ESTIMABL2 [identifier: NCT01837745] and IoN [identifier: NCT01398085] randomized clinical trials investigating the role of RAI ablation versus no RAI ablation in low risk DTC are currently ongoing.

### Notes from the field: complications of mumps during a university outbreak among students who had received 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine-Iowa, July 2015-may 2016 [^2a94b857]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Patient B

On October 13, 2015, a woman aged 21 years developed progressive right ear pain, cough, and shortness of breath. Two days later, she was treated in a hospital emergency department where she received a diagnosis of right otitis externa and left otitis media, for which she was prescribed amoxicillin and analgesics. Later that day, she went to the University of Iowa Student Health Center because of worsening respiratory symptoms. During that encounter, she was also noted to have right bullous myringitis (purulent inflammation of the tympanic membrane), right parotitis suspected to be mumps, and suspected pneumonia. Azithromycin was prescribed empirically to treat both the bullous myringitis and atypical pulmonary pathogens. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for mumps was performed on a buccal swab specimen and was negative. However, her symptoms and epidemiologic link to the outbreak met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition for a probable case of mumps. One day later, she noticed tinnitus and diminished hearing in her right ear; on day 8, she had audiology testing and was evaluated by an otolaryngologist, at which time she received a diagnosis of moderate right sensorineural hearing loss, attributed to mumps, and conductive hearing loss, attributed to otitis media and myringitis. She was treated for 1 week with prednisone, and all her symptoms resolved by the thirteenth day after onset of parotitis. No repeat audiology testing was performed.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^4728cf58]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) characterization — nonsyndromic, observable criteria and diagnostic emphasis are specified as follows: "The characterization should be nonsyndromic and include directly observable physical examination or radiographic features, rather than including associated patient- or clinician-reported symptoms (eg, pain) [objective]." It also states that "The characterization should be sufficiently broad to be integrated within both Panel-derived and independent severity scales and staging systems [flexible]" and "The characterization should be sufficiently descriptive as to encompass disease states reasonably attributable as ORN across human- and machine-interpretable nomenclatures and/or ontologies [scalable and interoperable]," and "The characterization should be based on meeting one or more of the listed criteria, rather than a diagnosis of exclusion (eg, "non-septic and unrelated to synchronous malignancy") [affirmative]." Panel consensus "was a consensus to place emphasis on clinical signs and symptoms in conjunction with radiographic findings as a practical approach in diagnosing ORN," with the characterization "rooted on post-RT consequential injury that centers around observable loss of bone and periosteal integrity" and defined "toward ORN as a distinct clinical condition, without using a time factor or duration, nor incorporating "syndromic" definitions by requiring the presence or absence of commonly associated signs (eg, mucosal ulceration, or frank mandible fracture) or frequently noted consequential symptoms (ie, the presence or absence of associated pain or trismus)." Figure 1 illustrates subtle clinical presentation and aided visualization: "Fistula present in edentulous anterior left mandible (arrow), without using a dental instrument probe. The lesion is subtle in clinical presentation. (B) The same fistulous lesion seen in (A), using a dental instrument probe to facilitate clinical visualization."

### Updated recommendations for isolation of persons with mumps [^537c65ad]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Mumps, an acute vaccine-preventable viral illness transmitted by respiratory droplets and saliva, has an incubation period most commonly of 16–18 days. The classic clinical presentation of mumps is parotitis, which can be preceded by several days of nonspecific prodromal symptoms; however, mumps also can be asymptomatic, especially in young children. Mumps transmission can occur from persons with subclinical or clinical infections and during the prodromal or symptomatic phases of illness. In 2006, during a mumps resurgence in the United States, the latest national recommendations from CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stipulated that persons with mumps be maintained in isolation with standard precautions and droplet precautions for 9 days after onset of parotitis. However, the existence of conflicting guidance (i.e., that the infectious period of mumps extended through the fourth day after parotitis onset) led to confusion regarding the appropriate length of isolation. In addition, during the 2006 resurgence, compliance with recommendations for isolation in university settings was substantially lower for 9 days (65%) compared with 4–5 days (86%). In 2007, after a review of the evidence supporting the 9-day isolation guidance by AAP and CDC, AAP changed its isolation guidance for health-care workers in ambulatory settings from 9 days to 5 days. In February 2008, after review of data on mumps in health-care settings, mumps viral load, and mumps virus isolation, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) approved changes in its recommendations related to mumps in in-patient settings. As a result, CDC, AAP, and HICPAC all now recommend a 5-day period after onset of parotitis, both for isolation of persons with mumps in either community or health-care settings and for use of standard precautions and droplet precautions. This report summarizes the scientific basis for these changes in mumps isolation guidance.

### Determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis severity: an international multidisciplinary consultation [^f019750c]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis severity" for acute pancreatitis.

The Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity is a clinical tool designed for stratifying the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients. This classification system aids in predicting the clinical course and outcomes, thereby guiding appropriate management strategies.

The primary components of this classification system are the presence and nature of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis and the presence and duration of organ failure. The necrosis can be absent, sterile, or infected, while organ failure can be absent, transient (lasting less than or equal to 48 hours), or persistent (lasting more than 48 hours).

The severity of acute pancreatitis is determined based on these components. A patient is classified as having mild AP if there is no necrosis and no organ failure. Moderate AP is diagnosed if sterile necrosis or transient organ failure is present. Severe AP is indicated by the presence of infected necrosis or persistent organ failure. Lastly, critical AP is diagnosed if both infected necrosis and persistent organ failure are present.

This classification system provides a comprehensive and nuanced approach to assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis, allowing for more precise prognostication and management of this potentially life-threatening condition.

The determinant-based classification system assesses the severity of acute pancreatitis by evaluating two critical factors: the status of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis and the degree of organ failure. This method assists in categorizing the condition into various severity levels to aid in treatment planning.

Inputs required for this classification are as follows:

- **Pancreatic / Peripancreatic Necrosis**:
- Absent
- Sterile
- Infected
- **Organ Failure**:
- Absent
- Transient (≤ 48 hours)
- Persistent (> 48 hours)

The classification process uses these inputs to assign the patient's condition into one of four possible categories:

1. **Mild Acute Pancreatitis (AP)** is determined if:

- Pancreatic / peripancreatic necrosis is 'Absent'
- And organ failure is 'Absent'

2. **Moderate Acute Pancreatitis (AP)** is assessed if:

- Pancreatic / peripancreatic necrosis is 'Sterile'
- Or organ failure is 'Transient (≤ 48 hours)'

3. **Severe Acute Pancreatitis (AP)** classification applies when:

- Pancreatic / peripancreatic necrosis is 'Infected'
- Or organ failure is 'Persistent (> 48 hours)'

4. **Critical Acute Pancreatitis (AP)** is the classification if both:

- Pancreatic / peripancreatic necrosis is 'Infected'
- And organ failure is 'Persistent (> 48 hours)'

Through this evaluation, health professionals can systematically determine the severity category, which provides a scientific basis for determining the urgency and type of intervention required. The method ensures a structured and reliable assessment of acute pancreatitis, supporting optimal patient management.

### Salivary gland disorders: rapid evidence review [^4644d078]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The major salivary glands are the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Salivary gland disorders can affect the glandular tissue or its excretory system. The parotid glands are the largest and produce aqueous serous secretions that are less immunogenic. They are more susceptible to infections and neoplasms. The submandibular glands produce mucinous secretions that are high in calcium and phosphate salts through a long submandibular duct that flows against gravity. The submandibular glands are responsible for more than 80% of salivary stones. Sialadenitis can be acute or chronic and caused by bacterial, viral, and obstructive etiologies; the most common bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus. The most common viral etiologies in children are mumps (globally) and juvenile recurrent parotitis (in vaccinated populations). Sialadenosis is a chronic asymptomatic enlargement of the salivary glands due to systemic disease. Sialolithiasis causes up to 50% of salivary gland disorders. It is associated with salivary stasis and inflammation caused by dehydration, malnutrition, medications, or chronic illness. Obstruction is also caused by trauma, stenosis, and mucoceles. Neoplasms are rare and typically benign, but they warrant referral and imaging with ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance sialography. Most disorders are managed with conservative measures by treating the underlying etiology, optimizing predisposing factors, controlling pain, and increasing salivary flow with sialagogues, hydration, massage, warm compresses, oral hygiene, and medication adjustment. Sialendoscopy is a gland-sparing technique that can treat obstructive and nonobstructive disorders. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):550–559.

### Novel multidisciplinary salivary gland society (MSGS) questionnaire: an international consensus [^7f311e2a]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Salivary gland complaints are known to have a major effect on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. In almost all cases, they comprise xerostomia and/or sialadenitis.

Xerostomia is defined as subjective oral dryness in contrast to hyposalivation, which is an objective reduction of the salivary flow. The prevalence of xerostomia in the general population varies from 8%to 13%. The range of the underlying medical conditions leading to hyposalivation is increasing. Whereas Sjögren's syndrome, xerostomia after radiation therapy, and xerogenic medication have been known for a long time, there is rising incidence of other pathologies leading to xerostomia including post radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer, juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP), IgG4‐related disease, and chronic sialadenitis caused by salivary stones or salivary strictures of unknown etiology.

Sialadenitis is defined as an infection of the salivary glands, which can be caused by strictures and/or calculus. Strictures, defined as a shrinkage of the salivary excretory ducts, are either idiopathic or induced by bacterial and/or auto‐immune diseases, and are most frequently located in the parotid glands. Salivary stones are calcified concretions of unknown etiology, most frequently located in the submandibular gland.

Xerostomia and sialadenitis are not rare conditions and can be linked together particularly in case of chronic sialadenitis, especially if they are linked to auto‐immune disorders. Symptoms experienced by patients presenting salivary gland pathologies are assessed by questionnaires that evaluate the patient's complaints and their repercussions on their QOL. As of today, over 100 questionnaires regarding xerostomia and oral pathologies are available in the literature; however, none has been validated to assesses completely both sialadenitis and xerostomia regarding any type of treatment (medical, sialendoscopic, or surgical).

### Chapter 9: mumps | Manual for the surveillance of vaccine… [^341be679]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points This chapter provides general guidance for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance, describing the disease background/epidemiology, case investigation and reporting/notification, disease case definitions, and activities for enhancing surveillance, case investigation, and outbreak control for mumps. Nonspecific prodromal symptoms may precede parotitis by several days, including low-grade fever, which may last 3–4 days, myalgia, anorexia, malaise, and headache. The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12–25 days, but parotitis typically develops 16 to 18 days after exposure to mumps virus. As a result, specimens for PCR testing should be collected within 10 days, ideally within 0–3 days, of parotitis onset. Transmission may also occur from persons with asymptomatic infections or only prodromal symptoms.

No studies have assessed peak infectiousness in mumps patients who do not have parotitis. Clinical Criteria In the absence of a more likely alternative diagnosis, an acute illness characterized by:

- Parotitis or swelling of other salivary glands of any duration, OR
- **At least one of the following mumps-related complication**:
- Orchitis
- Oophoritis
- Aseptic meningitis
- Encephalitis
- Hearing loss
- Mastitis
- Pancreatitis. Case Classifications Confirmed:

- Meets confirmatory laboratory evidence. Probable:

- Meets clinical criteria ANDepidemiologic linkage criteria, OR
- Meets supportive laboratory evidence AND
- **Meets clinical criteria of**:
- ≥ 2-day duration of parotitis or other salivary gland swelling.

OR
- a mumps-related complication AND
- ≥ 2-day duration of parotitis or other salivary gland swelling
- Does NOT meet epidemiologic linkage criteria*
- Meets clinical criteria of: Suspect:

- Meets the clinical criteria but does not meet laboratory or epidemiologic linkage criteria, OR
- Meets supportive laboratory evidence but does not meet the clinical criteria ANDhas documentation that mumps was suspected *These are considered sporadic cases.

### Post-viral olfactory loss and parosmia [^65c86e5c]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sources and selection criteria

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase using the terms "olfactory dysfunction," "anosmia," and "parosmia" for articles published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. These articles were reviewed and only those that specifically included patients with post-viral causes were included. We also reviewed reference lists from articles that we deemed to be high quality. Preference was given to randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, international consensus guidelines, and systematic reviews that have informed these guidelines. We included smaller studies if they were of particular note or if other evidence was unavailable, for example, a case series that specifically included patients with parosmia owing to other available evidence being limited. In general, case reports and small case series were excluded.
