## Question

Does a high vitamin B12 level carry clinical significance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a high serum vitamin B12 level carries clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "high" B12 is defined across labs and studies. Then, I should verify the main disease associations, especially malignancy, kidney and liver disease, and inflammation. Next, I will consider mechanistic plausibility, including haptocorrin-driven elevations. After that, I should review what major guidelines say or don't say about incidentally high B12. Then, I need to appraise the strength and limitations of the evidence. Finally, I will translate this into a pragmatic clinical approach, including excluding supplementation, targeted labs, and when to pursue imaging and cancer screening, while keeping an eye on special populations like CKD and post-bariatric patients.

> Let me first confirm the threshold question. Most clinical laboratories report an adult reference range of roughly 200–600 pmol/L for total cobalamin, and the pivotal population-based studies stratified risk beginning above the upper limit, with stronger signals above 800 pmol/L; local reference ranges vary, so I need to ensure I interpret in the context of the lab's own intervals and clinical presentation [^notfound] [^116ouNKL] [^1121hj3r] [^112TSbGP].

> I should now review the reported disease associations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — association is not causation — but the Danish registry cohort consistently found that newly detected high B12 is followed by an increased 1‑year cancer incidence that rises with the cobalamin level, with the strongest excess for hematologic and smoking‑/alcohol‑related solid tumors; SIRs were particularly high above 800 pmol/L and remained elevated early after detection [^114GbcNy] [^116ouNKL] [^115E5RUY] [^111PmCSW].

> Wait, let me verify persistence over time and by cancer type. The excess risk peaked within the first year but remained elevated thereafter for liver, pancreatic, lung, and myeloid malignancies, with some signals persisting beyond five years for hematologic cancers; stratified analyses suggested robustness across prior morbidities, though unmeasured confounding remains possible [^1121hj3r] [^114ksFri] [^113RJ78E].

> I need to check nonmalignant contexts that raise B12. CKD repeatedly shows up as a strong predictor of elevated B12 in hospitalized patients, yet physiology suggests this is not simply reduced glomerular clearance of endogenous B12; in contrast, exogenous high-dose B12 can accumulate when proximal tubular reabsorption saturates, especially in CKD, so I should confirm exposure history carefully [^114iEtru] [^117J9xr9]. Inflammatory states and liver disease also correlate with higher B12, and in older oncology cohorts, a composite B12–CRP index has been linked to short-term mortality and hospitalization risk, reinforcing the inflammation–binding protein story rather than toxicity from B12 itself [^115KzQZa] [^113XoZyb].

> Let me consider mechanisms to make sure the biology is plausible. A leading hypothesis is that tumors and inflammatory tissues increase haptocorrin, the inactive B12-binding protein, inflating total B12 while the bioactive fraction (holotranscobalamin) may be normal or low; that would make high B12 a paraneoplastic or inflammatory marker, not a direct pathogen [^112cxq29]. But wait, what if the inactive fraction has other correlates? Observational data in older adults link higher holo‑haptocorrin with neurodegeneration biomarkers such as Tau, which may reflect disease activity rather than B12 causality, so I should avoid overinterpreting physiology from cross-sectional biomarkers alone [^111ygkZd] [^117Rx7Wj].

> Next, I should review guidelines, and I need to be honest: most high-credibility guidance focuses on deficiency, not high B12. BSH recommends using MMA and sometimes holotranscobalamin to clarify biochemical deficiency but offers no directive for incidental hypercobalaminemia; KDIGO/UKKA include B12 in initial anemia workups in CKD but do not specify actions for elevated values; the ADA advises periodic B12 checks for metformin users to detect deficiency; expert reviews in Blood emphasize comprehensive anemia evaluation but similarly do not address isolated high B12 as a target for intervention [^116X2VPz] [^1145Ydz3] [^117NdERU] [^111tYivt] [^1123nFSh].

> Hold on, I should double-check the evidentiary strength. The Danish cohort is very large — about 350,000 people — an advantage for precision, with dose–response and temporal patterns that support a "red flag" interpretation; however, most cancer-risk data come from that same registry group and are rated low credibility here, and residual confounding by smoking, alcohol, occult disease, and testing indications is hard to exclude in observational designs [^117JpGBz] [^114GbcNy] [^116ouNKL]. I need to check triangulation: MR analyses suggest genetically higher B12 associates with modestly higher colorectal cancer risk, while one RCT combining folic acid with B12 reported more incident cancers, though other trials were null and power-limited; mortality studies in NHANES report conflicting associations for high B12 after adjustment, so causality remains unsettled [^115B2KtF] [^113qidmv] [^111NtGTL] [^117QLm8W].

> Now, translating this into practice, I should start with simple, high-yield steps. I need to ensure I exclude exogenous B12 exposure first, including recent injections, high-dose oral supplements, and fortified nutrition products; if present, I should hold and recheck in several weeks because assay validity can be affected by medications, and exogenous loading can mislead interpretation, especially in CKD [^112BAFUx] [^114iEtru].

> Next, I will examine for explanatory nonmalignant illness and functional B12 status. A repeat B12 with a CBC and differential, liver enzymes, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine/eGFR, CRP, LDH, and uric acid can signal marrow stress, cholestasis, renal disease, or systemic inflammation; if clinical concern for deficiency persists paradoxically, I should confirm with MMA and consider holotranscobalamin if available, given the limits of total B12 alone [^116X2VPz] [^1154xs65] [^112TSbGP] [^1123nFSh].

> But wait, what if the level is markedly high without an obvious cause? For unexplained levels above about 800 pmol/L, especially if persistent on repeat and accompanied by inflammatory or cytopenic signals, I should perform a careful symptom review and examination, verify that age‑appropriate cancer screening is up to date, and consider targeted imaging based on findings; CT abdomen/pel… Hold on, I should verify and complete that thought — CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is reasonable when hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease is suspected, and low‑dose chest CT is appropriate for high‑risk smokers per general screening guidance, while unexplained cytopenias or abnormal smear should prompt hematology referral [^114GbcNy] [^115E5RUY] [^1123nFSh].

> I need to think about special contexts. In CKD, endogenous high B12 should not be ascribed to impaired filtration; however, supraphysiologic dosing can push levels up due to saturable reabsorption, so I must be cautious with supplementation and interpretation; in cirrhosis or active inflammatory conditions, high B12 may track disease activity rather than create harm, prompting me to optimize nutritional deficiencies while addressing the underlying disorder; after bariatric surgery, combinatorial testing with MMA is preferred because total B12 can be misleading [^114iEtru] [^113XoZyb] [^1114J9u5].

> Let me reconsider the prognostic implications beyond diagnosis. Elevated B12 in cancer populations has been linked with higher short‑term mortality and unplanned hospitalizations when combined with CRP into a B12–CRP index, and registry data also connect high B12 with increased short‑term VTE risk around the time of cancer diagnosis, supporting its role as a marker of aggressive biology rather than a poison [^115KzQZa] [^114ESmjE].

> I should confirm the bottom line. High total B12 is not known to be intrinsically toxic, and guidelines do not endorse treating the number; nevertheless, unexplained and especially persistent hypercobalaminemia — most concerning above 800 pmol/L — can be a clinically meaningful "red flag" for underlying malignancy, liver disease, kidney disease, or systemic inflammation, warranting a structured evaluation rather than reassurance alone, while recognizing the evidence is largely observational and dominated by a single cohort [^114GbcNy] [^116X2VPz] [^113RJ78E].

Yes, an elevated B12 level is clinically meaningful because it is a **marker of underlying disease** [^113XoZyb] rather than a direct cause of harm. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) [^114GbcNy] without supplementation are associated with **increased cancer risk** (especially hematologic and solid tumors) [^115c4y6m], liver disease [^113XoZyb], renal dysfunction [^114iEtru], and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Elevated B12 is not toxic [^114iEtru], but it warrants evaluation for occult malignancy, liver disease, renal impairment, and inflammatory states [^1121hj3r]. If no cause is found, monitor and reassess; if supplementation is the cause, stop it and recheck levels.

## Clinical significance of elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 is not inherently harmful [^114iEtru]; however, it is a **marker of underlying disease** [^112cxq29]. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) [^114GbcNy] without supplementation are associated with increased risk of cancer [^114ksFri], liver disease [^113XoZyb], renal dysfunction [^114iEtru], and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [^113XoZyb].

---

## Conditions associated with elevated vitamin B12 levels

Several **conditions are linked to elevated B12 levels** [^113XoZyb]:

- **Malignancies**: Hematologic (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) [^114GbcNy] and solid tumors (e.g. liver, lung, colorectal, pancreatic) [^115c4y6m].

- **Liver disease**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^114iEtru] [^113XoZyb].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Chronic kidney disease [^114iEtru] and renal failure [^117J9xr9].

- **Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other chronic inflammatory states [^113XoZyb].

- **Hematologic disorders**: Myeloproliferative disorders and eosinophilia [^114GbcNy] [^112mGem1].

---

## Clinical implications and risks associated with elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 is a **marker of underlying disease** associated with:

- **Increased cancer risk**: Higher incidence of hematologic and solid tumors [^1121hj3r] [^114GbcNy].

- **Liver disease**: Associated with hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^113XoZyb].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Linked to chronic kidney disease and renal failure [^114iEtru].

- **Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions**: Associated with chronic inflammatory states [^113XoZyb].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of elevated vitamin B12 levels

When elevated B12 is detected, a **systematic evaluation** is recommended:

- **Confirm elevated B12 levels**: Repeat testing to rule out laboratory error [^112TSbGP].

- **Review medical history and medications**: Identify supplementation or medications that may elevate B12 [^112BAFUx].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver function tests, renal function tests, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and tumor markers as indicated.

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to evaluate for malignancy or organ dysfunction.

- **Specialist referral**: Hematology, oncology, or hepatology as indicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that an elevated B12 level is a **marker of underlying disease** and recommend:

- **Evaluate for underlying conditions**: Malignancy, liver disease, renal dysfunction, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions.

- **Monitor and reassess**: If no cause is identified, monitor and reassess periodically [^112TSbGP].

- **Discontinue supplementation**: If supplementation is the cause, discontinue and reassess [^112TSbGP].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated B12 is clinically meaningful as a **marker of underlying disease** [^113XoZyb]. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) [^114GbcNy] without supplementation are associated with increased risk of cancer [^1121hj3r], liver disease, renal dysfunction [^114iEtru], and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. A systematic evaluation is recommended to identify and manage underlying causes.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^111PmCSW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The standardized incidence ratios for inpatients and outpatients showed similar associations, both overall and by cancer group. The highest risks were found for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers and for hematological cancers. The estimates were highest for inpatients in all cancer groups, although cancer risk was elevated also for outpatients with high Cbl levels (data not shown).

When we examined the association between high Cbl levels and specific cancer types within the first year of follow-up, we found associations with gastric cancer (SIR = 13.24; 95% CI = 7.23 to 22.21; P < 0.001) and other types of cancer with Cbl levels > 800 pmol/L. The cancer risk remained elevated after the first year of follow-up for liver, pancreatic, lung cancer, and myeloid malignancies, with the highest standardized incidence ratios observed.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria, and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^114iEtru]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

B12 levels are a function of dietary intake, and deficiencies result from reduced intake or decreased absorption in the ileum. Defects in gut and proximal tubular transport proteins have been associated with albuminuria and B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency has been well described, but elevations in B12 levels have not been as well studied. There is no upper recommended daily limit for B12 as there are no documented cases of toxicity. However, elevations in B12 have been noted in association with various conditions, including liver disease, malignancies, and inflammatory disorders. The strongest predictor of elevated B12 levels in hospitalized patients is CKD. The mechanism for this increase is unclear.

Under normal circumstances, although B12 is filtered at the glomerulus, excretion in the urine is minimal due to reabsorption in the proximal tubule. As such, high B12 levels found in the setting of CKD should not be related to decreased clearance. However, in the setting of exogenous administration of B12, the kidneys are an important route for excretion as the reabsorptive mechanism is saturable. Thus, the administration of supraphysiologic doses of B12 to individuals with CKD could lead to an elevation in serum concentration.

Typically, there is an inverse relationship between levels of homocysteine and B12. However, this relationship is altered in patients with CKD. Although B12 supplementation reduces homocysteine levels in patients with CKD, it is less effective than in patients with normal renal function.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^114GbcNy]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients referred for plasma vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) measurement present with high Cbl levels, which have been reported in patients with different cancer types. However, the cancer risk among patients with newly diagnosed high Cbl levels has not been adequately examined.

- **Methods**: We conducted this cohort study using population-based Danish medical registries. Patients referred for Cbl measurement with levels greater than the lower reference limit (≥ 200 pmol/L) were identified from the population of Northern Denmark during the period of 1998 to 2009 using a database of laboratory test results covering the entire population. Data on cancer incidence (follow-up 1998–2010), Cbl treatment, and prior diagnoses were obtained from medical registries. Patients receiving Cbl treatment were excluded. Cancer risks were calculated as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by plasma Cbl levels. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified 333,667 persons without prevalent cancer and not receiving Cbl treatment. Six percent had Cbl levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). Cancer risk increased with higher Cbl levels and was highest during the first year of follow-up (Cbl 601–800 pmol/L: SIR = 3.44, 95% CI = 3.14 to 3.76; Cbl > 800 pmol/L: SIR = 6.27, 95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88; both P < .001). The risks were particularly elevated for hematological and smoking- and alcohol-related cancers for persons with high Cbl levels.

- **Conclusions**: High Cbl levels were associated with increased cancer risk.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically with respect to serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA), BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining serum total homocysteine and/or MMA, depending on availability, as supplementary tests. These should be considered to determine biochemical cobalamin deficiency in cases where there is clinical suspicion of deficiency but an indeterminate serum cobalamin level.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: Experience in NHANES [^117QLm8W]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Our sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our findings. The hazard ratio of low serum B12 for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality is similar in a subset of participants, i.e. those included between 1999 and 2006, but is no longer significant when adjusted additionally for homocysteine or MMA concentrations. Both have been considered biomarkers with high sensitivity, and in the case of MMA, also specificity, indicating B12 deficiency at the tissue level, although several authors have reported normal MMA values even with severely low serum B12 concentrations. Previously, we have shown in NHANES 2011–2014 participants that serum MMA concentrations were a more reliable predictor of complaints, functional status, and physical performance than serum B12. This may also explain why the association between serum B12 and mortality loses its significance when adjusted for MMA concentrations. The observed association between high serum B12 and cardiovascular mortality has a comparable hazard ratio of 1.41–1.46 for all sensitivity analyses but lost its significance due to a lower number of participants with complete data evaluated in the 1999–2006 surveys.

Prospective follow-up studies do have pitfalls. Dietary habits recorded at baseline may significantly change during the course of several years of follow-up, especially when people develop disorders like myocardial infarction or diabetes. Also, socioeconomic situations may improve or worsen, and alterations in exercise and other environmental factors like sleeping habits may occur.

### An atlas of associations between 14 micronutrients and 22 cancer outcomes: Mendelian randomization analyses [^115B2KtF]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Genetically predicted 1 SD higher levels of vitamin B12 were associated with 1.22 increased odds of colorectal cancer in the UKB and FinnGen meta-analysis, and 1.115 increased odds of colorectal cancer in the analysis using cancer consortium data. This result is consistent with that of a previous MR study that used colorectal cancer GWAS meta-analysis of GECCO and other consortium data, which reported 1.12 higher odds per 1 SD increase of genetically predicted vitamin B12 level of colorectal cancer (specifically, 1.1 higher odds of colon cancer and 1.21 higher odds of rectal cancer). Previous RCTs reported conflicting results. A long-term follow-up study of an RCT of 2,524 Caucasian participants compared 2–3 years of daily supplementation of folic acid (0.4 mg)/vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) and placebo, reporting a higher risk of colorectal cancer in the treatment group (hazard ratio = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.90). The median age of the participants was 74 years, and the median follow-up period was 78 months, resulting in 68 colorectal cancer cases. Another four-arm RCT assessed 6,837 Caucasian patients with ischemic heart disease, with a median age of 63 years. Patients were administered folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B12 (0.4 mg), or vitamin B6 (40 mg) for a median of 39 months and were followed for an additional 38 months, resulting in 95 colorectal cancer cases. In this study, the incidence of colorectal cancer did not differ according to the supplements received. One limitation of these trials was their low power. The latter trial reported 629 cases of any cancer, and the power to detect differences was limited.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning the indications for screening, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend monitoring serum vitamin B12 levels if there is a strong clinical suspicion of deficiency in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on metformin therapy.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^113XoZyb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) is an essential nutrient involved in one-carbon metabolism and cell division. A daily intake of 2 to 5 μg, together with efficient absorption, transportation, and transformation, is necessary to maintain health. In clinical practice, the measurement of total plasma Cbl is widely requested for the biochemical assessment of Cbl deficiency. Three studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients for whom Cbl measurement is requested have plasma Cbl levels greater than the upper limit of the reference range, with two of these studies demonstrating an association between high Cbl levels and cancer.

The association between elevated plasma Cbl levels and cancer risk is poorly understood. A high prevalence of elevated Cbl levels has been reported in patients with liver cancer, other solid tumors, and hematological malignancies. Conversely, some studies have indicated a high prevalence of cancer, both hematological and solid tumors, among patients with high Cbl levels. However, these studies are limited by their cross-sectional design, and only one study included a comparison group of patients with normal and low plasma Cbl levels. Most studies on normal or low Cbl levels in relation to cancer have been negative, except for some that have shown associations between increasing Cbl levels and lung and prostate cancer.

Elevated plasma Cbl levels have also been associated with several nonmalignant diseases, including liver diseases, alcoholism, and renal, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. However, only a few patients with these diseases have been observed.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels, with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. Serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory, and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. We also check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy.

- **Red flag signs**: Include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia. In such cases, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate between various causes.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin deficiency: Importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^1137q35K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels; however, the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Given that cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

- **Methods**: A retrospective record review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency over a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and measurement of MMA.

- **Results**: When "no" oxidant risks were present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < 0.01). In contrast, when "three or more" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, with elevated MMA and HCys values occurring in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

- **Conclusion**: In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when three or more oxidant risks are present.

### Serum vitamin B12 levels and glycemic fluctuation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111VMTJK]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic disease associated with several complications that negatively affect patients' quality of life and contribute to a significant clinical and economic burden to society. It is well known that optimal blood glucose control is important to reduce the incidence of diabetes complications, and extreme glycemic fluctuation is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. Moreover, evaluation of daily glucose fluctuations provides baseline information for the clinical management of T2DM. Therefore, regular glycemic fluctuation monitoring should be considered an important component of routine clinical management of patients with T2DM.

Reportedly, B-vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, are implicated in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance, and vitamin B12 levels tend to decrease with increasing severity of glucose tolerance. It is well known that vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with increased risk of gestational DM. A recent study also reported that add-on supplementation with vitamin B12 can improve glycemic control and insulin resistance in T2DM patients. Reportedly, patients with diabetes have higher serum vitamin B12 levels than those with normal glycemic control, and fructosamine levels are significantly correlated with serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with DM, which suggests that serum vitamin B12 levels may be associated with glycemic control in T2DM. However, no study has investigated the correlation between serum vitamin B12 levels and glycemic fluctuation in patients with T2DM.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^117NdERU]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning indications for screening in CKD, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia panel. This includes a complete blood count (CBC), absolute reticulocyte count, serum ferritin level, and serum transferrin saturation. Additionally, the measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be part of the initial evaluation of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of age and CKD stage.

### Hydroxocobalamin [^112BAFUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Precautions**: The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy. Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and, since it might improve folic acid-deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis.

- **Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis**: These could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.

- **Polycythemia vera**: Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility have not been performed with hydroxocobalamin.

- **Pregnancy**: Teratogenic effects — Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroxocobalamin. It is also not known whether hydroxocobalamin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hydroxocobalamin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^114ksFri]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Risk of specific cancer types within the first year after plasma cobalamin (Cbl) measurement is demonstrated. The figure shows the 1-year standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), disaggregated according to Cbl levels: x represents 200 to 600 pmol/L, o represents 601 to 800 pmol/L, and □ denotes greater than 800 pmol/L. The vertical gray line indicates a standardized incidence ratio of 1. All statistical tests were two-sided.

The associations between cancer risk and high Cbl levels remained robust in patients with selected morbidities, with no differences among specific morbidities (data not shown).

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^113Cjrx9]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the general population presents a notable concern. Several cross-sectional studies and case reports have documented an increased frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency among type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. Metformin use has been unequivocally demonstrated as the prime factor associated with vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM.

Studies assessing type 2 diabetic patients on metformin have reported the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency to range from 5.8% to 33%. This wide variation in the reported prevalence could probably be explained by the varied study definitions of vitamin B12 deficiency. In the cross-sectional study by Pflipsen et al. on 203 outpatient type 2 diabetic patients at a large military primary care clinic in the United States, definite vitamin B12 deficiency was defined as serum vitamin B12 concentrations of 243 nmol/L or homocysteine concentrations of > 11.9 nmol/L if serum vitamin B12 concentrations were between 100 to 350 pg/mL. Reinstatler et al. in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1999–2006 in the United States defined definite and borderline biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency as serum vitamin B12 concentrations of ≤ 148 pmol/L and 148–221 pmol/L, respectively.

In one cross-sectional study that documented a high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency of 33% among adult patients with T2DM by Qureshi et al, vitamin B12 deficiency was defined as serum vitamin B12 concentrations < 150 pg/mL.

### High serum vitamin B12 levels associated with C-reactive protein in older patients with cancer [^115KzQZa]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been proposed to assess prognosis and adapt oncological care in older patients with cancer. However, few biological markers are incorporated in the CGA.

- **Methods**: This comparative study on older patients with cancer was conducted before the final therapeutic decision and during a CGA that included biological markers. The objective was to determine if the serum vitamin B12-C-reactive protein index (BCI) can help estimate early death and unplanned hospitalization. Associations between BCI and unplanned hospitalization or mortality were analyzed using ordered multivariate logistic regression.

- **Findings**: We included 621 older cancer adults in outpatient care with a median age of 81 years (range, 70–98 years) from September 2015 to May 2018. In this study, 5.6% of patients died within 3 months, 8.8% had unplanned hospitalization within 1 month, and 11.4% had unplanned hospitalization within 3 months. Hypercobalaminemia was present in 83 patients (13.4%), and 34 patients (5.5%) had BCI > 40,000. According to the multivariate analysis, BCI was a prognostic factor of mortality within 3 months and unplanned hospitalizations at 1 and 3 months. Impaired activities of daily living (ADL) and palliative care were also risk factors for mortality within 3 months. Impaired instrumental ADL, low albumin level, and palliative care were risk factors for unplanned hospitalization at 1 month.

- **Interpretation**: BCI could be routinely added to the CGA process, as part of a pretreatment workup, to assess frailties more precisely.

### Plasma vitamin B12 levels, high-dose vitamin B12 treatment, and risk of dementia [^113PAZJZ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis, primarily involving people without dementia, did not find an effect of B vitamin treatment in any cognitive domain, and another meta-analysis concluded that B12 treatment does not affect cognitive performance or prevent cognitive decline. Smith and Refsum questioned these conclusions by arguing that most studies did not effectively identify the population at risk, namely those who are B vitamin deficient. However, we found no association between dementia and B12 treatment in the at-risk population with low P-B12 or high P-MMA, nor could we show any specific effect of three different high-dose B12 drugs. Our results suggest that screening for and treating B12 deficiency have no effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, we did not include direct measures of cognitive function.

Earlier clinical guidelines published by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended routine screening for B12 deficiency among patients suspected of dementia. This recommendation was not included in the recently updated UK guideline. However, the American Academy of Neurology and European guidelines recommend the routine assessment of B12 levels. Our findings support the recent UK clinical guidelines and suggest that European and US guidelines should follow suit.

Our study has limitations. We studied patients who had a P-B12 measurement without knowing the clinical indication for the test. This patient group might have different disease risk profiles compared to the general population and also according to P-B12 levels.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113q479s]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The findings of this study reinforce the growing body of evidence linking metformin use with reduced serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with T2DM. The mean age group of the participants was 50.79 ± 12.63 years, which is consistent with findings from the study by Raizada et al. where the mean age was reported as 50.1 ± 11.5 years. Such age distribution similarities emphasize our findings' relevance to broader populations of middle‐aged adults with T2DM.

Our data revealed that the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the M group was 23.84%, which aligns with previous studies, such as Kim et al.'s cross‐sectional study, which reported a similar prevalence of 22.2% among long‐term metformin users.

Additionally, borderline vitamin B12 deficiency was found in 20.64% of the M group, corroborating studies that have identified a comparable proportion of patients with borderline levels, with 18.0% in one study and 20.6% in another.

Several proposed mechanisms explain how metformin interferes with vitamin B12 absorption. Metformin appears to reduce the calcium‐dependent channels that facilitate the binding of the intrinsic factor–vitamin B12 complex to cubilin receptors in the terminal ileum, thereby impeding absorption. Furthermore, metformin may reduce intrinsic factor secretion from gastric parietal cells, further contributing to diminished absorption. This multifactorial interference highlights the need for regular monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in metformin-treated patients, as recommended by the ADA.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency — an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We present an update on the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency, such as the elderly and those with intestinal diseases.

- **Measurement strategies**: Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis, followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unresolved cases. Recent evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins; measurement of holoTC is currently being introduced in clinical settings.

- **Cause evaluation**: No consensus exists regarding the evaluation of the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons of the various tests, mainly aiming at evaluating the function of the gastric mucosa, are presented.

Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed, efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 months or by a daily dose of 1 mg of vitamin B12.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112X7DjX]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study highlights the significant reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels among patients with T2DM receiving metformin therapy compared with those not on metformin. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was notably higher in the metformin-treated group, with no clear correlation observed between deficiency and metformin dose or duration of diabetes. These findings emphasize the critical need for routine monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in patients undergoing metformin therapy to detect and manage deficiencies early. Furthermore, the study underlines the efficacy of metformin in improving glycaemic control, evidenced by significantly lower HbA1c levels in the metformin group. Future research should focus on prospective studies with larger cohorts to further understand the long-term implications of metformin use on vitamin B12 levels and overall patient health.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. Clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur and progress when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor. Most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. These principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status.

Clinicians must also grapple with the premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: diagnosing cobalamin deficiency correctly, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112RwYCQ]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning indications for screening, the 2015 ECCO guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia workup. This includes at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration in patients with low hemoglobin levels. A more extensive workup should include serum vitamin B12 measurement.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^113RJ78E]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Our study also was able to examine clinical routine practice. We showed that approximately 15% of the population in Northern Denmark has had a plasma Cbl measurement during the study period and that these measurements show Cbl levels within or above the reference range. This suggests that plasma Cbl measurements are used routinely and frequently to screen for Cbl deficiency in the presence of symptoms or other risks. Although our study cannot directly assess the use of high Cbl levels as a nonspecific marker of cancer, our findings may be relevant to the clinical interpretation of such high levels.

A number of various diseases have been suggested as causing high Cbl levels, but common to most of them is that the pathogenesis involving elevated Cbl levels is not fully understood. In principle, some of these diseases might be responsible for the long-term associations observed in our study, thereby possibly confounding the associations between high Cbl levels and cancer. For example, the association between liver cancer and high Cbl levels could, in theory, be caused by nonmalignant liver disease underlying the liver cancer. However, when we stratified the analyses according to prior diseases, the results remained robust. This indicates that high Cbl levels could be a marker for cancer both in the short and long term, exceeding 5 years for hematological cancers. Such persistent long-term associations are more likely to be affected by unrecorded confounders, such as lifestyle factors. Although smoking is not associated with disruptions in Cbl status, alcohol consumption may play a role.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^112akMfR]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

- **Results**: Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = -0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = -2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = -0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, p = 0.015).

- **Interpretation**: Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum. These findings challenge the assumption that normal B12 levels are uniformly non-harmful and suggest that even within the normal range, variations in B12 levels can be associated with neurological changes.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^115c4y6m]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Our study shows that elevated plasma cobalamin (Cbl) levels are markers for various types of cancers, most notably hematological cancers within the first year after Cbl measurement. These findings remained robust in the stratified analyses.

Our results extend those of earlier research by showing a strong association between elevated Cbl levels and cancer in a large study with a longitudinal design. Earlier studies have examined Cbl levels in patients with selected cancers. The majority of these previous studies have been negative, except for lung and prostate cancer. We focused on high Cbl levels and thereby avoided the limitations of these earlier studies. Our study was based on a large cohort of patients referred for plasma Cbl measurement rather than patients with a particular type of cancer or persons from the general population. Unlike the earlier studies, we assessed risk among patients with Cbl levels above a given reference range. Because we specifically focused on high Cbl levels, we were able to demonstrate associations with cancer, including types not previously associated with high Cbl levels, such as cancers of the pancreas and urinary bladder and multiple myeloma.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: A critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys are subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Since SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis relies solely on biochemical biomarkers, making their optimal application crucial, yet unsettled.

This review critically examines the diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in the degree but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks is vital. Causation by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials, thus conclusions from SCCD data may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa.

Although many investigators consider cobalamin testing unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less so in SCCD. The absence of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to evaluate the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside of their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections heavily affect diagnostic conclusions and need better rationalization. Today, maximizing the reliability and specificity of diagnosis is more critical than identifying ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all biomarkers suggest that the combination…

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: Experience in NHANES [^111NtGTL]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

There is conflicting evidence in the literature on the association between elevated serum B12 concentrations and subsequent disease or mortality. We evaluated the association of serum B12 concentrations, as well as vitamin B12 supplement intake, with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality in the NHANES general population, while taking into account demographic and lifestyle factors, along with significant other diseases known to be associated with poorer outcomes.

- **Methods**: The main outcomes of our study were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer-related mortality. Mortality status and cause of death were determined by NHANES-linked National Death Index public access files through December 31, 2015. The association of serum B12 concentrations and vitamin B12 supplement intake with mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazard (PH) models, with adjustments for several relevant demographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidities.

- **Results**: The final study population of 24,262 participants had a mean age of 48 (SD 19) years, with 50.1% being males. The median follow-up duration was 109 months (range 1–201 months). As of the census day on December 31, 2015, 3,023 participants were determined to be deceased (12.5%). The fully adjusted Cox PH model indicated that low serum B12 concentrations below 700 pmol/l were associated with [Text appears incomplete]

### Cancer incidence and mortality after treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 [^113qidmv]. JAMA (2009). Low credibility.

Recently, concern has been raised about the safety of folic acid, particularly in relation to cancer risk. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with B vitamins on cancer outcomes and all-cause mortality in two randomized controlled trials.

The design involved a combined analysis and extended follow-up of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial. A total of 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with B vitamins or placebo between 1998 and 2005 and were followed up through December 31, 2007.

- **Interventions**: Oral treatment was provided with combinations of folic acid (0.8 mg/d), vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/d), and vitamin B6 (40 mg/d) among different groups: folic acid plus vitamin B12 plus vitamin B6 (n = 1708); folic acid plus vitamin B12 (n = 1703); vitamin B6 alone (n = 1705); or placebo (n = 1721).

- **Main outcome measures**: The study measured cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality.

Results from the study indicated that during the treatment phase, the median serum folate concentration increased more than six-fold among participants given folic acid. After a median of 39 months of treatment and an additional 38 months of post-trial observational follow-up, 341 participants (10.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 compared to 288 participants (8.4%) who did not receive such treatment were diagnosed with cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.41; p = 0.02). A total of 136 (4.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 compared to 100 (2.9%) who did not receive such treatment died from cancer.

Figure 1 presents the first-year standardized incidence ratios in detailed cobalamin (Cbl) level intervals, indicating that only the risks of smoking- and alcohol-related cancers and hematological cancers substantially increased with higher Cbl levels. It also shows that a specific Cbl level cutoff for high cancer risk could not be established. The standardized incidence ratios were elevated fourfold to 37-fold for hematological cancers, twofold to 10-fold for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers, and twofold to threefold for hormone-related cancers; they were not elevated for immune-related cancers.

### Long-term metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study [^111UhRAv]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with metformin treatment, but few studies have assessed the risk with long-term use.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk of B12 deficiency with metformin use in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).

- **Design**: Secondary analysis from the DPP/DPPOS. Participants were assigned to the placebo group (PLA) (n = 1082) or the metformin group (MET) (n = 1073) for 3.2 years; subjects in the MET group received open-label metformin for an additional 9 years.

- **Setting**: Twenty-seven study centers in the United States.

- **Patients**: DPP eligibility criteria included elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and overweight/obesity. The analytic population comprised participants with available stored samples. B12 levels were assessed at 5 years (n = 857, n = 858) and 13 years (n = 756, n = 764) in PLA and MET, respectively.

- **Intervention**: Metformin 850 mg twice daily versus placebo in the DPP, and open-label metformin in the MET group during DPPOS.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: B12 deficiency, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

- **Results**: Low B12 (≤ 203 pg/mL) occurred more often in MET than PLA at 5 years (4.3% vs 2.3%; p = 0.02) but not at 13 years (7.4% vs 5.4%; p = 0.12). Combined low and borderline-low B12 (≤ 298 pg/mL) was more common in MET at 5 years (19.1% vs 9.5%; P < .01) and 13 years (20.3% vs 15.6%; p = 0.02). Years of metformin use were associated with an increased risk of B12 deficiency (odds ratio for B12 deficiency per year of metformin use, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.20). Anemia prevalence was higher in MET, but further details are needed.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results for cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid used to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies and technical issues; local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test results and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^117Rx7Wj]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **High unavailable B12 association**: High levels of unavailable B12 are associated with an elevation in biomarkers for neurodegeneration.

	- **Protein T‐Tau relationship**: There is a significant positive association between the levels of total measured B12 and the levels of the protein T‐Tau (z‐score adjusted for age, sex, BMI, CVRF, education, HbA1C, APOEε4 status, and creatinine).
	- **T‐Tau and holo‐TC correlation**: No correlation was found between T‐Tau and Holo‐TC.
	- **T‐Tau and holo‐HC association**: A significant positive association exists between T‐Tau and derived Holo‐HC.
	- **UCH‐L1 correlation**: Another biomarker of neuroaxonal injury, UCH‐L1, correlated positively with the levels of derived Holo‐HC.

### Improving bariatric patient aftercare outcome by improved detection of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency [^114nGRdp]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common after bariatric surgery. Vitamin B12 is a poor predictor of functional vitamin B12 status since deficiencies might even occur within the reference limits. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiencies with serum vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L remain undetected. Methylmalonic acid (MMA), however, will detect these deficiencies as it accumulates due to functional intracellular vitamin B12 deficiencies. MMA is a relatively expensive analysis and is therefore not generally available. To lower costs, we only request MMA when vitamin B12 levels are between these limits. As a result, more biochemical deficiencies are found. However, it was not known whether bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L would benefit from supplementation.

- **Method**: Bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L, with (n = 45) and without (n = 45) intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections, were compared.

- **Results**: Treated patients showed a significant increase in vitamin B12 levels (P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in MMA levels (P < 0.001). Biochemical improvement occurs in both patients with and without clinical symptoms. The control group showed a significant increase in MMA levels (P < 0.001). To examine whether the biochemical benefits of vitamin B12 supplementation are correlated with clinical improvement, patient records were checked for complaints. Complaints disappeared after treatment, while no improvement was seen in untreated patients.

- **Conclusion**: This study shows that all bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L could benefit from supplementation.

### Dual pathology as a result of spinal stenosis and vitamin B12 deficiency [^111PD2cY]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can confound the clinical assessment of patients presenting with features of spinal disorders. Speciality practice within spinal surgery may lead clinicians to focus on spinal explanations for symptoms, a belief that may be reinforced by supportive imaging. In the presence of mainly sensory symptoms, consideration and exclusion of non-surgical causes need to occur.

This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency, the presence of dual pathology on imaging performed, the implementation of replacement therapy, and their subsequent clinical response as perceived by patients. This was performed through a retrospective review of patients presenting to specialist spine outpatient clinics over a 4-year period using access to pathology reports followed by a telephone survey.

A total of 457 patients were investigated, of which 8.5% were vitamin B12 deficient. Of these, 70% had repeat levels measured, and 31% continued to be deficient. Notably, 26% of these patients were not placed on any supplemental therapy. Among patients on treatment, 72% reported self-perceived improved outcomes, compared with 55% of those not receiving treatment. Additionally, 73% of patients underwent MRI/CT imaging, with 59% showing evidence of spinal stenosis.

In older patients with sensory symptoms, the coexistence of B12 deficiency should be considered. Detection of deficiency with consequent treatment results in better global outcomes than no treatment. Unless the correct blood test is conducted, the pathology will remain undetected, and patients may continue with their primary symptoms despite undergoing high-risk spinal surgery.

### Nascobal [^115dQdqx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Use in specific populations: Refer to patient counseling information.

- **Pregnancy**: The risk summary suggests that the limited available data on Nascobal in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin, and requirements increase during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vitamin B12. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**: The risk summary indicates that vitamin B12 is present in the milk of lactating women in concentrations which approximate the mother's vitamin B12 blood level. Vitamin B12 does not appear to pose more than a minimal risk to breastfeeding children.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of Nascobal did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

### Efficacy of B vitamins in lowering homocysteine in older men: Maximal effects for those with B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia [^113oVPpr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

A higher plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies, largely in younger individuals, have shown that B vitamins lower tHcy by substantial amounts and that this effect is greater in people with higher tHcy and lower folate levels.

- **Methods**: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 299 men aged 75 years or older, comparing treatment with a daily tablet containing 2 mg of folate, 25 mg of B6, and 400 micrograms of B12 or placebo. The study groups were balanced regarding age (mean ± SD, 78.9 ± 2.8 years), B vitamins, and tHcy at baseline.

- **Results**: Among the 13% with B12 deficiency, the difference in mean changes in treatment and control groups for tHcy was 6.74 micromol/L (95% CI, 3.94 to 9.55 micromol/L) compared with 2.88 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.07 to 5.69 micromol/L) for all others. Among the 20% with hyperhomocysteinemia, the difference between mean changes in treatment and control groups for men with high plasma tHcy compared with the rest of the group was 2.8 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9 micromol/L). Baseline vitamin B12, serum folate, and tHcy were significantly associated with changes in plasma tHcy at follow-up (r = 0.252, r = 0.522, and r = -0.903, respectively; P = 0.003, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) in the vitamin group.

- **Conclusions**: The tHcy-lowering effect of B vitamins was maximal in those who had low B12 or high tHcy levels. Community-dwelling older men, who are likely to be deficient in B12 or have hyperhomocysteinemia, may benefit from B vitamin supplementation.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: An observational cohort study [^117J9xr9]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The findings of this study are fourfold. First, we found that vitamin B12 was not associated with albuminuria or reduced kidney function (RKF) in the univariate or multivariable-adjusted model. However, elevated levels of B12 were associated cross-sectionally with a higher odds of albuminuria after adjusting for the plasma homocysteine concentration. After further stratification by the median homocysteine concentration, the association between B12 and albuminuria remained only in the higher homocysteine group. However, this result did not replicate in the NHANES cohort.

Third, elevated B12 levels were associated cross-sectionally with a higher odds of RKF after adjusting for the plasma homocysteine concentration. The association between B12 and RKF remained only in the higher homocysteine group after stratification by the median homocysteine level. This result was confirmed in participants from the NHANES cohort. Finally, there was no association between B12 levels and incident albuminuria and RKF.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels and risk of venous thromboembolism among cancer patients: A population-based cohort study [^114ESmjE]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and high plasma vitamin B12 levels (cobalamin, Cbl) are markers of occult cancer and aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. In this population-based cohort study, we assessed VTE risk among cancer patients with high plasma Cbl levels.

- **Materials and methods**: We used Danish health registries to identify a Cb1 cohort of 25,310 cancer patients with a plasma Cbl measurement prior to cancer diagnosis. The cohort was subdivided according to Cbl levels (pmol/L): 200–600 (population reference range), 601–800, and > 800. All VTE events were considered provoked and categorized as either cancer-associated if no other provoking factors were present before VTE, or provoked by other risk factors (surgery, trauma, or pregnancy). We calculated cumulative incidence proportions and adjusted hazard ratios computed from Cox regression analysis (reference: plasma Cbl of 200–600 pmol/L) for the risk of VTE before and after the cancer diagnosis date (index date).

- **Results**: The risk of cancer-associated VTE 30 days after the index date increased with higher Cbl levels. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) by Cbl levels was: 200–600 pmol/L: 0.24 (0.18–0.31); 601–800 pmol/L: 0.63 (0.34–1.09); > 800 pmol/L: 0.86 (0.49–1.40). Adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) were: 601–800 vs. 200–600: 2.55 (1.32–4.92); > 800 vs. 200–600: 2.36 (1.19–4.71). We found similar results for VTE provoked by other risk factors and for VTE occurring before the index date, but scarcity of events produced uncertain risk estimates.

- **Conclusion**: We demonstrated an association between high plasma Cbl levels and increased risk of VTE among cancer patients. The findings highlight the potential role of elevated Cbl levels as a marker of thromboembolic risk in this patient population.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1129fB6r]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Blood sampling and laboratory analysis

At both time points (pre- and post-intervention), a non-fasting 50 mL blood sample was obtained from each participant on the day of sampling. For research biomarkers, all sample preparation and fractionation were carried out within 4 hours of collection, and blood aliquots were stored at −70°C until batch analysis at the end of the trial.

B-vitamin biomarkers were analyzed centrally using established methods at BEVITAL AS (Bergen, Norway; vitamin B12, folate, total homocysteine [tHcy], methylmalonic acid [MMA]) or UU, Coleraine (vitamin B6, riboflavin). Microbiological assays, based on a chloramphenicol-resistant strain of Lactobacillus casei and a colistin sulphate-resistant strain of Lactobacillus leichmannii, were used to determine serum folate and serum total vitamin B12 concentrations, respectively. Serum concentrations of tHcy and MMA were analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based on methylchloroformate derivatization.

A combined indicator of vitamin B12 (cB12) status was calculated using serum total vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy concentrations, with the value corrected for age and serum folate concentrations as described elsewhere. A cB12 indicator value of ≤ −0.5 was defined as low and deficient status. Plasma pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), a marker of vitamin B6 status, was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Riboflavin status (vitamin B2) was measured by erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac), which is widely accepted as the gold standard method.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^112cxq29]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The underlying pathogenesis leading to high Cbl levels is poorly elucidated, with a few exceptions. It is not thought to involve increased Cbl intake because intestinal absorption capacity is saturable, and high physiological consumption does not increase plasma Cbl levels substantially. Only Cbl therapy, in the form of injections or extremely high oral doses, can produce high circulating levels. In this study, patients treated with Cbl were excluded. We therefore conclude that the mechanisms resulting in high Cbl levels may be related to malignant pathogenesis. Our recent study showed that levels of the circulating Cbl binding protein, haptocorrin, were high in patients with high plasma Cbl levels. Moreover, cancer was associated with high Cbl and high haptocorrin levels. This protein originates from various tissues, but its physiological function remains unknown. It is elevated in patients with some cancer types and has been suggested as a marker for disease progression. Thus, haptocorrin may be a candidate factor to include in future studies of the possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to high Cbl levels in cancer patients, in particular for the novel associations demonstrated in this study.

In conclusion, our study showed that high plasma Cbl levels increased the risk of subsequently diagnosed cancer, mostly within the first year of follow-up. However, this association was not present for all cancer types. Although our results may have clinical implications for interpreting high Cbl levels, further studies are warranted to examine the possible diagnostic value of this marker.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^117JpGBz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

We identified 352,831 persons without prevalent cancer who had plasma Cbl levels ≥ 200 pmol/L, of which 19,164 patients were receiving Cbl therapy at the time of plasma Cbl measurement and were therefore excluded. Of the patients included in the study, 19,665 (6%) had levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). The total number of person-years of follow-up was 1,421,512, and the median follow-up time was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.9–6.2 years). The median age was 55.1 years (IQR = 40.2–69.2 years). The distribution of outpatients and inpatients was 276,229 (83%) and 57,438 (17%), respectively. A total of 22,652 (7%) patients in the study cohort subsequently developed cancer during the period from 1998 to 2010.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with adverse lipid profile in Europeans and Indians with type 2 diabetes [^1151WMcM]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Metformin, a standard therapy in type 2 diabetes, reduces vitamin B12 levels. Studies linking low vitamin B12 levels and cardiovascular disease are equivocal and suggest improving B12 levels may help in primary prevention. The role of vitamin B12 deficiency on cardiovascular risk factors, especially in type 2 diabetes, has not been explored. The aim of this study is to investigate whether vitamin B12 deficiency in type 2 diabetes patients is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in two different ethnic groups in the UK and India.

- **Methods**: Type 2 diabetes patients from two secondary care diabetic centres (Europeans - UK and Indians - India) were studied. Serum vitamin B12, folate, and biochemical parameters were measured.

- **Results**: The prevalence rates of vitamin B12 deficiency (< 191 ng/L) were 27% and 12% in Europeans and Indians, respectively, and higher in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. In linear regression analysis, after adjusting for all likely confounding factors, vitamin B12 was independently associated with triglycerides in both populations and the cholesterol/HDL ratio in Indians. Logistic regression showed type 2 diabetes patients with vitamin B12 deficiency were at significantly higher odds of having coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) in Europeans, with a similar but non-significant trend in Indians, after adjusting for all likely confounding factors.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency is common in type 2 diabetes patients and is associated with adverse lipid parameters. Type 2 diabetes management guidelines should include considerations for monitoring and managing vitamin B12 deficiency to mitigate cardiovascular risk factors.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^1121hj3r]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The overall standardized incidence ratio was 1.26 (95% CI = 1.24 to 1.28; P < 0.001) for plasma levels greater than 800 pmol/L (SIR = 6.27, 95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88, P < 0.001). Overall, Cbl-associated cancer risk decreased with increasing age and was higher for men than for women. For all cancer groups, the first-year risk increased with higher Cbl levels, most substantially for levels greater than 800 pmol/L. After the first year, the risk remained elevated for patients with Cbl levels greater than 800 pmol/L for smoking and alcohol-related cancers, and for hematological cancers.

The standardized incidence ratios also remained elevated after the first year in patients with Cbl levels in the 601 to 800 pmol/L range for smoking and alcohol-related cancers. For hematological cancers and smoking and alcohol-related cancers, the standardized incidence ratios remained elevated for more than 5 years of follow-up, although for hematological cancers, this was the case only for patients with Cbl levels greater than 800 pmol/L.

The numbers and percentages of patients diagnosed with cancer according to plasma Cbl levels and length of follow-up are as follows: Overall: 200 to 600 pmol/L: 6.7%, 601 to 800 pmol/L: 7.8%, and greater than 800 pmol/L: 11.0%. First year: 200 to 600 pmol/L: 2.3%, 601 to 800 pmol/L: 3.7%, and greater than 800 pmol/L: 6.6%.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116rzU6b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population-based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 levels at the extremes of the population distribution, which can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well-defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation.

Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained. Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often-reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms.

When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo-TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated for by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo-TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system.

### Hypervitaminosis B12: an indicator of potential significant morbidity [^1137SHhF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of vitamin B12 deficiency, treated with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, was attending a specialist clinic for the management of persisting breathlessness following a previous pulmonary embolism. She reported that a persistently elevated vitamin B12 had been identified several months previously, despite the withdrawal of replacement therapy, and that the cause could not be explained to her by her general practitioner.

Recognition of the potentially serious implications of this finding led to the identification of a pancreatic tumour which, by the time of diagnosis, had become too advanced for active management. We describe the metabolism of vitamin B12 in the context of hypervitaminosis B12 as a reflection of elevated transcobalamin consequent to underlying disease and the need to promptly identify the underlying cause.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^111ygkZd]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by an automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

- **Results**: Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22; p = 0.015).

- **Interpretation**: Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum.
