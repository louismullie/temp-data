## Question

Pulmonary edema with renal failure, elevated bnp, elevated creatinine, palpitations and trouble breathing treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of pulmonary edema with renal failure, elevated BNP, elevated creatinine, palpitations, and trouble breathing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing cardiogenic pulmonary edema from other causes. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic profile and risk stratify. Next, I will outline immediate stabilization, including oxygen, nitrates, and diuretics, while balancing renal perfusion. After that, I need to address diuretic resistance and consider escalation strategies. Then, I should plan monitoring and biomarker-guided reassessment. Finally, I will integrate disease-modifying therapy, consider special populations like HFpEF, and close with disposition and follow-up planning, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because dyspnea with elevated BNP and renal dysfunction has a broad differential including HFpEF, COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and high-output states. I should integrate history, exam, chest radiography, ECG, and echocardiography to establish cardiogenic pulmonary edema, recognizing that BNP is sensitive but less specific in renal failure and that obesity or HFpEF can blunt natriuretic peptide levels, so I need to interpret BNP in clinical context and consider serial trends rather than a single value [^112PLGK6] [^111xdtrT] [^113nSzin].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic phenotype before choosing therapy. Most patients with acute decompensated heart failure present with congestion without overt hypoperfusion, but I should check for hypotension, narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, and mental status changes that would suggest low output or cardiogenic shock, because that shifts management toward inotropes and vasopressors rather than aggressive vasodilation or diuresis [^111xdtrT] [^113VbQJu].

> I will now examine immediate stabilization. Oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 95% is foundational, and noninvasive ventilation is indicated for severe respiratory distress or hypercapnia. I should also obtain continuous cardiac monitoring given palpitations and the risk of arrhythmias in acute HF, and I need to ensure early IV access and frequent vitals while I titrate therapy [^116p3fuF].

> Next, I should review vasodilator therapy. If systolic blood pressure is ≥ 150 mmHg, I should start high-dose IV nitrates to rapidly reduce preload and afterload, improve pulmonary congestion, and relieve dyspnea. If SBP is 90–150 mmHg, cautious titration is reasonable, but I need to avoid hypotension that could worsen renal perfusion, so I will monitor closely and adjust dosing every few minutes initially [^1133CB3u].

> Hold on, I should verify diuretic strategy in the context of renal dysfunction. Loop diuretics remain first-line for pulmonary edema, but in renal failure I may need higher doses and consider continuous infusion to overcome reduced delivery to the nephron. I should start with IV furosemide 40–100 mg or an equivalent bolus and escalate based on urine output and clinical response, while watching for electrolyte disturbances and further creatinine rises, and I should remember that diuretic monotherapy may be less effective than when combined with nitrates in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema [^115ZNbty] [^1133CB3u].

> But wait, what if there is diuretic resistance or worsening renal function despite escalating loop therapy. I should double-check for true resistance: inadequate dose, poor bioavailability, NSAID use, or very low GFR, and then consider adding a thiazide-type diuretic such as metolazone or chlorthalidone to potentiate natriuresis, recognizing the risk of profound electrolyte shifts and the need for close monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes every 1–2 days initially [^115ZNbty].

> I need to ensure I am not missing a role for inotropes. If the patient is in a low-output state with SBP < 90 mmHg, signs of hypoperfusion, or refractory congestion despite optimal vasodilation and diuresis, short-term inotrope therapy such as dobutamine or milrinone may be indicated, but I should use the lowest effective dose and plan for the shortest possible duration given arrhythmia risk and lack of mortality benefit, and I should involve cardiology early in this scenario [^111xdtrT] [^112nhdJJ].

> Let me consider ultrafiltration carefully. In diuretic-refractory cases with persistent congestion and worsening renal function, especially when the renal injury appears hemodynamic rather than intrinsic, early ultrafiltration can remove isotonic fluid without provoking neurohormonal activation, but I should confirm that diuretic resistance is present and that the patient is likely to benefit, as UF is resource-intensive and not universally superior to optimized pharmacologic therapy [^115hZA5X].

> Next, I should review monitoring and biomarker-guided reassessment. Daily weights, strict intake and output, frequent electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are essential, and I should obtain repeat BNP or NT-proBNP after 24–48 hours to gauge response. A substantial reduction in natriuretic peptides correlates with improved outcomes, whereas failure to decrease by about 30% is associated with higher mortality and readmissions, so I will use this to guide intensity of decongestion and discharge readiness [^113L2PHH] [^111HTVYb].

> I will now examine disease-modifying therapy once the patient is stabilized. If HFrEF is present, I should initiate or up-titrate guideline-directed medical therapy including ACE inhibitor or ARNI, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor as tolerated, recognizing that renal dysfunction may require slower titration and closer monitoring of potassium and creatinine, and that temporary holds may be needed if hypotension or hyperkalemia emerge [^111xdtrT].

> Hold on, I should verify HFpEF-specific considerations. There is no single disease-modifying therapy with robust mortality benefit in HFpEF, so management focuses on aggressive treatment of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and atrial fibrillation, and I should confirm the diagnosis with echocardiography and consider that normal BNP does not exclude HFpEF, particularly in obesity or with mild disease [^116tXehv] [^113nSzin].

> I need to check for arrhythmias given palpitations. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is common in acute HF and can worsen congestion; rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is appropriate once euvolemia is approached, and I should consider anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc, while also watching for ventricular arrhythmias that may necessitate electrolyte correction and, rarely, antiarrhythmic therapy or device evaluation [^111xdtrT].

> Let me reconsider renal protection strategies. Avoiding nephrotoxins, maintaining adequate perfusion pressure, and using the lowest effective diuretic dose to achieve decongestion are key. If creatinine rises modestly with effective decongestion, I should not reflexively stop life-prolonging HF therapies, but if creatinine exceeds about 3.0 mg/dL or rises rapidly, I should reassess volume status, diuretic strategy, and consider nephrology input for potential ultrafiltration or temporary dialysis to facilitate decongestion and drug tolerance [^111cBXXm] [^11447zAy].

> I should confirm disposition planning. Patients with persistent congestion, significant renal dysfunction, hypotension, or high-risk features warrant ICU-level care, whereas stabilized patients without hypoperfusion may be managed on a telemetry floor with close monitoring. Before discharge, I need to ensure near-euvolemia, stable renal function, optimized oral regimen, and a 7-day follow-up plan, and I should arrange early cardiology or HF clinic referral for advanced therapies and longitudinal management [^111xdtrT] [^114AyKQD].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm cardiogenic pulmonary edema and exclude mimics, stabilize with oxygen and consider NIV, use nitrates if blood pressure allows, titrate loop diuretics aggressively with awareness of renal limitations, escalate to combination diuretics or ultrafiltration if resistance occurs, monitor closely with biomarkers and clinical congestion metrics, and transition to guideline-directed disease-modifying therapy once safe, adapting for HFpEF and comorbidities throughout [^111xdtrT] [^115ZNbty] [^1133CB3u].

For pulmonary edema with renal failure, elevated BNP, elevated creatinine, palpitations, and dyspnea, prioritize **oxygen and noninvasive ventilation** for hypoxemia, and initiate **IV loop diuretics** (furosemide or torsemide) with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^115ZNbty]. Use **vasodilators** (IV nitrates or nitroprusside) if blood pressure allows to reduce preload and afterload, and consider inotropes (dobutamine or milrinone) only for low-output states or cardiogenic shock. Avoid **NSAIDs** and adjust diuretic dosing to prevent further renal injury; consider ultrafiltration if diuretic resistance occurs [^115hZA5X]. Monitor BNP trends to guide therapy and prognosis, and coordinate early cardiology and nephrology involvement for advanced therapies and disposition planning [^113L2PHH] [^114AyKQD].

---

## Initial assessment and monitoring

- **Vital signs and oxygenation**: Continuously monitor heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% with supplemental oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as needed [^116p3fuF].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Frequent checks of renal function (creatinine, BUN), electrolytes (potassium, sodium), and serial BNP/NT-proBNP to assess response and prognosis [^113L2PHH].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify arrhythmias or ischemia contributing to palpitations and decompensation [^116nScno].

- **Chest radiography**: Confirm pulmonary edema and assess cardiomegaly or pleural effusions [^116ucaUt].

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate cardiac function, ejection fraction, and structural abnormalities [^114XSrqi].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Diuretics

- **Loop diuretics**: First-line therapy (furosemide or torsemide) to relieve congestion. Start with IV furosemide 20–40 mg, titrating to effect while monitoring renal function and electrolytes [^115ZNbty].

- **Diuretic resistance**: Consider continuous infusion or combination with thiazide diuretics (e.g. metolazone) if response is inadequate [^115ZNbty].

- **Renal considerations**: Adjust dosing to avoid over-diuresis and worsening renal function; monitor closely [^111cBXXm].

---

### Vasodilators

Use **nitrates** (IV nitroglycerin or nitroprusside) if systolic blood pressure is ≥ 90 mmHg to reduce preload and afterload and improve cardiac output [^1133CB3u]. Monitor for **hypotension** and titrate carefully to avoid renal hypoperfusion [^1133CB3u].

---

### Inotropes

Reserve **inotropes** (dobutamine or milrinone) for low-output states or cardiogenic shock, with close hemodynamic monitoring [^112nhdJJ].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Morphine**: Use cautiously for severe dyspnea and anxiety, monitoring for respiratory depression and hypotension.

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Initiate or resume once hemodynamically stable to improve long-term outcomes, adjusting for renal function [^112YzKiJ].

- **Beta-blockers**: Consider once euvolemic and hemodynamically stable for chronic management [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Noninvasive ventilation (**NIV**) is indicated for severe respiratory distress or hypercapnia to improve oxygenation and reduce intubation risk [^116p3fuF]. Ultrafiltration is appropriate for **diuretic-resistant cases** or when renal function continues to worsen despite optimal therapy [^115hZA5X].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Track **daily weight**, urine output, and clinical signs of congestion (JVP, edema, rales) [^113VbQJu]. Reassess renal function and electrolytes frequently, adjusting therapy to prevent further injury [^112nhdJJ]. Use **BNP trends** to guide therapy and prognosis; a ≥ 30% reduction indicates improved outcomes [^111HTVYb].

---

## Potential complications and precautions

- **Worsening renal function**: Monitor closely and adjust diuretic therapy; consider nephrology consultation if deterioration persists [^11447zAy].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor potassium, sodium, and magnesium; correct promptly to prevent arrhythmias [^115ZNbty].

- **Hypotension**: Titrate vasodilators and diuretics carefully to avoid renal hypoperfusion [^1133CB3u].

- **Arrhythmias**: Monitor for atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias, especially with palpitations, and treat accordingly [^1148KFCJ].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Optimize **guideline-directed medical therapy** (GDMT) for heart failure, including ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, adjusting for renal function [^111xdtrT]. Coordinate **cardiology and nephrology follow-up** for ongoing management, monitoring, and consideration of advanced therapies (e.g. ultrafiltration, transplant evaluation) [^114AyKQD]. Provide patient education on medication adherence, dietary sodium restriction, daily weights, and symptom monitoring to reduce readmissions [^112nhdJJ].

---

Effective management of pulmonary edema with renal failure, elevated BNP, elevated creatinine, palpitations, and dyspnea requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, careful monitoring, and adjustment of therapy to balance symptom relief with renal protection.

### Considerations for initial therapy in the treatment of acute heart failure [^114Nz91F]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure (AHF) is challenging due to the similarity of AHF symptoms to other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Additionally, because AHF is most common in an older population, the presentation of coexistent pathologies further increases the challenge of making an accurate diagnosis and selecting the most appropriate treatment. Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of AHF can result in worse outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Rapid initiation of treatment is thus necessary for optimal disease management. Early treatment decisions for patients with AHF can be guided by risk-stratification models based on initial clinical data, including blood pressure, levels of troponin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide, and ultrasound. In this review, we discuss methods for differentiating high-risk and low-risk patients and provide guidance on how treatment decisions can be informed by risk-level assessment. Through the use of these approaches, emergency physicians can play an important role in improving patient management, preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, and lowering healthcare costs. This review differs from others published recently on the topic of treating AHF by providing a detailed examination of the clinical utility of diagnostic tools for the differentiation of dyspneic patients such as bedside ultrasound, hemodynamic changes, and interrogation of implantable cardiac devices. In addition, our clinical guidance on considerations for initial pharmacologic therapy in the undifferentiated patient is provided. It is crucial for emergency physicians to achieve an early diagnosis of AHF and initiate therapy in order to reduce morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

Description of the condition

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic dysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes (NICE 2014). Clinically, it is a syndrome in which patients have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat). The diagnosis can be difficult as many of the symptoms of heart failure are non‐discriminating so the demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis. Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is also crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve surgery for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for left ventricular systolic dysfunction, etc.) (McMurray 2012).

Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is caused by impaired left ventricular contraction, and is usually characterised by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is usually associated with impaired left ventricular relaxation, rather than left ventricular contraction, and is characterised by a normal or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (NICE 2010).

Approximately 1% to 2% of the adult population in developed countries has heart failure, with the prevalence rising to ≥ 10% among persons 70 years of age or older (McMurray 2012). The prevalence is expected to rise in future as a result of an ageing population, improved survival of people with ischaemic heart disease and more effective treatments for heart failure (Owan 2006).

Heart failure has a poor prognosis: 30% to 40% of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within a year – but thereafter the mortality is less than 10% per year. There is evidence of a trend of improved prognosis in the past 10 years. The six‐month mortality rate decreased from 26% in 1995 to 14% in 2005. Within the NHS, heart failure accounts for a total of 1 million inpatient bed‑days – 2% of all NHS inpatient bed‐days – and 5% of all emergency medical admissions to hospital. Hospital admissions because of heart failure are projected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, largely as a result of the ageing population. This is despite a progressive decline of the age‐adjusted hospitalisation rate at 1% to 1.5% per annum since 1992/1993 (NICE 2010).

THE CHALLENGES OF DIAGNOSING

Definition and Classification of

The proposed universal definition describes HF as a clinical syndrome with symptoms or signs caused by a structural or functional cardiac abnormality and corroborated by elevated natriuretic peptide levels or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion. Patients with HF may present with a wide range of symptoms, from fatigue and shortness of breath to fluid retention (pulmonary congestion, systemic venous congestion, and peripheral edema). This variability makes it challenging for clinicians to recognize HF early, especially in patients with atypical presentations or in those with comorbid conditions that can mask or mimic HF symptoms. Additionally, the symptoms of HF often overlap with those of other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, and obesity. This overlap can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Differentiating HF from other conditions requires a careful and comprehensive evaluation, often involving a combination of clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests. Diagnosing HF is inherently complex due to the multifaceted nature of the condition.

Acute heart failure in the emergency department — BNP and clinical judgment diagnostic performance (McCullough et al., 2002) is reported from a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort of ED patients with dyspnea with N = 1,538, exclusions including advanced renal failure (calculated CrCl < 15 mL/min), and 1,666 subjects screened; reviewers were blinded to emergency physicians' estimates. Using the cut point "80% clinical certainty", sensitivity was 0.49 and specificity 0.96; using the BNP cut point 100 pg/mL, sensitivity was 0.90 and specificity 0.73; AUC values were clinical judgment 0.86, BNP 0.90, and combined 0.93.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### Hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure: recognition, risk stratification, and treatment review [^112nhdJJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has emerged as a major healthcare problem. It causes approximately 3% of all hospitalizations in the United States, with the direct medical cost of these hospitalizations estimated at $18.8 billion per year. Early recognition, risk stratification, and evidence-based treatment are crucial in reducing the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this disorder. Classic signs and symptoms of ADHF, such as rales, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, may be absent at hospital presentation and, even when present, are not specific to this disorder. As a result, serum B-type natriuretic peptide level is now used to rapidly and accurately detect ADHF. Multivariate analyses have identified renal dysfunction, hypotension, advanced age, hyponatremia, and comorbidities as significant and independent mortality risk factors. Based on these factors, mortality risk can be stratified from very low to very high using published algorithms that have been validated in independent populations. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ADHF are available from both the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America. In general, an intravenous loop diuretic, either alone or in combination with a vasodilator, is recommended as initial therapy in patients with volume overload, depending on the patient's clinical status. Use of inotropic agents should be limited to the small subset of patients with low-output syndrome and significant hypotension. In any event, frequent monitoring of clinical response is essential, with subsequent therapy determined by this response. Finally, focused patient education during hospitalization may help reduce readmissions for ADHF.

### In-hospital percentage BNP reduction is highly predictive for adverse events in patients admitted for acute heart failure: the Italian RED study [^113JEQbP]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents an emerging and growing public health problem. In Europe, patients with a diagnosis of chronic HF represent about 14 million people. The prevalence is 2 to 5% in patients over the age of 65 years, with HF complications above 300,000 per year. It is a frequent cause of adult hospitalization, especially in elderly patients and carries a high mortality rate. Acute HF is defined as a rapid onset of signs (tachycardia, tachypnoea, pulmonary rales, pleural effusion, raised jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly) and symptoms (breathlessness at rest or on exercise, fatigue, tiredness, ankle swelling) of HF, resulting in the need for urgent therapy. It could present as a new HF or worsening HF in the presence of chronic HF. Although patients appear to be effectively treated during their hospital stay, HF patients often experience relapses of acute decompensation and subsequent re-hospitalization. Recent data have shown that precipitating comorbid factors (e.g. respiratory tract infections, arrhythmias, cardiac ischemia) were associated with more severe clinical outcomes independent of other prognostic factors such as kidney failure or hypertension. The best current understanding suggests that in the setting of volume expansion or pressure overload, the resulting wall stress initiates synthesis of pre-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the ventricular myocardium, although some have questioned the correlation between individual changes in blood volumes and natriuretic peptide levels. The release of BNP results in improved myocardial relaxation and serves an important regulatory role in response to acute increases in ventricular volume by opposing the vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and antidiuretic effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Natriuretic peptides, both BNP and n-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), together with other biochemical and instrumental tests, can prove useful in assessing diagnosis, severity and prognosis in patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Serial measurements of BNP could be useful not only in guiding the diagnosis of HF, but also in guiding decisions towards therapy and the evaluation of HF stabilization. There is a large body of evidence that natriuretic peptides are independent predictors of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and HF hospitalizations in both acute and chronic HF. In-hospital BNP changes with HF patients appear to be a strong independent predictor of re-hospitalization and mortality. Moreover, repeated BNP measurements in patients admitted to the hospital with ADHF could predict outcomes, even if serial BNP levels are challenged by several factors (individual variability, spontaneous fluctuations). Cheng and colleagues demonstrated that patients with a significant decrease of BNP at discharge compared with admission BNP levels had better outcomes, whereas BNP levels dropped minimally during hospitalization in patients that were re-hospitalized within 30 days. In addition, Cohen-Solal and colleagues demonstrated that patients with a 30% or higher BNP value from baseline, at follow-up had reduced mortality risk compared with those with little or no BNP decrease. It could be also useful to identify patients with ADHF who, after admission to the emergency department (ED), evidence of a reduction in BNP after acute treatment with diuretics or vasodilators. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of BNP percentage variations at 24 hours and at discharge time compared with its value at admission in the ED in demonstrating its potential predictive value for future cardiovascular events (deaths and/or re-hospitalizations).

### Renal tubular damage and worsening renal function in chronic heart failure: clinical determinants and relation to prognosis (bio-SHiFT study) [^112C6Fat]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The composite endpoint comprised cardiac death, cardiac transplantation, LVAD implantation, and hospitalization for the management of acute or worsened HF, whichever occurred first. Cardiac death was defined as death from MI or other ischemic heart disease (implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)‐10: I20‐I25), death from other heart disease including HF (I30‐I45 and I47‐I52), sudden cardiac death (I46), sudden death undefined (R96), or unwitnessed or ill‐described death (R98, R99). Hospitalization for acute or worsened HF was defined as a hospitalization for an exacerbation of HF symptoms, in combination with two of the following: BNP or NT‐proBNP > 3 times the upper limit of normal, signs of worsening HF, such as pulmonary rales, raised jugular venous pressure or peripheral edema, increased dose or intravenous administration of diuretics, or administration of positive inotropic agents. 19

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115tG5a2]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

ESC definition of advanced heart failure — criteria require that all are present despite treatment: severe and persistent symptoms of heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III [advanced] or IV); severe cardiac dysfunction defined by ≥ 1 of: LVEF ≤ 30%, isolated RV failure, nonoperable severe valve abnormalities, nonoperable severe congenital heart disease, or EF ≥ 40% with elevated natriuretic peptide levels and evidence of significant diastolic dysfunction; hospitalizations or unplanned visits in the past 12 mo for congestion requiring high-dose intravenous diuretics or diuretic combinations, low output requiring inotropes or vasoactive medications, or malignant arrhythmias; and severe impairment of exercise capacity with inability to exercise or low 6-minute walk test distance (< 300 m) or peak VO₂ (< 12–14 mL/kg/min) estimated to be of cardiac origin. Criteria 1 and 4 can be met in patients with cardiac dysfunction (as described in criterion 2) but who also have substantial limitations as a result of other conditions (eg, severe pulmonary disease, noncardiac cirrhosis, renal disease), and the therapeutic options for these patients may be more limited.

### Congestive heart failure: diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^116p3fuF]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest-radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis. Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115EoHNQ]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) admission in acute coronary syndromes — admission and length of stay "should be based on patients' risk profile and clinical stability", and patients with ACS with "continuing/ongoing angina, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or a large MI with HF, cardiogenic shock, or both, should be admitted to a CICU". Stable ACS patients "without recurrent ischemia, significant arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, or hemodynamic instability do not need CICU admission and can be admitted to an intermediate care or telemetry unit". The ACTION ICU risk score "integrates 9 variables on presentation to the ED including: signs or symptoms of HF, initial heart rate, initial SBP, initial troponin, initial serum creatinine, prior revascularization, chronic lung disease, ST-segment depression, and age > 70 years".

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^1115pM9K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B‐type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT‐proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP‐guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow‐up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in‐hospital and out‐of‐hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP‐guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all‐cause mortality using NP‐guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence).

The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP‐guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all‐cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence).

Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP‐guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence).

We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' conclusions

In patients with heart failure low‐quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP‐guided treatment while low‐quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP‐guided treatment for all‐cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all‐cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low‐quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

HFpEF mimics — noncardiac disease mimics highlight that some individuals presenting with dyspnea and/or edema may not have heart failure (HF). Noncardiovascular entities that may mimic HF include kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome, liver failure or cirrhosis, anemia, severe obesity with peripheral edema, lung disease with or without cor pulmonale, primary pulmonary hypertension, and chronic respiratory failure hypoventilation syndrome. Based on clinical presentation, evaluation may include urinalysis to assess for proteinuria, abdominal ultrasound to assess for cirrhosis, and pulmonary evaluation with imaging, spirometry, and arterial blood gas. Recognizing that not every individual with shortness of breath or edema has HF is essential.

Table 3:
Characteristics of included studies with heart failure event definitions (10 studies).

The diagnostic criteria for heart failure events in the 10 RCTs that included heart failure diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 4. Heart failure events with definitions included heart failure (three, 30%), heart failure hospitalization (five, 50%) and a composite of heart failure hospitalization and death due to heart failure/pump failure (two, 20%). Heart failure diagnostic criteria differed across RCTs with regards symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, imaging, healthcare utilization, and interventions (Table 5). Across the 10 RCTs with heart failure diagnostic criteria, symptoms were required in five RCTs (50%) including at least one of dyspnoea (five, 50%), orthopnoea (one, 10%), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (one, 10%), or fatigue (two, 20%), and signs were required in five RCTs (50%) including peripheral oedema (two, 20%), rales/crackles (four, 40%), an S3 (two, 20%), or elevated JVP (four, 40%). Two RCTs (20%) required an increase in interdialytic weight gain and one (10%) required an elevated brain natriuretic peptide as part of diagnostic criteria. Imaging showing pulmonary venous congestion was required in diagnostic criteria including interstitial oedema (four, 40%) and vascular redistribution (four, 40%) or an elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure/pulmonary wedge capillary pressure (three, 30%) or other findings on echocardiography (two, 20%). For 6 of the 10 RCTs (60%) the heart failure outcome required presentation to acute care setting (e.g. dialysis unit, emergency room, hospitalization) of which three out of six (50%) of these specified that it had to be unplanned and three out of six (50%) the primary reason for hospitalization. Intensification of medical therapy was defined as one or more of the following in these RCTs: 4 out of 10 (40%) RCTs required ultrafiltration or dialysis, 1 out of 10 (10%) RCTs required intravenous diuretics, and 1 out of 10 (10%) RCTs required a mechanical or surgical intervention. No trial distinguished heart failure from volume overload (e.g. from non-adherence with dietary sodium/fluid restriction or dialysis) and only one trial permitted heart failure to occur during an ongoing hospitalization for another condition in which heart failure became a major component of the hospitalization.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^116f11oz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute dyspnea — B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone precursor (NTproBNP) may help evaluate heart failure as the cause of dyspnea and can expedite evaluation and treatment; however, routine use of BNP in all patients with acute dyspnea is not recommended. In acute care settings such as an ED, sensitivity of BNP or NTproBNP is substantially higher than specificity and utility is greatest for ruling out heart failure when pretest probability is low to intermediate, while the utility of serial BNP testing in known heart failure is uncertain.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113nSzin]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnosis requires "symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional abnormality" corroborated by at least one of: "elevated natriuretic peptides" or "objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion". HFpEF-specific considerations include "EF 50% or greater", "Lower levels of natriuretic peptides relative to HFrEF for a given elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure", and that "Higher BMI (prevalent in HFpEF) is inversely associated with natriuretic peptide levels". When using natriuretic peptides, ambulatory thresholds are "BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL", and hospitalized thresholds are "BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL". As a complementary reference, the Framingham HF Diagnostic Criteria state that "Two or more major criteria or 1 major criterion plus 2 minor criteria are strictly required to make the diagnosis", with major criteria including "orthopnea, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, rales, S3 gallop rhythm, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly", and minor criteria including "dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal cough, ankle edema, tachycardia with heart rate over 120 beats per minute, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion".

### Brain natriuretic peptide measurement in pulmonary medicine [^116S7oAi]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Serum levels of natriuretic peptides are well established as important biomarkers in patients with cardiac disease. Less attention has been placed on the role of natriuretic peptides in patients with pulmonary conditions. In several well-defined groups of patients with pulmonary disease natriuretic peptides provide the clinician with clinically valuable information. A limitation of the interpretation of natriuretic peptides in pulmonary disease is the confounding effect of concurrent conditions such as heart failure, hypoxia, sepsis and renal failure. The present paper reviews the role of natriuretic peptides for diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis of several pulmonary disorders.

### Intrinsic acute renal failure… [^1176j9hQ]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure in patients with congestive heart failure occurs because of decreased renal blood flow. This decrease is due to hypovolemia from overdiuresis or hypervolemia that causes elevated filling pressures of the left ventricle and leads to decreased cardiac output. Patients in the former group may respond to the discontinuation of diuretics and gentle hydration. Patients in the latter group are treated with diuretics and may need inotropes and vasodilators. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be required for fluid management. Diminished renal blood flow causes ischemia in the renal parenchyma. If the ischemia is prolonged, acute tubular necrosis may develop. Early restoration of renal blood flow should shorten the ischemic time and prevent parenchymal injury. A response to the restoration of renal blood flow should occur in 24 to 48 hours. The keys to therapy are treating the underlying disorder, maintaining euvolemia and eliminating offending agents.

The microvascular diseases that cause acute renal failure are often treated with plasmapheresis and sometimes with corticosteroids. 9–11 An increasing platelet count is a marker of improvement. In patients with parturition-related acute renal failure, expedition of delivery is the initial treatment of choice. In patients with postrenal acute renal failure, treatment efforts are directed at the underlying disease. Treatments available for various causes include bladder catheterization, percutaneous nephrostomy, lithotripsy, ureteral stenting and urethral stenting. The main electrolyte disturbances in the acute setting are hyperkalemia and acidosis. The aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of hyperkalemia and the changes seen on the electrocardiogram. Intravenously administered calcium is cardioprotective and temporarily reverses the neuromuscular effects of hyperkalemia.

Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL. Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

### B-type natriuretic peptide and renal function in the diagnosis of heart failure: an analysis from the breathing not properly multinational study [^111pkSn6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and renal function are prognostic indicators of survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). However, relationships between BNP, renal function, and heart failure as an emergency diagnosis are unknown.

Methods

The Breathing Not Properly Multinational Study was a prospectively designed diagnostic test evaluation study conducted in seven centers. Of 1,586 participants who presented with acute dyspnea, 1,452 patients (91.6%) had both BNP level and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) available. Patients with an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² and those on dialysis therapy were excluded. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists who were blinded to BNP results.

Results

The final diagnosis was CHF in 715 patients (49.2%). Raw and log-log transformed correlations between BNP and eGFR values were r = -0.19 and r = -0.17 for those with CHF and r = -0.20 and r = -0.31 for those without CHF (both P < 0.0001 for r not equal 0). Mean BNP levels were 561.6 pg/mL (162.3 fmol/mL), 647.5 pg/mL (187.1 fmol/mL), 745.6 pg/mL (215.5 fmol/mL), and 850.7 pg/mL (245.8 fmol/mL) for those with CHF and 85.4 pg/mL (24.7 fmol/mL), 131.7 pg/mL (38.1 fmol/mL), 297.2 pg/mL (85.9 fmol/mL), and 285.0 pg/mL (82.3 fmol/mL) for those without CHF in eGFR categories of 90 or greater, 89 to 60, 59 to 30, and less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimum cut points for BNP were 0.91 and 70.7 pg/mL (20.4 fmol/mL), 0.90 and 104.3 pg/mL (30.1 fmol/mL), 0.81 and 201.2 pg/mL (58.1 fmol/mL), and 0.86 and 225.0 pg/mL (65.0 fmol/mL) for the eGFR categories of 90 or greater, 89 to 60, 59 to 30, and less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.

Conclusion

Renal function correlates weakly with BNP and influences the optimal cut point for BNP, particularly in those with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: results from the pre-RELAX-AHF study [^113MU8PC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Methods and results of Pre-RELAX-AHF have been detailed previously. Briefly, this study enroled patients aged ≥ 18 years who were within 16 h of presentation to hospital for AHF, with a systolic blood pressure (BP) > 125 mmHg at screening and impaired renal function [defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–75 mL/min/1.73 m²]. Acute heart failure was defined by the presence of dyspnoea at rest or with minimal exertion, pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph, and increased natriuretic peptide concentrations (BNP ≥ 350 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 1400 pg/mL) with the administration of at least 40 mg of intravenous furosemide (or equivalent loop diuretic) between presentation and screening. A systolic BP > 125 mmHg was chosen as an inclusion criterion as likely associated with the best benefit to risk ratio for a study drug such as relaxin having vasodilating and, potentially, hypotensive effects and administered at a wide range of doses in the phase II Pre-RELAX-AHF trial.

Patients were randomized within 16 h of presentation to receive placebo or 10, 30, 100, or 250 µg/kg/24 h of relaxin. Study medication was given as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 48 h. Patients were allowed to receive other therapies at the treating physician's discretion, anytime after administration was initiated. At the time of randomization, IV nitrates were only allowed if the patient's systolic BP was > 150 mmHg at screening. The Pre-RELAX-AHF study was approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities and Ethics Committees prior to patient enrolment, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before study-specific procedures were performed.

### Natriuretic peptides in heart failure: should therapy be guided by BNP levels? [^112daB2p]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Testing for natriuretic peptide markers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), has emerged as an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF. However, questions remain regarding the potential role for natriuretic peptides to guide therapy in patients with HF. In this Review, we address the underlying assumptions and the existing evidence supporting a natriuretic-peptide-guided approach to the outpatient management of HF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

### Relaxin for the treatment of patients with acute heart failure (pre-RELAX-AHF): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding phase IIb study [^111mM5pT]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most patients admitted for acute heart failure have normal or increase blood pressure. Relaxin is a natural human peptide that affects multiple vascular control pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms of benefit for such patients. We assessed the dose response of relaxin's effect on symptom relief, other clinical outcomes, and safety.

Methods

In a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, 234 patients with acute heart failure, dyspnoea, congestion on chest radiograph, and increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of BNP, mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency, and systolic blood pressure greater than 125 mm Hg were recruited from 54 sites in eight countries and enrolled within 16 h of presentation. Patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner via a telephone-based interactive voice response system, to standard care plus 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 62) or relaxin 10 microg/kg (n = 40), 30 microg/kg (n = 43), 100 microg/kg (n = 39), or 250 microg/kg (n = 50) per day. Several clinical endpoints were explored to assess whether intravenous relaxin should be pursued in larger studies of acute heart failure, to identify an optimum dose, and to help to assess endpoint selection and power calculations. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00520806.

Findings

In the modified intention-to-treat population, 61 patients were assessed in the placebo group, 40 in the relaxin 10 microg/kg per day group, 42 in the relaxin 30 microg/kg per day group, 37 in the relaxin 100 microg/kg per day group, and 49 in the relaxin 250 microg/kg per day group. Dyspnoea improved with relaxin 30 microg/kg compared with placebo, as assessed by Likert scale (17 of 42 patients [40%] moderately or markedly improved at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h vs 14 of 61 [23%]; p = 0.044) and visual analogue scale through day 14 (8214 mm x h [SD 8712] vs 4622 mm x h [9003]; p = 0.053). Length of stay was 10.2 days (SD 6.1) for relaxin-treated patients versus 12.0 days (7.3) for those given placebo, and days alive out of hospital were 47.9 (10.1) versus 44.2 (14.2). Cardiovascular death or readmission due to heart or renal failure at day 60 was reduced with relaxin (2.6% [95% CI 0.4–16.8] vs 17.2% [9.6–29.6]; p = 0.053). The number of serious adverse events was similar between groups.

Interpretation

When given to patients with acute heart failure and normal-to-increased blood pressure, relaxin was associated with favourable relief of dyspnoea and other clinical outcomes, with acceptable safety.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

### Advances in congestive heart failure management in the intensive care unit: B-type natriuretic peptides in evaluation of acute heart failure [^114jp3Wn]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Circulating concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the aminoterminal fragment (NT-proBNP) of its prohormone (proBNP) are increased in congestive heart failure in proportion to the severity of symptoms, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac filling pressures. Following the introduction of rapid, automated assays for determination of BNP and NT-proBNP, these peptides are increasingly used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

Objective

To review studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of BNP and NT-proBNP, with special emphasis on their performance as indicators of acute heart failure in the intensive care unit.

Results

In patients presenting with acute dyspnea, both BNP and NT-proBNP are accurate indicators of acute heart failure and provide prognostic information above and beyond conventional risk markers. Increased plasma levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are not specific for heart failure and may be influenced by a variety of cardiac and noncardiac conditions commonly seen in the intensive care unit, including myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, sepsis, shock, anemia, renal failure, hypoxia, acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of BNP and NT-proBNP as indicators of acute heart failure depends on the clinical setting. In the intensive care unit, particular caution should be used in the interpretation of elevated BNP and NT-proBNP levels.

Heart failure diagnostic evaluation — laboratory testing and natriuretic peptides: Thyroid-function tests should be measured; a fasting transferrin saturation is useful to screen for hemochromatosis and magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to confirm iron overload; screening for human immunodeficiency virus should be considered in patients who are at high risk; assays for connective tissue diseases and for pheochromocytoma should be performed if suspected; and serum titers of Chagas disease antibodies should be checked in nonischemic cardiomyopathy with travel or immigration from an endemic region. Elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been associated with reduced LVEF, LVH, elevated LV filling pressures, and acute MI and ischemia and are sensitive to age, sex, weight, and renal function; elevated levels lend support to a diagnosis of abnormal ventricular function or hemodynamics causing symptomatic heart failure. Trials suggest utility in the urgent-care setting to differentiate dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes and suggest that use may reduce both the time to hospital discharge and the cost of treatment, but BNP levels tend to be less elevated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction than in heart failure with low ejection fraction, are lower in obese patients, and may be elevated meaningfully in women and in people over 60 years of age who do not have heart failure; elevations may lend weight to a suspected diagnosis or trigger consideration of heart failure when unknown but should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude the presence of heart failure.

### An 88-year-old man with syncope and an alternating axis [^112MQaD9]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An 88-year-old man, admitted to the emergency room (ER) after three episodes of syncope within 1day, reported a precursory of syndrome of light-headedness with rapid palpitations that led to an abrupt loss of consciousness. After undergoing percutaneous and surgical revascularisation, he started complaining of chest and back discomfort for the past 20years and searching for help from Chinese medicine, Fuzi. He had history of chronic renal failure and heart failure, but denied neither taking digitalis nor having family history related to sudden death. On arrival, heart rate was 150bpm and blood pressure (BP) by cuff was 91/81mmHg (non-invasive BP could not be accurately obtained during tachycardia) plus oedema on both lower extremities. There were diffuse crackles and indistinct heart sounds on auscultation. The admission ECG was performed in the ER (figure 1). His serum creatinine was 139.7mmol/L, serum K(+) was 4.7mmol/L, N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide was highly elevated (12000pg/mL) and troponin I was negative.

Question

What is the most likely diagnosis suggested based on the patient's ECG and history? Aconite poisoningDigitalis toxicityCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS).

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing in heart failure — guideline-directed uses and evidence are as follows: 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA states that in patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (Class I, Evidence A), in patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (Class I, Evidence A), and in patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (Class I, Evidence A); it also notes that in patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP-based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF (Class IIa, Evidence B-R), and in patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (Class IIa, Evidence B-NR). 2021 ESC recommends that plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides are recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF to rule out the diagnosis, with elevated concentrations supporting a diagnosis of HF, being useful for prognostication, and potentially guiding further cardiac investigation (Class I, Evidence B). 2017 JCS/JHFS indicates use to confirm the diagnosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the severity of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the prognosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), monitor the efficacy of HF treatment (Class I, Evidence B), and screen patients susceptible to HF (Class IIa, Evidence C).

Practical use of ACE inhibitors — selection, co-therapy, and cautions: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction with reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or have been shown to be unable to tolerate these drugs, and treatment with an ACEI should not be delayed until resistance to other drugs is demonstrated. In general, ACEIs are used together with a beta-blocker, and ACEIs should not be prescribed without diuretics in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention. ACEIs are often preferred over ARBs or direct-acting vasodilators because of the greater experience and weight of evidence in support of their effectiveness. Patients should not be given an ACEI if they have experienced life-threatening adverse reactions (angioedema or anuric renal failure) during previous exposure or if they are pregnant. ACEIs should be taken with caution when very low systemic blood pressure is present (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), when serum creatinine is markedly increased (greater than 3 mg per dL), with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or when serum potassium is elevated (greater than 5.5 mmol per liter). Treatment with an ACEI should not be initiated in hypotensive patients who are at immediate risk of cardiogenic shock; such patients should first receive other forms of treatment for HF and then be re-evaluated for ACE inhibition once stability has been achieved.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Perspective for the noncardiologist — timely diagnosis and referrals: The universal definition is intended to support noncardiologists in timely diagnosis and management. Key points include to "optimally identify and treat patients at risk for HF to prevent or delay the development of HF", to recognize that pre-HF patients such as asymptomatic patients with elevated natriuretic peptides will likely require cardiology referral to prevent progression, to ensure that diagnosis and timely treatment are not missed or delayed in symptomatic patients, and that patients with elevated natriuretic peptides, evidence of congestion/elevated filling pressures, or advanced HF would be considered for referral to HF specialists.

1.6.1.2 Nesiritide — mechanism, hemodynamic effects, renal considerations, and evidence: Nesiritide, a recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), relaxes smooth muscle cells leading to venous and arterial vasodilation with increased cardiac output without direct positive inotropy, and compared with intravenous nitroglycerin it produced faster relief of dyspnea with a more pronounced reduction in elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) sustained over 24 hours; however, despite BNP's natriuretic and diuretic effects, in severe advanced heart failure up to 50% of patients seem to be resistant, kidney benefit is not proven and may worsen, hypotension is the most common side effect requiring caution and close blood pressure monitoring, and in a randomized open-label pilot of 210 patients outpatient serial infusions did not increase cardiovascular or renal adverse events but, despite investigator-assessed clinical status improvement, there were no statistically significant differences in deaths or hospitalizations, and there are no compelling data to recommend long-term intermittent use in-hospital or out-of-hospital.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^116Eo8Xp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A chest X-ray can help distinguish an ECOPD from acute HF, with cardiomegaly supporting structural heart damage and HF likely present if there is pulmonary edema. The best laboratory markers of HF are elevation of natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), with thresholds supportive of acute HF, consistent with European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on HF, shown in Figure 3. Importantly, natriuretic peptides are commonly elevated in patients with stable COPD or pneumonia and increase further in patients with ECOPD even without acute HF. As such, higher thresholds are needed to accurately diagnose concomitant acute HF and ECOPD. More informative is the presence of low peptide concentrations, which have excellent negative predictive value for acute HF, even in patients with an ECOPD. Patients with elevated natriuretic peptides during an ECOPD have a worse prognosis, including a risk of death. Finally, point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate ECOPD from acute HF, although more research is required to establish their impact on health outcome benefits. A diagnostic algorithm to evaluate a patient with suspected acute HF is shown in Figure 3.

Recommendations are on the basis of the most recent European and American Guidelines on heart failure. *The thresholds for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and BNP are intended for the diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) and may need correction with age. Thresholds for new onset stable HF are much lower (i.e. NT-proBNP > 125 pg/ml and BNP > 35 pg/ml) and should be used outside the context of an exacerbation of COPD. Note that the presence of COPD may raise these values. Please see text for further details.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117Xs6Ko]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — scope and diagnostic definition are outlined, noting that heart failure (HF) carries a lifetime risk at age 40 of approximately 20%, and that HFpEF continues to rise and now accounts for more than 50% of HF cases with outcomes comparable to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while often under-recognized with substantial resource utilization. Per the Universal Definition of HF, diagnosis requires symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and at least 1 of the following: elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HFpEF is defined as a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, whereas EFs between 40% and 50% are noted as HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The document also notes that HFpEF is not synonymous with diastolic dysfunction and lists pivotal issues to address in HFpEF care, including how to approach a person with shortness of breath, overcome diagnostic dilemmas and identify a need for further testing, rule out mimics to avoid missed diagnosis, manage comorbidities and care complexities, initiate and optimize GDMTs, determine when and why to refer to a cardiologist or HF specialist, improve access to care, and recognize sex-specific differences in diagnosis and care management.

### Acute renal failure… [^11447zAy]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure in patients with congestive heart failure occurs because of decreased renal blood flow. This decrease is due to hypovolemia from overdiuresis or hypervolemia that causes elevated filling pressures of the left ventricle and leads to decreased cardiac output. Patients in the former group may respond to the discontinuation of diuretics and gentle hydration. Patients in the latter group are treated with diuretics and may need inotropes and vasodilators. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be required for fluid management. Diminished renal blood flow causes ischemia in the renal parenchyma. If the ischemia is prolonged, acute tubular necrosis may develop. Early restoration of renal blood flow should shorten the ischemic time and prevent parenchymal injury. A response to the restoration of renal blood flow should occur in 24 to 48 hours. The keys to therapy are treating the underlying disorder, maintaining euvolemia and eliminating offending agents.

The microvascular diseases that cause acute renal failure are often treated with plasmapheresis and sometimes with corticosteroids. 9–11 An increasing platelet count is a marker of improvement. In patients with parturition-related acute renal failure, expedition of delivery is the initial treatment of choice. In patients with postrenal acute renal failure, treatment efforts are directed at the underlying disease. Treatments available for various causes include bladder catheterization, percutaneous nephrostomy, lithotripsy, ureteral stenting and urethral stenting. The main electrolyte disturbances in the acute setting are hyperkalemia and acidosis. The aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of hyperkalemia and the changes seen on the electrocardiogram. Intravenously administered calcium is cardioprotective and temporarily reverses the neuromuscular effects of hyperkalemia.

Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL. Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

End-of-life care

When a patient with HF is approaching end of life, symptom control overrides treatment with potential prognostic impact. Deteriorating renal function is common. Diuretics should be titrated to prevent distress from fluid overload, irrespective of renal function. If there is symptomatic hypotension, discontinuation of RAAS blockade is appropriate.
Higher doses of diuretics than are commonly used are needed to treat congestion in the fluid overloaded patient.
A decline in renal function is not an indication to reduce diuretic dose if the patient remains congested.
Consider stopping RAAS inhibitors towards the end of life.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — patients with renal insufficiency in heart failure: Patients with heart failure (HF) frequently have impaired renal function and may show an impaired response to diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) with increased risk of adverse effects during digitalis; renal function may worsen during treatment with diuretics or ACEIs, although such changes are frequently short-lived, generally asymptomatic, and reversible. Most patients tolerate mild to moderate renal impairment and changes in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine are generally clinically insignificant and can usually be managed without withdrawal of needed HF drugs, but if serum creatinine increases to more than 3 mg per dL, renal insufficiency can severely limit efficacy and enhance toxicity of established treatments; in patients with a serum creatinine greater than 5 mg per dL, hemofiltration or dialysis may be needed to control fluid retention, minimize risk of uremia, and allow response to and tolerance of standard HF therapies.

### Peripheral edema: evaluation and management in primary care [^112haf2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema is a common clinical sign that may indicate numerous pathologies. As a sequela of imbalanced capillary hemodynamics, edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial compartment. The chronicity and laterality of the edema guide evaluation. Medications (e.g., antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones) can contribute to edema. Evaluation should begin with obtaining a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function testing, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio. Validated decision rules, such as the Wells and STOP-Bang (snoring, tired, observed, pressure, body mass index, age, neck size, gender) criteria, can guide decision-making regarding the possibility of venous thromboembolic disease and obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. Acute unilateral lower-extremity edema warrants immediate evaluation for deep venous thrombosis with a d-dimer test or compression ultrasonography. For patients with chronic bilateral lower-extremity edema, duplex ultrasonography with reflux can help diagnose chronic venous insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary edema or elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels should undergo echocardiography to assess for heart failure. Lymphedema is often a clinical diagnosis; lymphoscintigraphy can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear. Treatment of edema is specific to the etiology. Diuretics are effective but should be used only for systemic causes of edema. Ruscus extract and horse chestnut seed demonstrate moderate-quality evidence to improve edema from chronic venous insufficiency. Compression therapy is effective for most causes of edema.

### The interpretation of brain natriuretic peptide in critical care patients; will it ever be useful? [^112BRGxM]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

The measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is recommended for the diagnosis of decompensated heart failure, the prognosis of chronic heart failure is worse if BNP is increased and studies suggest that BNP is useful to guide therapy. A study by Di Somma and colleagues adds to the body of evidence showing that patients with a marked decrease in BNP concentrations during their hospital admission are less likely to be readmitted with a further adverse cardiac event than patients in whom BNP fails to decrease. However, the wider interpretation of BNP concentrations in critically ill patients with other conditions remains uncertain.

### Management of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^114bhNcn]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical examination should focus on examination of radial pulse rhythm and rate and blood pressure (BP). Signs of volume overload (raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral oedema and pulmonary crepitations) may not be obvious in early stages of HFpEF. Cardiac auscultation may reveal systolic flow murmurs or murmurs from valvular abnormalities. Assessment of body build with weight, body mass index and presence of central obesity is essential. While there are no specific ECG findings to indicate HFpEF, ECG is recommended to detect AF and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

First-line laboratory blood tests should include NP, full blood count, ferritin and transferrin saturation to exclude anaemia, which may precipitate symptoms of breathlessness. Renal function including urea, creatinine, electrolytes and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and HbA1c must be checked. Liver function tests, thyroid function tests and lipid profile are useful in assessing the risk of metabolic syndrome. Although NP levels have been shown to have high negative predictive value in excluding HF (when levels are < 125 pg/mL for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and < 35 pg/mL for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as per ESC guidelines and for UK practitioners NT-proBNP level less than 400 pg/mL as per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines), approximately 20% of patients with HFpEF will have normal NP levels. The reason for normal NP levels in HFpEF is due to the mechanism in which NPs are released. NPs are released due to high LV diastolic wall stress. Bearing in mind that the LV diastolic wall stress is inversely proportional to the wall thickness, in cases with mild LVH (which is common in HFpEF), the effect of diastolic LV wall stress may be diminished and NP may not be released. In contrast to HFpEF, the LV diastolic wall stress in HFrEF more commonly triggers release of NP in patients with dilated LV and thinned myocardial walls. Another reason for NP levels below the cut-off thresholds is obesity. It is worthwhile noting that NP levels can be raised due to a variety of cardiac and non-CV causes other than HF. Pathological processes leading to the increased LV diastolic stress or myocardial injury, resulting from acute ischaemia, inflammation or iatrogenic causes (eg, cardioversion), can cause high levels of NP. Non-cardiac conditions can increase serum NP via indirect mechanisms such as impaired metabolism, low creatinine clearance, systemic hypoxia, starvation and dehydration. Figure 3 highlights the cardiac and non-cardiac causes of raised NP levels.

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^1174ZNjU]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Since any therapeutic plan has the potential to unexpectedly induce or exacerbate concomitant disorders, it is noteworthy that there was no increase in overall hospitalizations and no deterioration in renal function as gauged by serum creatinine levels, with NP-guided treatment. It seems unlikely, therefore, that unexpected harm results from the implementation of NP-guided treatment.

Some limitations in our study should be noted. There were differences in study design particularly regarding BNP/NT-proBNP targets, although these did not produce heterogeneity in key results as tested in this meta-analysis. With respect to application of the NP-guided strategy, use of a single, low target level of BNP or NT-proBNP may provide more opportunities to up-titrate therapy. Our meta-analysis, however, cannot provide firm advice on this matter. Individual patient data were not available from two published studies;, however, it is unlikely that inclusion of individual data from these or other unpublished studies would have altered the overall findings of this meta-analysis. Individual data for adverse events were not available for analysis from any of the studies. However, published original reports of each individual study did not identify any significant difference in adverse events between study groups. In a subset of the current study cohort, as reported above, changes in renal function, as measured by plasma creatinine levels, did not differ between the two study groups.

To date, only NP-guided therapy has been widely tested in randomized controlled studies. However, a wide range of biomarkers reflecting different aspects of heart failure pathophysiology — including markers of renal dysfunction, fibrosis, myocardial necrosis, and inflammation — provide risk stratification that is incremental to NPs and could potentially play a role in guiding treatment. – Further study is certainly needed to evaluate multi-marker strategies to guide HF therapy.

In summary, this robust individual patient meta-analysis indicates that for patients aged < 75 years with chronic heart failure most of whom had impaired left ventricular systolic function, NP-guided treatment reduced all-cause mortality compared with clinically guided therapy. This strategy also reduces hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular disorders, irrespective of age. Therefore, we propose that NP-guided treatment should be considered in such patients, although a well-powered, large scale, randomized, and blinded study which includes adequate numbers of heart failure patients with both reduced and preserved EF would provide reassurance in this regard.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^1162zeGo]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Mechanistic and prognostic insights across heart failure stages — determinants of natriuretic peptide release and outcome thresholds. A common misconception is that concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP mainly reflect congestion in all domains; during stabilized disease, the main determinant of BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations is transmural wall stress, helping explain prognostication in stage A or B HF and strong associations with cardiac remodeling in stage C HF. Among acute HF presentations, following diuretic therapy, robust NT-proBNP reduction is strongly linked to subsequent favorable courses, whereas in stage C HFrEF without exaggerated congestion, early decrease in NT-proBNP to < 1000 pg/mL following adjustment by guideline-directed medical therapy was linked to a 74% reduction in subsequent cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization and greater improvement in LVEF by 1 year with larger NT-proBNP reductions.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure — evidence summary indicates limited benefit for target-based reduction: Results of the PRIMA II trial demonstrated that NT-proBNP–guided therapy targeting an NT-proBNP reduction of ≥ 30% did not improve 6-month clinical outcomes. Observational data reported that 37%–47% of patients did not achieve the targeted BNP reduction of 30% despite inpatient therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, and failure to reach the targeted threshold for BNP improvement was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality. In a recent study, 44% of admitted patients did not achieve the 30% target BNP threshold and were at significantly increased risk for 180-day mortality compared to patients whose BNP levels responded to treatment.

### Which heart failure patients profit from natriuretic peptide guided therapy? A meta-analysis from individual patient data of randomized trials [^117RSL86]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Previous analyses suggest that heart failure (HF) therapy guided by (N-terminal pro-)brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) might be dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction, age and co-morbidities, but the reasons remain unclear.

Methods and Results

To determine interactions between (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and HF with reduced [ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45%; HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), n = 1731] vs. preserved EF [EF > 45%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), n = 301] and co-morbidities (hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular insult, peripheral vascular disease) on outcome, individual patient data (n = 2137) from eight NT-proBNP guidance trials were analysed using Cox-regression with multiplicative interaction terms. Endpoints were mortality and admission because of HF. Whereas in HFrEF patients (NT-pro)BNP-guided compared with symptom-guided therapy resulted in lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.97, P = 0.03] and fewer HF admissions (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67–0.97, P = 0.02), no such effect was seen in HFpEF (mortality: HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.76–1.96, P = 0.41; HF admissions HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.67–1.53, P = 0.97; interactions P < 0.02). Age (74 ± 11 years) interacted with treatment strategy allocation independently of EF regarding mortality (P = 0.02), but not HF admission (P = 0.54). The interaction of age and mortality was explained by the interaction of treatment strategy allocation with co-morbidities. In HFpEF, renal failure provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; increased risk of (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy if renal failure present), whereas in HFrEF patients, the presence of at least two of the following co-morbidities provided strongest interaction (P < 0.01; (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy beneficial only if none or one of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular insult, or peripheral vascular disease present). (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy was harmful in HFpEF patients without hypertension (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

The benefits of therapy guided by (NT-pro)BNP were present in HFrEF only. Co-morbidities seem to influence the response to (NT-pro)BNP-guided therapy and may explain the lower efficacy of this approach in elderly patients.

### Acute respiratory failure in the elderly: etiology, emergency diagnosis and prognosis [^116kPbeu]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Our objectives were to determine the causes of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in elderly patients and to assess the accuracy of the initial diagnosis by the emergency physician, and that of the prognosis.

Method

In this prospective observational study, patients were included if they were admitted to our emergency department, aged 65 years or more with dyspnea, and fulfilled at least one of the following criteria of ARF: respiratory rate at least 25 minute-1; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) 70 mmHg or less, or peripheral oxygen saturation 92% or less in breathing room air; arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO₂) ≥ 45 mmHg, with pH ≤ 7.35. The final diagnoses were determined by an expert panel from the completed medical chart.

Results

A total of 514 patients (aged (mean ± standard deviation) 80 ± 9 years) were included. The main causes of ARF were cardiogenic pulmonary edema (43%), community-acquired pneumonia (35%), acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease (32%), pulmonary embolism (18%), and acute asthma (3%); 47% had more than two diagnoses. In-hospital mortality was 16%. A missed diagnosis in the emergency department was noted in 101 (20%) patients. The accuracy of the diagnosis of the emergency physician ranged from 0.76 for cardiogenic pulmonary edema to 0.96 for asthma. An inappropriate treatment occurred in 162 (32%) patients, and lead to a higher mortality (25% versus 11%; p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, inappropriate initial treatment (odds ratio 2.83, p < 0.002), hypercapnia > 45 mmHg (odds ratio 2.79, p < 0.004), clearance of creatinine < 50 mL minute⁻¹ (odds ratio 2.37, p < 0.013), elevated NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide (odds ratio 2.06, p < 0.046), and clinical signs of acute ventilatory failure (odds ratio 1.98, p < 0.047) were predictive of death.

Conclusion

Inappropriate initial treatment in the emergency room was associated with increased mortality in elderly patients with ARF.

### Elevations of B-type natriuretic peptide in pulmonary embolism: a case series [^114LL3Bi]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The use of B-type natriuretic peptide to diagnose congestive heart failure is becoming more frequent and widespread. We report five patients recently seen at our hospital who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and noted to have elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels. We caution that elevations of B-type natriuretic peptide may in some patients have the potential to mislead clinicians if the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is not considered.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^115ZNbty]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure:

- **Definition**: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Pathophysiology**: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- **Disease course**: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^111Qjoe5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Hypertensive heart failure: patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes [^115CfYAq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common, poorly characterized manifestation of hypertensive emergency. We sought to describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients with severe hypertension complicated by AHF.

Methods and Results

The observational retrospective Studying the Treatment of Acute hypertension (STAT) registry records data on emergency department and hospitalized patients receiving intravenous therapy for blood pressure (BP) greater than 180/110 mm Hg in 25 US hospitals. A subset of patients with HF was defined as pulmonary edema on chest x-ray (CXR) or an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level (BNP > 500 or NTproBNP > 900 pg/mL) in patients with creatinine level 2.5 mg/dL or less. Remaining STAT patients, after excluding those with a primary neurologic diagnosis, constitute the non-HF cohort. An adverse composite outcome was defined as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay more than 1 week, or death within 30 days. Of 1199 patients, 302 (25.2%) had AHF. Acute HF patients and non-AHF patients were similar in age, sex, and overall mortality, but AHF patients were more commonly African American, with a history of HF, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior hypertension admissions. Heart failure patients had higher creatinine and natriuretic peptide levels but lower ejection fraction. They were more likely admitted to the ICU; receive electrocardiograms, bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation, and CXRs; and be readmitted within 90 days. Finally, BP decreases lower than 120 mm Hg within 12 hours were associated with an increased rate of the composite adverse outcome.

Conclusions

Acute HF as a manifestation of hypertensive emergency is common, more likely in African Americans, and requires more clinical resources than patients with non-HF-related severe hypertension. Accurate BP control is critical, as declines less than 120 mm Hg were associated with increased adverse event rates.

3 Results

3.1 Study Selection and Baseline Characteristics

The study selection is demonstrated in Figure 1. The initial search identified 761 studies (PubMed [n = 228], Embase [n = 438], and Cochrane [n = 95]). After title and abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 15 studies remained to be fully reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 9 RCTs were included, comprising 3992 patients, of whom 2007 (50.29%) were treated according to NT‐proBNP guided. According to the eligibility criteria, six studies were excluded: one due to addressing a different research question, four due to overlapping populations, and one for not reporting the outcomes of interest. A full description of the eligibility criteria per study can be found in Table S1. The included subjects had a mean age of 68.79 years and were mostly male (62.8%). The follow‐up ranged between 4 and 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Study characteristics are in Table 1 and Table S2. Additionally, each study's composite outcome definition and target BNP for optimization criteria for the NP‐guided group can be found in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation… [^116nScno]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with cardiac disease, a history of symptoms consistent with heart failure should be elicited. Physical Examination The physical examination should start with a review of vital signs followed by an examination of the relevant body systems based on suspected diagnosis, including nasal and sinus tracts, oropharynx, neck, thorax, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, and skin. Pulsus paradoxus is associated with severe COPD, asthma, large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism, and subacute cardiac tamponade.

23 Neck examination may reveal a shift of the trachea, adenopathy, jugular venous distention, or an enlarged thyroid gland causing tissue congestion or mass effect giving rise to the sensation of dyspnea. Cyanosis, wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and distant heart sounds are consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, as are use of accessory muscles for respiration, a barrel chest, and decreased breath sounds with pursed lip breathing. Rales, a positive hepatojugular reflex, hepatomegaly, and an S3 gallop, ascites, and jugular venous distention suggest heart failure as an underlying cause. An irregular rhythm on auscultation may indicate arrhythmias causative of chronic dyspnea. Treatment After the underlying cause of dyspnea has been identified, the goals are to initiate appropriate treatment, to optimize recovery, and to improve subjective and measurable symptoms of dyspnea.

Chronic dyspnea is a set of symptoms rather than a specific disease; therefore, appropriate treatments should be directed at the underlying cause. Certain treatments directly addressing symptoms should also be considered. Supplemental oxygen has long been used in patients with COPD with severe resting hypoxia (less than 89% O. In palliative care settings, oral or nebulized opioids for dyspnea are an option; they should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. In cases of severe lung or heart disease, response to medical intervention for dyspnea can be monitored using the six-minute walk test.

Evaluation of AEs indicative of heart failure

CV, renal, and pulmonary system signs and symptoms that could possibly indicate myocardial damage and/or heart failure were evaluated across the SAD, MAD, MAD T2D, and tQTc studies. Treatment-emergent CV system AEs of conduction disorder (placebo, fasting), orthostatic hypotension (2.5 mg, fasting), and syncope (2.5 mg, fasting) each occurred in 1 participant in the SAD study and were not dose related. Treatment-emergent general AEs of chest pain (SAD: n = 1: 75 mg, fasted), fatigue (SAD: n = 1: 20 mg, fed; MAD: n = 2: 200 mg), and peripheral edema (MAD: n = 1: 40 mg) were infrequent and not consistent across all studies. No renal (e.g. increased serum creatinine or decreased creatinine clearance) or pulmonary system (e.g. dyspnea, orthopnea, shortness of breath) treatment-emergent AEs suggestive of heart failure or myocardial damage were reported in any of the studies.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ndxoa]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

In this meta‐analysis of 9 RCTs including 3992 patients with decompensated HF, NP‐guided therapy showed no consistent benefit over usual care in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, or improving quality of life. A significant advantage was observed only in time to all‐cause mortality, suggesting time‐dependent analysis may offer additional insight into long‐term outcomes. However, this was not mirrored in other endpoints, and the overall benefit remains uncertain. Further well‐designed trials using standardized protocols and time‐to‐event analyses are needed to clarify the role of NP‐guided therapy in the era of modern HF treatment.

### Considerations for initial therapy in the treatment of acute heart failure [^11521wyG]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

AHF risk stratification

Patients with AHF are a heterogeneous group, often with comorbidities requiring different levels of treatment. The use of risk-stratification tools can improve treatment decisions. For example, early identification of low-risk patients who are candidates for discharge or treatment in an observation unit can prevent unnecessary hospital admissions and reduce costs. Patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes include those with a history of hospitalizations for AHF, markedly elevated BNP (> 1000 pg/ml), or sodium concentration < 136 mmol/l. Other parameters have been stratified by dichotomous cutoff points that, if exceeded, are associated with increased risk of short-term death, including BUN ≥ 43 mg/dl, creatinine ≥ 2.75 mg/dl, systolic blood pressure (BP) < 115 mmHg, or troponin level above the 99th percentile. If these parameters are exceeded, patients may be candidates for aggressive treatment in an ICU. Risk-stratification models can help guide treatment decisions, but their implementation is limited. In the most robust study to date, in-hospital mortality was predicted in 65,275 patients with AHF who were differentiated into risk groups based on BUN, systolic BP, and creatinine. In-hospital mortality was significantly greater in high-risk (23.6%) versus low-risk (1.8%) patients (odds ratio (OR): 12.9; 95% CI: 10.4–15.9; P < 0.001); the effect of elevated BUN, low systolic BP, and high creatinine levels on in-hospital mortality has been clearly established. However, this model has limited generalizability because it was derived from retrospective data; only 39 predictor variables were evaluated, and inpatient mortality was the only outcome measured.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111xdtrT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — most patients admitted with heart failure (HF) have clinical evidence of congestion without apparent hypoperfusion, and although right- and left-sided cardiac filling pressures are usually proportional in decompensation of chronic HF with low EF, up to 1 in 4 patients have a mismatch between right- and left-sided filling pressures. Elevated natriuretic peptides can help identify HF in the urgent care setting but with less utility in certain situations, including decreased sensitivity with obesity and HFpEF and decreased specificity in the setting of sepsis. Elevated serum lactate levels may indicate hypoperfusion and impending cardiogenic shock.

### Need for a unified decision-making tool for ultrafiltration therapy in heart failure; call for action [^115hZA5X]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Although ultrafiltration portends several theoretical advantages over the standard therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, it might not be the optimal treatment for all patients presenting with an episode of decompensation. It is not yet clear how to prospectively identify the subset of patients that would benefit from this therapeutic modality. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying acute decompensated heart failure, early ultrafiltration therapy can be an appropriate initial management strategy for those patients with diuretic resistance whose associated renal dysfunction is related to hemodynamic changes rather than a structural abnormality. In the absence of widely accepted consensus guidelines, ultrafiltration use is currently subject to considerable variations among physicians. A clinical tool (eg, a scoring system) that is based on the individual patient's characteristics is therefore needed to prospectively identify the appropriate candidates for this therapy. Using this system is likely to portend better outcomes while helping to avoid unnecessary exposure to potential risks of extracorporeal therapies.

### Acute heart failure: clinical presentation, one-year mortality and prognostic factors [^1179S2Hz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Acute heart failure (HF) is a common but ill-defined clinical entity. We describe patients hospitalised with acute HF in regard of clinical presentation, mortality, and risk factors for an unfavourable outcome.

Methods and Results

We conducted a prospective study including 312 consecutive patients from two European centers hospitalised with acute HF, defined as new onset or worsening of symptoms and signs of HF within 7 days. The mean age was 73 years and 56% were men. Twenty-eight percent had de-novo acute HF and 72% a decompensation of chronic HF. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the most frequent underlying heart disease, elevated blood pressure > 150 mmHg and acute ischemia being the most important triggers. Four percent of the patients had cardiogenic shock, 13% presented with pulmonary edema. LV-EF was < 35%, 35–50% and > 50% in 35%, 32% and 33% of the patients, respectively. ICU-treatment was necessary in 39% of the patients. Thirty-day mortality (11%) was increased in the presence of shock or elevated troponin T levels. Twelve-month all-cause mortality (29%) increased in the presence of shock, left ventricular dysfunction, renal insufficiency, CHD, and age.

Conclusions

This prospective study shows that despite modern treatment, morbidity and mortality of patients hospitalised with acute HF remain high.

### Rapid and life-threatening heart failure induced by pazopanib [^112NW3YU]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Initial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status. On physical examination, he was dyspnoeic and tachypnoeic with RR of 40 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. His HR ranged between 140 and 150 bpm and his BP was 96/53 mm Hg. He was in respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences but alert and following commands.

Data abstraction

Two reviewers (L.P. A.B.) independently extracted data from each study using the primary report, supplementary material, protocol, and registration if necessary. Abstracted data elements included the study author, journal, design (parallel, crossover, other) population (haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, both), intervention, comparator (placebo, usual care, active), blinding (blinded, open-label, unclear), country, sample size, follow-up duration, whether the primary outcome was statistically significant defined by a P value < 0.05 (yes, no, unclear), and funding (non-industry, industry, both, unclear). We then focused on RCTs with heart failure events as primary, secondary, or composite outcomes. The following data elements were abstracted for heart failure events as primary, secondary, or composite outcomes (e.g. heart failure death with other nonfatal CV events or a hospitalization for heart failure with other fatal or nonfatal CV events or mortality), event rates, diagnostic criteria including symptoms (dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, oedema), and New York Heart Association stage, signs (oedema, elevated jugular venous pulse, crackles/rales, the presence of a S3), imaging abnormalities (chest X-ray, ultrasound echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, left heart catheterization), cardiac biomarker abnormalities (brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide), planned or unplanned healthcare utilization (clinic, dialysis unit, emergency room, hospital), the need for dialysis/ultrafiltration, any additional treatments (e.g. increase in oral diuretics, intravenous diuretics, inotropes, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation, mechanical circulatory support), whether an alternative diagnosis could be present, and whether adjudication was performed. We did not include any tertiary outcomes or safety outcomes that were not primary or secondary outcomes including individual adverse events that may be related to heart failure (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, and fatigue). We did not consider the source of data (e.g. case report forms, supporting documents, linkages with registries/administrative databases). All disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (D.C.).

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1148KFCJ]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects related to angiotensin suppression in heart failure (HF) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy include hypotension and dizziness, and symptomatic hypotension with first doses may not recur with repeated administration; the doses of other hypotensive agents can be reduced or staggered, and most patients remain excellent candidates for long-term ACE inhibition if appropriate measures minimize recurrence. Severe hyponatremia is identified as a risk factor, defined as serum sodium concentration less than 130 mmol per liter. Worsening renal function is described, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (greater than 0.3 mg per dL) observed in 15% to 30% of patients with severe HF and in only 5% to 15% of those with mild to moderate symptoms; renal function usually improves after reduction of concomitantly administered diuretics, and if diuretics cannot be reduced because of fluid retention, mild to moderate degrees of azotemia may need to be tolerated to maintain ACEI therapy. Hyperkalemia can occur and may be sufficiently severe to cause cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly when renal function deteriorates or with oral potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists, especially in diabetes mellitus.

### Lack of durable natriuresis and objective decongestion following SGLT2 inhibition in randomized controlled trials of patients with heart failure [^113oYJMf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with acutely decompensated or chronic heart failure experience dyspnea at rest or exertion, which is typically accompanied by increased cardiac filling pressures and circulating levels of natriuretic peptides as well as physical signs of fluid retention (i.e. edema, ascites, pulmonary rales or pleural effusion). Many of these clinical and physiological abnormalities are related to the retention of sodium and water by the kidneys, and accordingly, treatment with loop diuretics or aquaretics are accompanied by symptomatic improvement, a reduction in cardiac filling pressures and natriuretic peptides, and alleviation of physical signs of congestion. Increases in right and left ventricular filling pressures can be substantially reduced by loop diuretic therapy (typically by > 10 mm Hg) in patients with or without overt physical signs of fluid retention (i.e. jugular venous distension, ascites or peripheral edema).

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

High-output heart failure presents with similar symptoms and signs of systemic or pulmonary congestion, often with rapid heart rate and peripheral vasodilation; cardiac dysfunction may be represented by pathologically elevated cardiac output, echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dilation or dysfunction, and elevated natriuretic peptide concentrations; it is a response to extracardiac causes including liver disease, arteriovenous shunt, lung disease, thiamine deficiency, anemia, thyroid disease, or myeloproliferative disorders, with treatment generally directed to the underlying causes, and given its unique nature, it is appropriate that it have a separate classification.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^116bmNVF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

All included studies were reported as randomised, but not all reported on the methods of randomisation. Eight confirmed allocation concealment and were judged to be at low risk of bias, and the other 10 were classified as unclear. Blinding was often poorly done with only one study reporting blinding of both participants and study personnel to treatment allocation, and only five studies reported blinding outcome assessors. Fourteen studies reported outcomes on an intention‐to‐treat basis and attrition bias, eight studies were judged to be low risk as seven studies had no losses to follow‐up, and the one fully documented the reported losses.

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' (SoF) table. For overall quality of evidence, the primary outcome plus heart failure mortality, heart failure admission and all‐cause admission were judged to have low quality and quality of life was judged to be very low quality indicating low/very low confidence in the pooled result, but that the result could vary and is likely to be affected by future research. The quality of evidence for adverse events and cost, which were not pooled, were also judged to be low. Quality of evidence was downgraded predominantly for limitations in the study design and/or inconsistency in the data.

Potential biases in the review process

Whilst we did perform a thorough search with no date or language restrictions, it is possible some studies may have been overlooked in searching and study selection. We were unable to include data from one study for the primary outcome. Whilst only 15 studies contributed data for the funnel plot for all‐cause mortality, the graph does display a slight asymmetry with a lack of smaller studies showing a beneficial control effect. This suggests the potential for publication bias (see Figure 2).

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population

This multicenter, prospective registry study enrolled participants from 12 clinical sites in the United States and Australia. All adult patients aged ≥ 21 years admitted with a primary diagnosis of ADHF, regardless of LVEF, were screened. Informed consent was obtained from participants who met enrollment criteria and agreed to participate. Participants were categorized into one of three groups, ADHF alone, ADHF + WRF, and ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion at 96‐h post‐admission. Data collection varied by group, with the ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion group having the most extensive data collection. Due to the observational nature of this study, informed consent requirements were based on the local requirements of each participating institution and varied in level. For example, some sites require that all participants provide written informed consent before any screening took place, while others only required participants to provide written informed consent if they were assigned to the full data collection group (ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion). The institutional review boards at each of the 12 study sites approved the protocol and consent forms. Participants were enrolled from April 2019 to March 2020.

An increase in creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from baseline was used to define WRF, consistent with prior studies. The baseline creatinine and WRF were determined by site investigators from data obtained during the hospitalization or in the 90 days before hospital admission. The presence of persistent congestion at 96‐h post‐admission was defined by signs, symptoms, or objective findings of HF. If hemodynamic measurements were obtained, persistent congestion was defined as PCWP > 22 mmHg or CVP > 10 mmHg. In the absence of hemodynamic measurements, physical exam findings (e.g. lower extremity edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous pressure, or pulmonary rales), clinical symptoms (e.g. dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea), and confirmatory tests (e.g. chest x‐ray or echocardiography) were used.

### Are serial BNP measurements useful in heart failure management? Serial natriuretic peptide measurements are useful in heart failure management [^116uG8nr]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

To deny the fact that standard HF care has substantial opportunity for improvement is at the peril of even worse outcomes in our patients affected by the disorder. We have presented a strong rationale for the value of BNP- and NTproBNP–guided HF management. Experience gained in biomarker-guided HF trials suggests that the approach results in improvement in the quality of care without an excess of adverse events related to more aggressive management. This alone is difficult to ignore given the gaps in care that exist between RCTs and real-world practice. Beyond this fact, studies examining the strategy of biomarker-guided HF care have shown substantial improvement in outcome compared with well-managed control arms, benefits that are confirmed in meta-analysis and pooled data analyses, and justifies the imminent launch of the pivotal RCT that will lead to more widespread adoption of the approach. Compared with standard management, biomarker-guided care appears cost effective, may improve patient quality of life, and may promote reverse ventricular remodeling. Although certain subgroups such as the elderly may respond in a less vigorous manner to the approach, this may reflect the effects of age on HF therapy and how the strategy is deployed in elders rather than a weakness of the approach in older patients. A fair-minded assessment of the available data suggests that care supported by BNP/NT-proBNP–guided HF treatment — as an adjunct to standard clinical acumen — is superior to standard care. The limitation of standard care strategies is evident from the suboptimal uptake and application of proven therapies documented in HF registries. Far from being a crutch to support what we should already be doing (namely, optimally evaluating and managing our patients solely with clinical means), the inclusion of NP measurement within the HF management strategy augments the quality of monitoring and treatment. Denial of the benefits of NP monitoring potentially retards advances in the care of a high-risk population of patients that continues to grow in size and importance every day.

BNP/NT‑proBNP change and prognosis in heart failure: Reduction in B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N‑terminal pro‑B‑type natriuretic peptide (NT‑proBNP) levels represents a population with improved long‑term outcomes compared with those with persistently elevated levels despite appropriate treatment, and BNP and NT‑proBNP levels and their change could help guide discussions on prognosis as well as adherence to, and optimization of, guideline‑directed medical therapy (GDMT).

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided therapy for perioperative medicine? [^112Dwgm4]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

BNP-guided therapy in perioperative medicine

While preoperative revascularisation is costly and has not shown significant benefit in stable patients, BNP-guided therapy has not been prospectively tested in perioperative medicine but appears to be safeand cost-effective in stable heart failure patients. In inpatient and outpatient studies, patients with the largest relative reductions in BNP levels had the most favourable outcomes, whereas patients with the greatest percentage increase in BNP were observed to have the highest cardiac event rates. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials has shown that BNP-guided therapy reduced the relative risk of all cause mortality by 48% in heart failure patients under age 75. A randomised controlled trial on asymptomatic patients with risk factors but without heart failure also showed relative reduction of major cardiovascular events over 40% using BNP-guided therapy as prevention. It is encouraging that BNP-guided therapy led to relative reduction of major cardiovascular events over 40% both as prevention of heart failure in randomisedcontrolled trial (RCT) and as direct treatment of heart failure in meta-analysis. None of the meta-analysis or RCTs has detected any significant increase in adverse events from BNP-guided therapy in comparison with standard care. It is still controversial regarding the application of BNP-guided therapy in elderly above age 75. A recent RCT showed that BNP-guided therapy can be more effective in elderly over age 75 when the therapy was gradually titrated with small increment of dosing adjustment and close follow-up. A recent prospective study involving 1918 stable asymptomatic patients suggested that simple medication switch involving mostly one clinic visit can lead to BNP reduction associated with 13% potential relative reduction in mortality. This study also suggested that further up titration beyond one clinic visit is much less cost-effective in asymptomatic patients. Therefore, a cost-effective perioperative BNP-guided therapy in stable patients should aim to limit preoperative medication titration to no more than one extra clinic visits beyond the current standard of care. It has been proposed to start BNP-guided therapy for preoperative medical optimisation 4–5 weeks before surgery. Elevated BNP is common in patients with renal impairment due to poorly controlled hypervolemia, heart failure and/or other reasons. Medication adjustment such as titrating diuresis, nitrate and hydrazine may be ineffective for many of them. This is unlikely to be a major problem for using the algorithm which recommends the preoperative medication titration to be mostly limited to one round as long as BNP is not trending up significantly.

### Omaveloxolone (Skyclarys) [^11113Pfx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Elevation of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide

Treatment with SKYCLARYS can cause an increase in BNP, a marker of cardiac function. In Study 1, a total of 14% of patients treated with SKYCLARYS had an increase from baseline in BNP and a BNP above the ULN (100 pg/mL), compared to 4% of patients who received placebo. The incidence of elevation of BNP above 200 pg/mL was 4% in patients treated with SKYCLARYS. Cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure are common in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Patients were excluded from Study 1 if they had BNP levels > 200 pg/mL prior to study entry, or a history of clinically significant left-sided heart disease and/or clinically significant cardiac disease, with the exception of mild to moderate cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich's ataxia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Whether the elevations in BNP in Study 1 are related to SKYCLARYS or cardiac disease associated with Friedreich's ataxia is unclear.

Elevations in BNP may indicate cardiac failure and should prompt an evaluation of cardiac function. Check BNP prior to initiation of SKYCLARYS. Monitor patients for the signs and symptoms of fluid overload, such as sudden weight gain (3 pounds or more of weight gain in one day, or 5 pounds or more of weight gain in a week), peripheral edema, palpitations, and shortness of breath. If signs and symptoms of fluid overload develop, worsen, or require hospitalization, evaluate BNP and cardiac function, and manage appropriately. Management of fluid overload and heart failure may require discontinuation of SKYCLARYS.

### Nesiritide (BNP) in the management of postoperative cardiac patients [^116aZxHz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a promising new agent in the management of heart failure. The pharmacologic properties of BNP make it desirable to use in a subset of patients after cardiac surgical operations. Among these therapeutic potentials is the effect on markedly reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and central venous pressure with mild systemic vasodilatation. In addition, BNP directly effects the kidneys to promote natriuresis. We believe this agent to be useful in the treatment of the postcardiac surgery patients with left ventricular dysfunction and mild to moderate renal insufficiency. This report summarizes our experience in 2 patients.

### Screening for undiagnosed heart failure: a viewpoint [^112b9HUu]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of heart failure (HF) is characterized by a triad of (1) signs and symptoms, (2) cardiac alterations, and (3) natriuretic peptide elevation. Patients who exhibit alterations of cardiac structure or function without overt signs or symptoms of HF are staged as having "pre-HF". However, many people with undiagnosed HF walk little and do not exercise; thus, they may be classified as having asymptomatic "pre-HF" simply because they never exercise enough to feel breathless. Moreover, many patients have comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obesity and the physical limitations may be attributed to the comorbidities rather than to HF. Such comorbidities may also influence natriuretic peptide measurements. The potential implications of an HF misdiagnosis are that many patients may remain undertreated. This is illustrated with data from the HOMAGE (Heart Omics in AGEing) study, which included asymptomatic people with mild natriuretic peptide elevation. When comparing patient characteristics, HOMAGE participants were similar to those of ALDO-DHF (Effect of Spironolactone on Diastolic Function and Exercise Capacity in Patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) who were classified as symptomatic patients with HF. Given the confluence of HF with several cardiac-renal and metabolic conditions, we propose a simplified, pragmatic, and inclusive approach for early HF diagnosis and treatment.
