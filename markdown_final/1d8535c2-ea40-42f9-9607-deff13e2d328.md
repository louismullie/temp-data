## Question

Do corrhotic patients need to be on low salt diet

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with cirrhosis should be on a low-salt diet. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether ascites or volume overload is present. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for sodium restriction in compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. Next, I will examine the evidence on benefits and harms of strict versus moderate sodium restriction, including nutritional trade-offs and adherence. After that, I should define practical targets and counseling strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a clear, individualized recommendation with monitoring plans [^114jpGc3] [^112E82xt] [^114zSD7S].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the answer hinges on whether there is ascites or clinically significant volume overload. In compensated cirrhosis without ascites, routine sodium restriction is not supported and may be unnecessary; in decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or edema, guidelines consistently recommend dietary sodium restriction as part of first-line management alongside diuretics, so I need to ensure I anchor to that distinction before proceeding [^111Dhgxj] [^114jpGc3] [^117NYQZL].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline targets to avoid overgeneralization. AASLD recommends moderate sodium restriction to about 2 g/day (approximately 90 mmol/day) for patients with clinically evident ascites, and this threshold is echoed across multiple AASLD documents and practice updates, which I should treat as the default for grade 2 ascites and beyond [^113o4iib] [^112QsiRS] [^114jpGc3]. EASL guidance aligns with a moderate restriction of roughly 80–120 mmol/day (about 4.6–6.9 g salt/day) and explicitly advises against very low sodium diets (< 40 mmol/day), which helps frame the lower bound of restriction I should avoid [^112E82xt] [^114NcBaK] [^113s8tpd]. BASL/BSG similarly endorses a moderate restriction around 5–6.5 g/day (87–113 mmol/day) as a no-added-salt approach with avoidance of preprepared meals, reinforcing the practical translation of these targets [^114zSD7S] [^111nvHCi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stricter being better; I need to check the evidence on harms of overly strict sodium restriction. Multiple studies and guideline summaries note that severe sodium restriction below about 5 g/day can worsen caloric intake, increase sarcopenia risk, and may be associated with higher mortality, so I should be cautious not to over-restrict without a compensatory nutrition plan [^111Dhgxj] [^113HDZcP]. Observational cohorts report that salt-restricted groups had higher nutritional risk and higher six‑month mortality despite better ascites control, underscoring the need to balance fluid management with preservation of muscle mass and energy intake [^114pdNcB] [^115LFkuj]. Mechanistically, severe restriction can reduce palatability and total intake, worsening protein–energy malnutrition and catabolism, which is particularly dangerous in cirrhosis with baseline sarcopenia risk [^113HDZcP] [^111cARtX].

> I should double-check the adherence and feasibility data because poor adherence can convert a theoretically sound restriction into ineffective care. In outpatient cohorts, only about 30% of patients adhere to a 2 g/day sodium diet, and adherent patients often have 20% lower caloric intake, which can accelerate muscle loss; this reinforces the need for dietitian-led education and palatability strategies rather than rigid prescriptions that patients cannot sustain [^113HDZcP] [^114anBhj]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize education and referral; yes, AASLD, AGA, and BASL/BSG all call for structured dietary counseling and dietitian involvement to improve both adherence and nutritional adequacy [^114jpGc3] [^117NYQZL] [^114rCVgX].

> Now, I will translate targets into practical counseling so it is actionable. A no-added-salt diet with avoidance of precooked and highly processed foods typically achieves about 5–6 g/day of salt (approximately 87–113 mmol sodium), which matches BASL/BSG and sits within the EASL moderate range; I should confirm patients understand label reading and cooking from scratch to stay within this band without drifting into overly restrictive territory [^114zSD7S] [^111nvHCi]. Wait, let me verify the teaspoon framing; patient-facing summaries often equate the daily target to about one level teaspoon of salt total per day, which is a useful visual anchor for counseling and aligns with the 5 g ballpark figure [^116ies3z].

> But wait, what if the patient has sarcopenia, frailty, or cannot meet protein and calorie goals on a restricted diet? I need to ensure I individualize. AASLD explicitly recommends liberalizing sodium restriction to facilitate adequate oral intake in patients who screen positive for frailty or sarcopenia and cannot meet nutritional targets, and this should be paired with close monitoring and compensatory strategies to protect muscle mass [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP]. Let me reconsider the balance: in such cases, prioritizing protein and energy with a slightly higher sodium intake and intensifying diuretic monitoring may yield better net outcomes than rigid sodium restriction that worsens malnutrition [^114VcDug].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases so I do not overgeneralize. For hepatic hydrothorax, guidelines endorse sodium restriction plus diuretics as first-line, with thoracentesis as needed, so the same moderate restriction principles apply while tailoring to dyspnea and recurrence patterns [^114xXRjL] [^1145Kwy7]. For refractory ascites, continued dietary sodium restriction remains recommended to slow reaccumulation, but I need to ensure this is integrated with albumin for large-volume paracentesis and consideration of TIPS rather than escalating restriction beyond evidence-based targets [^116df35D] [^112bTgy8] [^1111AaRS]. For hyponatremia, I should confirm that fluid restriction is reserved for serum sodium ≤ 125–130 mmol/L, not used routinely for ascites management, and that sodium correction, if needed, is slow to avoid osmotic demyelination [^112kczed] [^112qX5xP].

> I will now examine monitoring and feedback loops to make this safe and dynamic. Daily weights, symptom tracking, and periodic assessment of renal function and electrolytes guide diuretic titration, and when available, 24‑hour urinary sodium or spot Na/K ratios can help distinguish dietary indiscretion from under‑diuresis; a spot Na/K ratio > 1 suggests adequate natriuresis, whereas ≤ 1 suggests the need to increase diuretics rather than further restrict sodium beyond moderate targets [^1163W3bL] [^115455tV]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach avoids reflexively tightening diet when the issue is pharmacologic under-treatment; yes, guidelines emphasize using urinary sodium to adjust therapy rather than defaulting to stricter restriction [^1163W3bL].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line so it is clinically usable. For patients with cirrhosis and ascites or volume overload, implement moderate sodium restriction around 2 g/day (about 90 mmol/day), recognizing that a practical translation is a no-added-salt diet with avoidance of processed foods that typically lands near 4.6–6.9 g/day of salt (80–120 mmol sodium), and pair this with diuretics, dietitian counseling, and close monitoring; avoid very low sodium diets (< 40 mmol/day) due to potential harm and poor adherence [^113o4iib] [^112E82xt] [^114zSD7S] [^113s8tpd]. For patients with cirrhosis without ascites, routine sodium restriction is not indicated and may be counterproductive if it suppresses appetite unnecessarily; instead, focus on high-protein, adequate-calorie intake with regular meals and a late-evening snack to mitigate catabolism [^111Dhgxj] [^113HDZcP] [^115EECBa]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with contemporary expert updates; AGA 2025 continues to endorse dietary sodium restriction with education and dietitian referral for ascites and volume overload, reinforcing the moderate, individualized strategy rather than strict restriction [^117NYQZL] [^1125frTY].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses nutrition explicitly to prevent unintended muscle loss. Protein targets of about 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day (up to 2.0 g/kg/day in severe sarcopenia or critical illness), frequent small meals with a late-evening snack, and early nutritional supplementation when intake is inadequate are core pillars; if sodium restriction impedes intake, liberalize sodium judiciously and intensify diuretic monitoring rather than sacrificing nutrition [^1121YhcS] [^1146gByK] [^113HDZcP]. Hold on, I should verify that this is consistent with AASLD malnutrition guidance; yes, the guidance supports liberalizing sodium as needed to meet intake goals and emphasizes structured nutrition support in cirrhosis [^114VcDug] [^115EECBa].

Patients with cirrhosis and **ascites or edema** should follow a **moderate sodium restriction** of about 2 g/day (88 mmol/day) [^113o4iib] to reduce fluid retention and improve diuretic response [^114jpGc3]. Strict sodium restriction is not recommended because it can worsen malnutrition and sarcopenia [^115LFkuj] [^113HDZcP] and is often poorly tolerated [^111Dhgxj]. For patients without ascites, routine sodium restriction is unnecessary; instead, emphasize a balanced, protein-rich diet with frequent small meals and a late-evening snack [^115ST4c2] [^111Dhgxj]. Individualize sodium targets for those with sarcopenia or frailty, and provide dietitian support to balance ascites control with nutrition [^114VcDug] [^117SRrWs].

---

## Rationale for sodium restriction in cirrhosis

Sodium retention drives ascites and edema in cirrhosis via **RAAS and sympathetic activation** [^114jpGc3]; moderate restriction reduces fluid overload and improves diuretic response [^114jpGc3].

---

## Evidence supporting sodium restriction

Multiple guidelines endorse **moderate sodium restriction** (about 2 g/day) for ascites or edema [^113o4iib] [^112E82xt]:

- **AASLD 2021**: Moderate sodium restriction (2 g/day) for grade 2 ascites [^113o4iib] [^112QsiRS].
- **EASL 2018**: Moderate restriction (80–120 mmol/day) for moderate, uncomplicated ascites [^112E82xt] [^114NcBaK].
- **BASL/BSG 2021**: Moderate restriction (≤ 5–6.5 g/day salt) for ascites [^114zSD7S] [^111nvHCi].

---

## Risks associated with strict sodium restriction

Excessive restriction can cause **significant harm**:

- **Malnutrition and sarcopenia**: Reduced intake and catabolism worsen nutrition and outcomes [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP].
- **Hyponatremia**: Increased risk, especially with diuretics [^111Dhgxj] [^1113TGnK].
- **Poor adherence**: Strict diets are hard to sustain, reducing effectiveness [^113HDZcP] [^114anBhj].

---

## Individualized approach to sodium restriction

Sodium targets should be **tailored to nutritional status, sarcopenia, and frailty** [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP]. For patients with sarcopenia or frailty, liberalize sodium to preserve intake and muscle mass [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP], and for those without ascites, routine restriction is unnecessary; prioritize adequate protein and calories [^115ST4c2] [^111Dhgxj].

---

## Practical dietary recommendations

- **Moderate restriction**: Aim for ~2 g/day sodium in ascites/edema [^113o4iib] [^112E82xt].
- **No added salt**: Avoid table salt and high-sodium processed foods [^114zSD7S] [^111nvHCi].
- **Balanced nutrition**: Ensure 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein and 35 kcal/kg/day [^113HDZcP] [^115ST4c2].
- **Frequent meals**: Small, frequent meals with a late-evening snack to limit catabolism [^115EECBa] [^115ST4c2].
- **Dietitian support**: Structured counseling improves adherence and nutrition [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly reassess sodium intake, adherence, and nutrition; adjust restriction to balance ascites control with nutrition and quality of life [^113HDZcP] [^1163W3bL].

---

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites benefit from **moderate sodium restriction** (~2 g/day) [^113o4iib], which improves fluid control without compromising nutrition; strict restriction should be avoided, and intake should be individualized — especially in those with sarcopenia or frailty — with dietitian support to optimize outcomes [^114VcDug] [^117SRrWs].

Dietary salt restriction

There is little evidence to support salt restriction in patients with cirrhosis in absence of ascites. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, seven RCTs and one cross-sectional survey have examined the role of salt restriction (online supplemental table 2). One of the studies has only been published as an abstract. Four of the earlier RCTsfound no difference in ascites control in those with and without salt restriction. Two recent RCTs found that a salt unrestricted diet (5–6.5 g/day) in contrast to a salt restricted diet (< 5 g/day), resulted in ascites disappearance in a larger proportion (45% vs 16%) over a shorter time period and also significantly reduced the need for large volume paracentesis (LVP). Additionally, five of the eight above-mentioned studies reported significant adverse events with salt restriction, including hyponatraemia, reduced caloric intake, higher risk of renal impairment (0% vs 14%), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), SBPand mortality. In a study by Sorrentino et al,1-year mortality was 45–60% (salt unrestricted diet) versus 82.5% (salt restricted diet).

Thus salt restricted diets (< 5 g m of salt, < 85 mmol sodium/day) in patients with cirrhosis and ascites do not improve ascites control and, on the contrary, can result in complications. Additionally, such diets are difficult to comply with, especially since the average European ingests about 10 g of salt/day. A cross-sectional surveyindicated that only about a third of cirrhotic patients were compliant with salt restriction, with an additional 45% incorrectly stating that they were. Based on these data, patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet, with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87 mmol–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. An ongoing systematic review is assessing the role of salt restriction in patients with ascites due to cirrhosis.

Conclusion

Our findings challenge the long-standing clinical dogma that strict salt restriction is universally beneficial for cirrhotic patients with ascites. The results indicate that severe sodium restriction despite being beneficial to ascites control- may worsen nutritional status, increase sarcopenia prevalence, and lead to higher mortality rates. These findings emphasize the need for a more individualized approach to dietary sodium management, balancing ascites control with the preservation of nutritional and functional status.

However, there are limitations to consider. Being a single-center study, the generalizability of the findings to broader populations may be limited. Furthermore, while baseline sarcopenia was assessed, the absence of serial sarcopenia measurements precludes the evaluation of its progression over time. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period, though adequate for short-term mortality and nutritional impact evaluation, does not account for long-term outcomes related to sodium intake, necessitating further longitudinal studies.

Our study underscores the need for an individualized, patient-centered approach to dietary sodium management in cirrhotic patients. Rather than a blanket recommendation for strict sodium restriction, a tailored approach that considers each patient's nutritional status, sarcopenia risk, and fluid balance is warranted. Future multicenter, randomized controlled trials are necessary to refine sodium intake recommendations and develop evidence-based dietary guidelines that optimize both ascites control and nutritional status.

Few studies, with varying methodological quality and inconsistent findings, have examined the effects of salt restriction on nutrition in patients with cirrhosis. Soulsby et al. found that patients without salt restrictions experienced reduced ascites, better nutritional status, and shorter hospital stays. Similarly, Gu et al. in the largest study to date, randomized 200 patients with ascites into unrestricted (8.8 g NaCl) and restricted (4.2 g NaCl) sodium groups, finding that the unrestricted group experienced better renal function, higher calorie intake, increased serum albumin, and shorter hospital stays, along with greater ascites resolution (P = 0.001). Similarly, Sorrentino et al. observed that the sodium-restricted group required paracentesis more frequently and had higher mortality rates. Morando et al. in a study of 120 outpatients, noted that in the salt-restricted diet group (4.6 g NaCl/day) there was reduced caloric intake by 20%, with only 30.8% adhering to the diet. Many patients misunderstand their sodium intake levels, likely due to inadequate dietary guidance, leading some to unintentionally lower their calorie intake to reduce salt intake.

The present study highlights the critical role of sarcopenia in cirrhotic patient outcomes. Sarcopenia was significantly more prevalent in the SRD group (p < 0.006), with a lower skeletal muscle index (SMI) and trunk protein muscle mass (TR PMM). More importantly, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 2.684, p = 0.02) in our multivariate analysis. These findings corroborate previous reports by Montano-Loza et al. and Kalafateli et al. who identified sarcopenia as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients.

The lower PMM in the SRD group may stem from dietary restrictions and cirrhosis-related catabolism, whereas fluid overload in the SUD group may artificially inflate PMM readings because increased extracellular fluid can distort body composition. It is likely that the results of a small study by Soulsby et al. who reported reduced dry body weight and mid-arm muscle circumference over four weeks on a low-sodium diet, although this timeframe is too brief to assess long-term impacts. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association likely involve increased catabolism due to inadequate protein intake, loss of muscle mass secondary to sodium restriction-induced metabolic alterations, and impaired nitrogen balance.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^113WU9cz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary rationale for sodium restriction in cirrhosis is to reduce fluid retention and decrease the need for paracentesis. This study data suggests that sodium restriction was necessarily translated into superior ascites control.

Remarkedly, the SUD group showed significantly higher modified weight than in the SRD group (p = 0.001). Total body water (TBW) was also significantly higher in the SUD group (mean 40.31 ± 12.08) than in the SRD group (mean 33.84 ± 6.86, p < 0.001), which could indicate that patients on an unrestricted diet retained more fluid, leading to higher TBW. Water retention increases body weight without necessarily reflecting improved nutritional or muscle status, as it primarily represents extracellular fluid accumulation.

Hence, these results demonstrate that salt restriction significantly improves ascites control, and the regression analysis confirmed that SRD was an independent predictor of improved ascites control (OR = 2.461, p < 0.001). These findings align with previous studies supporting sodium restriction as a fundamental component of ascites management. However, our study suggests that while ascites control is enhanced, it comes at the cost of worsening nutritional status, warranting careful dietary adjustments.

The priority is therefore to meet protein requirements (minimum of 1.5 g/kg dry weight) to prevent catabolism. Attenuation of muscle breakdown improves function and well-being, which in turn supports volitional oral intake. Protein intake should increase to 2 g/kg in the presence of severe sarcopenia and/or ascites. Nutritional supplements to support protein intake may be required even when overall energy intake is maintained.

Nutritional supplements providing protein and energy are recommended where energy intake is low (< 30–35 Kcal/kg dry weight per day). Fasting times should be minimised to 2–3 hours, so patients should aim to have three meals and three snacks per day. Adding a carbohydrate (such as cereal/toast/milk and biscuits/cereal bar/flapjack for non-diabetic/lower BMI patients) or mixed carbohydrate/protein (such as yoghurt/cheese and crackers/peanut butter on toast for diabetic patients/those with higher BMI) bedtime snack and including carbohydrate at each meal supports fuelling and preservation of muscle protein. Where jaundice is present, a combination of lower fat diets and supplements is recommended to minimise biliary malabsorption. Patients with ascites or oedema should follow a no added salt diet, being careful to preserve protein and overall nutritional intake. Consider short-term enteral nutrition where oral nutritional support is insufficient or not consistently achieved, particularly in patients suitable for transplantation, or those with encephalopathy who are unable to eat. Nasogastric feeding is first line but nasojejunal feeding is well tolerated if nasogastric feeding is limited by early satiety.

AASLD 2021 practice guidance — calorie targets and sodium restriction in cirrhosis: Calorie targets should be personalized to the patient. When possible, indirect calorimetry should be used to provide a personalized intake prescription. In the absence of indirect calorimetry, acceptable approaches include traditional predictive equations (e.g. Harris-Benedict) and weight-based equations using ideal body weight, with nonobese targets of at least 35 kcal/kg body weight/day and obese (nonhospitalized, clinically stable) BMI-stratified targets of 25–35 kcal/kg/day for BMI 30–40 kg/m² and 20–25 kcal/kg/day for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m². The guidance also supports using BMI-adjusted, weight-based energy intake calculations when indirect calorimetry is not available. Sodium restriction can impair intake and adherence; in a study of 120 outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites, only 31% were adherent to a 2 g-sodium diet and adherent patients had a 20% lower daily caloric intake. When sodium restriction impedes meeting nutritional targets, liberalization of sodium restriction should be considered and should be paired with educational resources to improve palatability; in patients with screen positive for frailty or sarcopenia who cannot meet targets on a sodium-restricted diet, liberalization of sodium restriction should be considered to facilitate adequate oral intake.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^112auaBn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis, a chronic liver condition characterized by irreversible fibrosis, poses significant challenges in clinical management, particularly in advanced stages when complications such as ascites develop. Approximately 50% of cirrhotic patients develop ascites within ten years of diagnosis, making management a central component of care for this population. Sodium retention plays a pivotal role; therefore, dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended as a first-line intervention to manage ascites. Cirrhotic patients with ascites are advised to limit their salt intake, with recommendations ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 g daily, with most guidelines recommending around 5 g (equal to a teaspoon of table salt).

However, despite its long-standing use, the role of strict salt restriction in ascites management remains a subject of debate. While sodium restriction aims to control fluid retention, emerging evidence suggests that excessive restriction may negatively impact nutritional status, muscle mass, and overall prognosis. Cirrhotic patients are already at high risk of protein-energy malnutrition and sarcopenia due to factors such as anorexia, hypermetabolism, and impaired nutrient absorption. Severe sodium restriction may exacerbate these issues, leading to increased catabolism, muscle wasting, and worse clinical outcomes.

Despite the widespread adoption of sodium restriction, there is a lack of longitudinal studies systematically evaluating both its benefits and potential risks, particularly regarding its impact on sarcopenia, nutritional status, and mortality. Previous studies have primarily focused on short-term ascites control, overlooking the long-term consequences of dietary sodium restriction on body composition, functional status, and survival. Furthermore, the relationship between sodium intake, paracentesis frequency, and nutritional deterioration remains poorly understood.

Given this knowledge gap, our study aims to assess the impact of salt restriction on sarcopenia, nutritional status, and mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites. By evaluating these parameters over a six-month follow-up period, we seek to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits of sodium restriction and challenge the long-held assumption that strict sodium limitation is universally beneficial in this patient population. Accordingly, this study was designed to evaluate the impact of salt restriction on nutritional status, muscle mass, mortality added to ascites control in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Cirrhosis with ascites — dietary sodium and fluid restriction guidance: In patients with cirrhosis and ascites on diuretics, the guideline states it "cannot recommend for or against strict sodium restricted diets (Insufficient evidence, no recommendation)". The page notes that the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases "recommends moderate dietary sodium restriction to 2,000 mg/d (88 mEq of sodium per day) for clinically evident ascites in patients with cirrhosis". For fluid restriction, it reports "there are no high-quality randomized studies" and that "Fluid restriction is not required in the management of ascites"; however, "when the serum sodium falls below 125 mEq/L due to dilutional or isotonic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended by most organizations including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases".

Discussion

This prospective observational cohort study provides critical insights into the complex interplay between salt restriction, nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality in cirrhotic patients with grade III ascites. Our findings challenge the conventional paradigm that strict dietary sodium restriction is universally beneficial for ascites management. Instead, our results suggest that while sodium restriction may theoretically reduce fluid retention, it is associated with significant adverse effects, including higher mortality rates, increased prevalence of sarcopenia, and poorer nutritional status. These findings align with emerging literature questioning the indiscriminate application of sodium restriction in cirrhotic patients and highlight the need for a more nuanced, individualized approach to dietary management.

Malnutrition is a well-recognized complication in patients with cirrhosis, with prevalence rates reaching up to 80%. Protein-energy malnutrition, compounded by increased metabolic demands and anorexia, is exacerbated by excessive sodium restriction, as demonstrated in our study. One of the most striking findings was the significant increase in nutritional risk among patients on a salt-restricted diet. Patients in the SRD group had a higher proportion of high nutritional risk (58.1%) than those in the SUD group (41.9%) (p = 0.001). The logistic regression analysis revealed that SRD was an independent predictor of high nutritional risk (OR = 0.129, p = 0.004). This suggests that excessive sodium restriction may contribute to insufficient caloric and protein intake, leading to muscle wasting. Similar findings were reported by Sorrentino et al. emphasizing that restricting sodium without compensatory nutritional strategies may lead to deterioration in muscle and protein stores.

Monitoring response to therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis

Treatment of decompensation events is essential to cirrhosis management. Equally important is monitoring responses to treatment, which enables clinicians to adjust treatment duration and strategy, as well as evaluate treatment success. Furthermore, there is an unmet need to develop and validate predictive biomarkers that can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from treatments and those who are most likely to experience adverse events.

Monitoring response to diuretics in the treatment of ascites and edema

Ascites and edema develop with cirrhosis because of a marked alteration in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume. Sodium and associated water retention cause accumulation of extracellular fluid, which results in ascites and leg edema, leading to discomfort, impaired walking, and decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy with aldosterone antagonists, alone or combined with loop diuretics, can increase sodium excretion. The goal of this treatment is to achieve a negative sodium balance, which results in a negative fluid balance because water is eliminated with sodium. A low-sodium diet should also be implemented.

The ideal test for monitoring the efficacy of the treatment of ascites and edema would be an NIT to quantify fluid in extracellular spaces. Diuretics would be administered until fluid volume in the extracellular spaces had returned to normal. Unfortunately, such a tool does not exist. Instead, patients are monitored with less sophisticated tools that estimate the effect of treatment on total fluid (eg, by monitoring body weight). Alternatively, the biological effect of diuretics can be monitored easily by measuring changes in urinary sodium excretion (in mEq/day, measured accurately by 24 h urine collection). An effective treatment of ascites is associated with a reduction in body weight of no more than 0.5–1 kg per day (1 kg if peripheral edema is also present). Effective diuretic treatment should increase sodium excretion compared to baseline, with 24 h sodium excretion exceeding the presumed sodium intake (90–100 mEq/day with a low-sodium diet). The major risks associated with such treatment include diuretic-induced AKI and hypovolemia (Table 3).

### International survey among hepatologists and pulmonologists on the hepatic hydrothorax: plea for recommendations [^115uDafE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Low salt diet — diuretics

Regarding the treatment of the hydrothorax, most of the responders answered that the treatment of hepatic hydrothorax relies primarily on the combination of a low salt diet and diuretics. It should be noted, however, that our questionnaire did not specify whether a combined use of furosemide and spironolactone associated with a low-sodium diet was preferable to the use of only one diuretic whereas most studies recommend the co-administration of furosemide 40 mg and spironolactone 100 mg per day to obtain a greater mobilisation of the hydrothorax, with a stepwise increase in this combination of diuretics.

20 to 30% of the patients may have a persistent or recurrent hydrothorax despite the gradual and well-conducted use of diuretics and a low salt diet, however there was no clear definition of what a refractory hydrothorax is for 45% of the responders.

Furthermore, the use of diuretics can lead to hydro-electrolytic disorders, renal failures, hemodynamic instability for fragile patients.

The number of repeated pleural punctures that should lead to the discussion of other treatments was in median 4 without significant difference between the answers originated by the PN and the HG. This number is high due to the risk of developing a pneumothorax and hemothorax as stated above.

Most responders recommended a collegial discussion among the HG, PN, liver and thoracic surgeons for patients with difficult -to -treat HH.

Pleural drain

Although several publications have shown that a pleural drain placement for a hydrothorax was associated with a high rate of complications; it has been observed that it was performed by 38% responders in this study.

In a recent study, it was reported that the in-hospital mortality after a pleural drain placement for a hydrothorax occurred for 40% of cirrhotic patients with a cirrhosis classified as Child Pugh (CP) C and 16% of stage B patients.

Moreover, in a very important recent study carried out on more than 140,000 cirrhotic patients, among whom 1,981 presented a HH requiring repeated pleural punctures, 905 patients had a pleural drain placed inside them and for these patients the length of hospitalisation and the mortality rate were twice as high as for patients with a simple thoracic resection.

Thus, for all these reasons, the AASLD recommendations state that a pleural drain placement is contraindicated for patients with a hepatic hydrothorax.

Group allocation

Patients were divided into two groups based on their dietary adherence: the salt-restricted diet (SRD) group and the salt-unrestricted diet (SUD) group. Allocation was performed according to the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DRSQ) questionnaire in two groups. The urinary spot test along with weight loss assessment led to the exclusion of 13 cases with urinary Na/K and insignificant weight loss following both diuresis and abdominal paracentesis (Fig. 1). The remaining 102 patients were grouped as follows: 46 with SRD and 56 with SUD.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of included cases

Sarcopenia, and nutritional status were evaluated once at baseline to compare its prevalence between the two groups. Patients were then followed for six months to assess how salt restriction influenced mortality.

All patients were subjected to the collection of all baseline recruitment data: demographic data (age, sex, distribution, occupation, smoking, and alcohol intake), etiology of liver disease, time since the diagnosis of cirrhosis, time since the appearance of ascites, type of ascites (responsive or refractory) according to the criteria of the International Club of Ascites, and frequency of paracentesis. Laboratory investigations include prothrombin activity, index normalized ratio (INR), serum total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, urea, and the serum concentration of sodium and potassium and a random "spot" urine sodium concentration and (K) concentration.

Questionnaire

All patients included in this study were interviewed by the same operator. The DSRQ, which were translated into the Arabic language. The DSRQ is an assessment instrument used to measure patients' perceptions of their barriers to and attitudes toward following a low-sodium diet. The original instrument is divided into three subscales: 1) attitude; 2) subjective norms; and 3) perceived behavioural control. The attitude subscale comprises six items and assesses patients' beliefs about the results of adopting a given behaviour. The subjective norm subscale consists of three items and refers to the importance of the patient's perception that others approve or disapprove of performing the behaviour. Finally, the perceived behavioural control subscale comprises seven items and evaluates the patient's ability to identify facilitators and barriers related to behaviour.

The spot urine Na/K ratio was evaluated for the objective assessment of actual diuresis.

Nutritional assessment

Patients also underwent nutritional assessment using the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT).

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^115LFkuj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Salt restriction is a cornerstone in managing ascites in cirrhotic patients; however, its impact on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality remains unclear.

Aim

To evaluate the effects of a salt-restricted diet (SRD) on ascites control, body composition, sarcopenia development, and patient survival in cirrhotic patients with decompensated liver disease.

Methods

This prospective study included 102 patients with grade III ascites, categorized into two groups based on dietary adherence: Salt-Restricted Diet (SRD), (n = 46) and Salt-Unrestricted Diet (SUD) (n = 56). Sodium intake was assessed using the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ) and spot urine Na/K ratio. Nutritional status, sarcopenia, ascites control, and six-month mortality were evaluated.

Results

The SRD group showed better ascites control, with fewer paracentesis sessions per month (1.57 ± 0.65 vs. 4.07 ± 1.43, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in the SRD group (p < 0.001), with lower SMI (4.88 ± 7.13 vs. 16.7 ± 544.8, p < 0.001) and TR PMM (19.03 ± 3.68 vs. 71.92 ± 191.9, p < 0.001). Higher nutritional risk was significantly associated with SRD (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly higher in the SRD group (67.4%) compared to the SUD group (35.7%), p = 0.001. Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia (OR = 2.684, p = 0.006) and SRD (OR = 1.65, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

While effective in ascites control, sodium restriction may compromise nutritional status, heighten sarcopenia risk, and increase mortality, highlighting the need for a more individualized dietary approach.

### Consensus care recommendations for alfapumpin cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites [^113n1LU3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Long term care

This section covers patient and caregiver training and support, long-term prophylaxis, monitoring, nutrition and long-term complications.

Patients' health care is often managed by general practitioners (GPs). Alfapump ® -specific treatment should not be changed without consulting the hepatologist. The GP and other health care providers, especially those whose assessments and/or treatments could potentially influence pump function, should be made aware of limitations (such as, importantly, device damage by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and long-term complications) to facilitate early identification and appropriate referral.

Patients and their primary caregiver should be familiarised with pump use, especially charging, diet guidance and use of over-the-counter analgetics. Importantly, they should be familiar with early signs of complications and should be encouraged to contact the hepatologist or implant centre upon detection of any warning signs. Educational material should be provided by the centre and the patient should be walked through the important points before discharge.

Dietary restrictions may be relaxed in order to improve quality of life, general nutrition and sarcopenia. Guidelines may be a useful starting point, however, adherence to a strict low sodium diet might be difficult. A protein-rich "no added salt" diet is proposed. In case of TDV increase to volumes larger than 1 L following dietary changes, a sodium-restricted diet needs to be re-introduced.

Fluid intake should not exceed 2 L per day. Hyponatremia should be managed as in any other cirrhotic patient (fluid intake restriction) and the pump settings left unaltered. Excessive fluid intake might result in ascites volumes that are uncontrollable by the pump.

Similar to post-implantation care, albumin should be substituted according to current guidelines and local standards of the treating expert centre.

An overview of symptoms and management of common complications that may appear in the long term is provided in Table 2. Although the risk of developing MDR infections related to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis remains a matter of concern, patients receiving alfapump ® are at a very high risk of infection, and consequently antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued until explant.

Barriers to knowledge and adherence

Of the 43 patients who reported taking medications, only 24 patients (56.0%) recalled being told how to take them. Eighty-five percent of decompensated patients reported being told to maintain a low salt diet compared to 40% of compensated cirrhotics (p < 0.01), which is consistent with disease management of ascites. Decompensated patients were also more likely to be taking diuretics (p < 0.01), but less than one-third knew to keep a record of weight and blood pressure which can both be variably affected by disease and pharmacotherapy.

Fourteen patients (33.0%) stated that they could not afford their medications, though this was not found to be related to employment status, polypharmacy or disease severity (p > 0.05). Of the 40 patients who completed the adherence tool, only 7 were categorised as having 'high' adherence.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^111PzU43]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the most striking findings of our study is the significantly higher mortality rate in the SRD group (67.4%) compared to the SUD group (35.7%, p = 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for confounders, with logistic regression confirming salt restriction as an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 1.63–8.48, p = 0.002). This raises important concerns regarding the conventional wisdom advocating for stringent sodium restriction in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the impact of sodium intake on mortality. Pashayee-Khamene et al. found that moderate sodium restriction, rather than severe limitation, was associated with improved survival in cirrhotic patients. In contrast, Sorrentino et al. demonstrated that patients on a strict salt-restricted diet without nutritional support had a 3.9-fold higher risk of mortality within one year. Our findings align with these studies, reinforcing the notion that excessive sodium restriction may have unintended deleterious effects on patient survival.

A balanced dietary approach is essential for cirrhotic patients to mitigate the nutritional risks of salt restriction, including muscle loss and malnutrition. Adequate protein intake (1.2–1.5 g/kg/day), high-quality protein sources, and BCAA supplementation help preserve muscle mass, while frequent meals and bedtime snacks counteract catabolism. Moderate sodium restriction (5–7 g salt/day) optimizes ascites control without causing excessive volume contraction or hyponatremia. Additionally, potassium-rich foods and calcium/vitamin D supplementation support electrolyte balance and bone health. Future research should explore structured nutritional interventions to enhance both ascites management and overall nutritional outcomes.

This study has several strengths, including its prospective design, which allows for a more accurate assessment of dietary sodium adherence and its effects on clinical outcomes compared to retrospective analyses. The comprehensive evaluation of multiple clinically relevant endpoints, such as sarcopenia, nutritional status, and mortality, provides a holistic understanding of sodium restriction's impact on cirrhotic patients. Additionally, the use of validated methodologies, including the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT) for nutritional assessment and bioelectrical impedance analysis for sarcopenia evaluation, strengthens the study's reliability. The sample size was adequate for detecting significant differences in mortality and sarcopenia, as confirmed by post hoc power analysis, ensuring robustness in the findings.

Contradictory, was the observation reported by Ruiz-Margáin et al. who noted that a less restrictive sodium approach did not worsen ascites control but improved nutritional outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

While paracentesis frequency is a widely used marker for ascites control, it does not fully capture the complex interplay of fluid balance, nutritional status, and renal function in cirrhotic patients. To address this limitation, our study also considered changes in body weight, TBW measured by BIA, and serum sodium levels as additional markers of ascites management. Our results indicate that patients in the SRD group exhibited lower TBW and required fewer paracenteses, suggesting better ascites control. However, the significant weight loss observed in the SRD group raises concerns about nutritional depletion and potential muscle loss due to excessive sodium restriction. These findings mirror similar results in literature. For instance, Gu et al. and Sorrentino et al. reported that patients following a less restrictive sodium regimen had better nutritional outcomes, including higher caloric and protein intake, which contributed to improved ascites control and reduced need for paracentesis. Bernardi et al. also highlighted that excessive sodium restriction can exacerbate malnutrition and muscle wasting, ultimately leading to more frequent ascites' recurrence. These findings highlight the delicate balance between sodium restriction, fluid management, and nutritional status in cirrhotic patients. Future studies should integrate longitudinal assessments of ascitic fluid volume, renal function, and body composition to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of ascites control in response to dietary interventions.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^1114R5iZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 key concepts — outcomes and interventions in liver disease emphasize that presence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is associated with higher risk of mortality (in-hospital, waitlist, and posttransplant), length of stay, complications, and infections compared with patients without malnutrition. Given that sarcopenia is associated with worse patient outcomes before, during, and after liver transplantation, structured programs are needed to assess and treat sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease, especially patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, should have dietary assessment to ensure adequate nutritional intake. Evidence for supplemental vitamin D in chronic liver disease is limited; however, if vitamin D level is low, supplementation may offer bone-related and liver-related health benefits. Zinc supplementation should be considered for patients with liver disease and hypozincemia and/or signs/symptoms of zinc deficiency. Lifestyle modification with diet and exercise decreases adverse clinical outcomes in patients with MASH and should be encouraged independent of MASH pharmacotherapy. In patients with cirrhosis and evidence of fluid retention (ascites and/or edema), free water restriction may be needed when serum sodium is below 126 mEq/L.

Patients should be advised to eat a varied diet with three meals a day and be encouraged to include protein with each meal (aiming for 1.2–1.5 g/kg body weight/day). A protein and carbohydrate supper or evening snack minimises the overnight fast, reducing protein breakdown and muscle catabolism. Where oral intake is good, they should be encouraged to maintain or improve the quality of their diet with as many fruits and vegetables as they can manage.

Obesity is at least as frequent in cirrhosis as in the general population (20–35%) and affects most individuals with MASLD-related cirrhosis. Sarcopenia can be missed in the presence of obesity, and both obesity and sarcopenia can worsen the prognosis in cirrhosis. Implementing nutritional and lifestyle changes (including moderate exercise) to achieve progressive weight loss (> 5–10%) in obese patients with cirrhosis, and adopting a tailored, moderately hypocaloric (500–800 kcal/day deficit) diet, including adequate protein intake (> 1.5 g proteins/kg ideal body weight/day) can be used to achieve weight loss without compromising muscle mass. However, a slower sustained weight loss with calorie restriction of 250–500 kcal deficit is generally preferred to preserve muscle mass, particularly where exercise levels are low. Physical activity is often overlooked but is an important aspect of care in all patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of aetiology, and especially those with sarcopenic obesity. Patients should be encouraged to follow WHO advice of at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous-intensity exercise per week with muscle strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week. However, any physical activity is better than none, and exercise can be built up slowly and gradually over time. Weight loss should be under dietetic supervision with regular checks on muscle mass and function.

### The mechanism of improved sodium homeostasis of low-dose losartan in preascitic cirrhosis [^111qq969]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Renal sodium retention on standing is one aspect of the abnormal renal sodium handling in preascitic, well-compensated patients with cirrhosis. Recently, it has been shown that low doses (7.5 mg) of the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist, losartan, can reverse renal sodium retention on high, 200-mmol sodium/d diet in these patients and restore them to sodium balance. Therefore, the effect of 7.5 mg of losartan on sodium excretion, when changing from supine to erect posture for 2 hours, was examined in 10 well-compensated patients with cirrhosis and 9 age- and sex-matched controls on the same sodium diet, under strictly controlled metabolic conditions. In contrast to control subjects, in whom sodium excretion was unaffected, single 7.5-mg doses of losartan again restored the preascitic patients with cirrhosis to sodium balance. In addition, it blunted the fall in erect posture- induced renal sodium excretion by a reduction in proximal and distal tubular reabsorption of sodium. These changes occurred without any significant changes in blood volumes, systemic and renal hemodynamics, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtered sodium load compared with controls, and despite activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which was still within normal levels. In conclusion, the beneficial natriuretic effects of low-dose losartan on erect posture - induced sodium retention in preascitic cirrhosis supports the suggestion that the pathophysiology of sodium retention in preascites is in part caused by an intrarenal tubular effect of Ang II in that posture.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

Regarding medical management for hepatic hydrothorax, more specifically with respect to diuretic therapy, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to implement dietary sodium restriction and initiate diuretics at the lowest effective dose for the management of patients with cirrhosis with hepatic hydrothorax. Guide dose escalation based on symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Provide education and refer to a dietitian for dietary management. Identify and address triggers of liver decompensation.

Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy — Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss, and fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present; a formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) are the mainstay of diuretic treatment of cirrhotic ascites, and the recommended initial dose of spironolactone is 100 mg/day. Two studies addressing the best way to use these diuretics showed that for the first episode of ascites, treatment with aldosterone antagonists alone generated an adequate response with fewer side effects, whereas those with long-standing ascites responded better to a combined diuretic treatment.

### Dietary interventions in liver cirrhosis [^114cPCMg]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is associated with significant nutritional risks that often result in serious hepatic complications and poor survival rates. Diet is an important but underutilized aspect in the treatment modality of cirrhosis. Therefore, the aims of this review are to ascertain nutritional risks associated with its pathophysiology and to summarize existing evidence that support dietary recommendations for managing this patient population. Alterations in substrate utilization for energy production is a main feature of liver cirrhosis, resulting in increased catabolism of protein stores and a predisposition toward protein-energy malnutrition, even in the early stages of the disease. The body of evidence suggests that a high energy and protein (> 1.2g/kg body weight/d) diet consumed frequently and late in the evening is effective in improving nutritional status of these patients and has been associated with improved hospitalization and mortality rates. The use of branched-chain amino acid supplementation shows promise in reducing cirrhosis-related complications but are currently limited by adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. Furthermore exploration of dietary manipulation of branched-chain amino acid warrants further examination. Evidence is also accumulating that protein intake should not be restricted in patients with hepatic encephalopathy with earlier studies of protein restriction neglecting to account for the relative increase in fermentable fiber which would reduce the absorption of ammonia into the portal system in a way similar to supplementation with lactulose. Finally, a major finding of this review is the need to improve the quality and quantity of dietary intervention studies for patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly with the use of partial or whole dietary sources. In conclusion, dietary management of cirrhosis is not a one-size fits all approach but should be implemented earlier on in the treatment algorithm to improve the clinical prognosis of cirrhosis.

Patient summary

These guidelines have been produced on behalf of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) in collaboration with the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL). These guidelines are aimed at healthcare professionals who look after patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Ascites is the build-up of fluid in the belly (abdomen). This occurs when the liver gets irreversibly scarred, a condition known as cirrhosis. Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis.

All patients with a new onset of ascites should have the fluid tested. This involves inserting a small needle into the abdomen and removing about two tablespoons of ascitic fluid. The fluid is then analysed for protein and white cell count. Protein count can help differentiate whether the cause of ascites is cirrhosis or whether the ascites is due to other causes like heart disease or cancer. The white cell count indicates whether there is an infection in the ascitic fluid. If infection is present, this is treated with a short course of antibiotics. Infection of ascites should be ruled out at every hospital admission as it carries a high risk of death and should therefore be diagnosed and treated promptly. After this initial treatment, patients are given long-term antibiotics to prevent repeat infections.

No salt should be added at the table to food. The total amount of salt in food per day should not be more than the equivalent of one teaspoon. Patients should read labels on prepared foods to confirm their daily salt intake is within the limit of 5 g of salt. The initial treatment for patients with ascites involves taking medication, commonly known as 'water tablets' (diuretics). These drugs are begun at a small dose, which is gradually increased until the ascites is treated. Diuretics can have side effects such dehydration, confusion, abnormal levels of sodium and potassium and kidney damage. Therefore patients should be monitored while taking these tablets.

As the liver disease progresses the ascites may no longer respond to medication. This is known as untreatable or refractory ascites. This requires the patient to come into hospital every few weeks to have a temporary drain inserted into the abdomen and the ascitic fluid drained. If more than 5 L of fluid is removed, patients are also given a protein solution into the vein to prevent dehydration.

Refractory ascites — dietary sodium and fluid restriction: Dietary sodium restriction is important at all stages of ascites and may reduce ascites in patients who excrete approximately 80 mmol of sodium in urine per day, while fluid restriction in cirrhosis with refractory ascites is often impractical because daily urine output is usually less than 1 L; fluid restriction is recommended when serum sodium is ≤ 125 mmol/L or when its onset is rapid.

### The nutritional management of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: international society for hepatic encephalopathy and nitrogen metabolism consensus [^1115sZuK]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Nitrogen metabolism plays a major role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with cirrhosis. Modulation of this relationship is key to the management of HE, but is not the only nutritional issue that needs to be addressed. The assessment of nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis is problematic. In addition, there are significant sex-related differences in body composition and in the characteristics of tissue loss, which limit the usefulness of techniques based on measures of muscle mass and function in women. Techniques that combine subjective and objective variables provide reasonably accurate information and are recommended. Energy and nitrogen requirements in patients with HE are unlikely to differ substantially from those recommended in patients with cirrhosis per se viz. 35–45 kcal/g and 1.2–1.5g/kg protein daily. Small meals evenly distributed throughout the day and a late-night snack of complex carbohydrates will help minimize protein utilization. Compliance is, however, likely to be a problem. Diets rich in vegetables and dairy protein may be beneficial and are therefore recommended, but tolerance varies considerably in relation to the nature of the staple diet. Branched chain amino acid supplements may be of value in the occasional patient intolerant of dietary protein. Increasing dietary fiber may be of value, but the utility of probiotics is, as yet, unclear. Short-term multivitamin supplementation should be considered in patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis. Hyponatremia may worsen HE; it should be prevented as far as possible and should always be corrected slowly.

Conclusion

Effective management of these patients requires an integrated multidimensional approach. However, further research is needed to fill the gaps in the current evidence base to optimize the nutritional management of patients with cirrhosis and HE.

### Sodium homeostasis with chronic sodium loading in preascitic cirrhosis [^111NagS7]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Preascitic cirrhotic patients receiving 200 mmol of sodium daily for seven days remain in positive sodium balance. Thereafter, sodium handling is unknown.

Aim

To assess renal sodium handling in preascitic cirrhosis on a high sodium diet for five weeks.

Methods

Sixteen biopsy proven preascitic cirrhotics were assessed at weekly intervals for five weeks on a diet of 200 mmol sodium/day using a daily weight diary and weekly 24 hour urinary sodium estimations. Fasting supine neurohormone levels were measured at baseline and weekly for five weeks while haemodynamics were measured at baseline and at five weeks.

Results

The daily diet of 200 mmol of sodium resulted in weight gain and a positive sodium balance for three weeks, associated with significant suppression of plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, and a significant rise in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (p < 0.05). Patients' weights plateaued during week 4, associated with complete sodium balance and significant suppression of plasma noradrenaline levels (p < 0.05). This was followed by a negative sodium balance and weight loss, and finally complete sodium balance, again despite a mean net gain of 2.3 (0.3) kg, associated with a return of plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels to within normal ranges. The lack of increase in central blood volume in addition to the persistent increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels indicated that residual volume expansion, consequent to persistent weight gain, was distributed on the venous side of the circulation. No free fluid was seen on repeat abdominal ultrasound after five weeks.

Conclusion

Preascitic cirrhotics have a natriuretic "escape" after three weeks on high sodium dietary intake, associated with elevated plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. With continued suppressed sympathetic activity, preascitics re-establish complete sodium balance but with a net weight gain and presumed increased intravascular volume, but without ascites. This further elucidates the compensated sodium retaining abnormality that characterises preascitic cirrhosis.

### Nursing care of patients with cirrhosis: the liverHope nursing project [^115KhUzL]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nursing Assessment of Patients With Cirrhosis and Ascites/Edema

The main roles of nurses in the assessment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites/edema are to evaluate patients' history, check current status of ascites and edema, and plan future care to prevent recurrence. If the patient has significant lower extremity edema, leg wraps should be applied to prevent fluid from continuing to accumulate and to attempt to force the fluid to be re‐absorbed. Leg wraps can be high‐stretch (nonambulatory patient) or short‐stretch (ambulatory patient). A foam or cotton wrap should be applied as a barrier between the patient's skin and the leg wrap itself. Education should be provided to the patient's caregiver about how to successfully apply leg wraps and what complications to monitor for at home. While in hospital, nursing staff assess the patient's skin on their legs a minimum of 3 times per day to ensure that no wounds are forming and skin breakdown is not occurring. Any open wound is a contraindication to leg wrap application. Capillary refill, foot/leg/ankle mobility, sensation, and color should be monitored twice per day and as needed. As mentioned previously, hyponatremia is a common problem for patients with fluid overload. Nursing staff must become familiar with precautions taken for these patients, specifically the need for seizure precautions, although they are uncommon. In such situations, seizure pads should be placed on the patient's bed and suction should be set up at the bedside.

Other key aspects for patients with ascites and/or edema include education of the patient and caregiver on a low‐sodium diet, importance of adherence to prescribed diuretics, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), periodic evaluation of body weight, leg wrap application, and contact with the nurse when alarm signs are present, particularly a significant increase in body weight (Table 2).

### The effects of empagliflozin on diuresis and natriuresis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis [^114g39d4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis frequently coexists with impaired glucose metabolism disorders, as approximately one third of such patients exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and another third present with overt diabetes. On the other hand, the presence of hyperglycemia severely alters the prognosis in this setting. However, treatment options for patients with cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain limited, as many of the drugs used in T2DM are contraindicated in patients with advanced liver disease.

Sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) are a class of glucose-lowering medication that acts on the renal proximal convoluted tubule, independently of insulin, by promoting glycosuria and natriuresis, contributing to glycemic control by reducing HbA1c by 0.6–1%. Beyond their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2-i have been shown to ameliorate outcomes in heart failure (HF), by reducing all-cause mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF and either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of T2DM. The mechanism of their cardioprotective action has not been yet fully elucidated. The reduction in hospitalizations for HF could be related to a reduction in preload and/or afterload, and improvement in left ventricular contractility, while it appears that the positive outcomes in HF come from reducing preload by increasing, at least, short-term natriuresis and osmotic diuresis. Congestive HF and decompensated cirrhosis share some common pathophysiological features and pharmacological treatment. In both entities, though for different reasons, there is a reduction in effective blood volume, which leads to activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system and antidiuretic hormone secretion. In HF, loop diuretics (furosemide, torasemide and bumetanide) are routinely used to treat volume overload, while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are a first-line treatment option in HF with reduced ejection fraction. Similarly, spironolactone is also a first-line option in decompensated cirrhosis with ascites and/or edema, whereas furosemide is used on top of spironolactone in cases of ascites unresponsive to salt-restricted diet and MRAs.

### First-in-man demonstration of direct endothelin-mediated natriuresis and diuresis [^113d966w]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Natriuretic Effect of Big ET-1

As hypothesized, big ET-1 infusion led to a significant natriuresis as shown by the increases in both UNaV and FeNa of ≈40% from baseline. If this was maintained over a 24-hour period, it would amount to ≈60 mmol of sodium excreted in the urine and is broadly equivalent to the natriuresis elicited by a single 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Our subjects were healthy and relatively sodium restricted (with a sodium intake of ≈90 mmol Na or ≈5 g NaCl per day, ≈50% of that contained in a standard Western diet); it is unclear whether the natriuretic effect of ET-1 would be different on a high-salt diet or in patient populations in which there is activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, such as in congestive heart failure, CKD, or liver cirrhosis. This would be of particular interest, because maximizing renal salt and water excretion is an important focus of clinical management in these patient groups.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112Awd3N]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. It accounted for 29,165 deaths in 2007, with a mortality rate of 9.7 per 100,000 persons. Alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis, although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is emerging as an increasingly important cause. Primary care physicians share responsibility with specialists in managing the most common complications of the disease, screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, and preparing patients for referral to a transplant center. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma with imaging studies every six to 12 months. Causes of hepatic encephalopathy include constipation, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and noncompliance with medical therapy. These should be sought and managed before instituting the use of lactulose or rifaximin, which is aimed at reducing serum ammonia levels. Ascites should be treated initially with salt restriction and diuresis. Patients with acute episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding should be monitored in an intensive care unit, and should have endoscopy performed within 24 hours. Physicians should also be vigilant for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Treating alcohol abuse, screening for viral hepatitis, and controlling risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are mechanisms by which the primary care physician can reduce the incidence of cirrhosis.

### Clinical implications with tolvaptan on monitored bioimpedance-defined fluid status in patients with cirrhotic ascites: an observational study [^117BEPBR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tolvaptan regimen and data sampling

All the study subjects were admitted and continued taking the same dose of conventional diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone, or both,) after the add-on of tolvaptan at a low dose. All admitted study subjects were on sodium-restricted diets (less than 102 mmol/L Na per day). Water restriction was not forced, and therefore, daily water intake was not monitored. Enrolled study subjects were advised about sodium restriction by a team of clinical dietitians at multiple time points including at admission, and they were monitored on their adherence to diet advices by the nursing team. Tolvaptan was initiated orally at a dose of 3.75 mg once per day, on the first day after breakfast. The dose may be increased to 7.5 mg once per day on the fourth day, if no adverse effects were observed. The doses from 3.75 to 7.5 mg are relatively low as compared to the doses (30 to 60 mg) approved for hyponatremia in the United States or in the European Union. Serial blood tests were performed to monitor a possible abrupt elevation of serum sodium, and the onset of hepatic or renal dysfunction. The induction protocol for tolvaptan was managed mainly according to the instructions of the latest clinical practice guidelines for liver cirrhosis in Japan. Since tolvaptan has been reported that free water excretion was noticed after 24 h of the first dose, body weight, blood/urine sampling, and measurement of the body composition and fluid volumes (described later) were performed at five different time points: immediately before the start of tolvaptan (time point = 0 h); 6 h after the initial dose of tolvaptan (6 h); 1 day after the initial dose of tolvaptan (24 h; on day two), 3 days after the initial dose of tolvaptan (72 h; on day four); and 7 days after the initial dose of tolvaptan (168 h, on day eight). Please refer to Figure S 2 for the schema of data sampling.

### Consensus care recommendations for alfapumpin cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites [^114R8cb4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

Pre-implantation: patient selection

The alfapump ® was developed for treatment of refractory ascites (RA) and "recurrent ascites", a condition which does not fit the definition of RA but requires > 3 paracenteses per year despite diuretics and a low sodium diet. Its use is indicated mainly for RA and recurrent ascites with contraindications for insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS), including, but not limited to, advanced liver disease (model of end-stage liver disease [MELD] score ≥ 18/Child–Pugh class C), advanced age, cardiac/pulmonary/renal dysfunction, malignant disease, previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy and bacterial infection. A summary of indications and contraindications for alfapump ® treatment is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of indications and contra-indications

Nutritional status and frailty of the patient are important, and it is pointed out that a computed tomography (CT) scan to assess sarcopenia can be performed as for guidance in the decision-making process.

Patients with significant peripheral oedema are difficult to manage due to pre-existing fluid balance issues. In case of ongoing SBP, a stand down period of one week following successful treatment is recommended. A urologist should assess prostate-related obstructive uropathy in men. Patients who exhibit septated or loculated ascites and untreated obstructive uropathy should be definitively excluded. Sarcopenic patients who are bedbound (frailty score 4), those with established hepatorenal syndrome and those unsuitable for anaesthesia should not be definitively excluded but extreme caution is advised.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112cqFbQ]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/day). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case-by-case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

Absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by proteinuria (> 500 mg/day) or microhaematuria (> 50 red blood cells per high-power field) and/or a normal renal ultrasonography

Early intervention in patients with AKI can prevent further deterioration in renal function leading to renal failure. Initial management of AKI should include suspension of all diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated with 0.9% saline or 5% albumin, giving boluses of 250 mL with regular volume status reassessment aiming to achieve euvolaemia with a urine output of > 0.5 mL/kg/h based on dry weight. Accurate fluid balance monitoring and daily weight charts should be commenced. Usually 1–2 L of intravenous fluid will correct most losses and render the patient euvolaemic. If after 6 h the target urine output is not achieved, or the patient's clinical parameters are worsening, then escalation to high-dependency care for more invasive monitoring, inotropic support or renal support should be considered.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and can be caused by multiple factors including: hormonal dysregulation of salt and water balance in response to portal hypertension, dehydration, treatment with diuretics, infections and excessive use of hypotonic fluids, such as 5% dextrose. Patients with serum sodium levels < 125 mmol/L are at risk of seizures. A careful history, clinical examination, medication review and review of other biochemistry are essential to determine the cause of hyponatraemia. Assessment of the patient's volume status is fundamental, and subjects who are hypovolaemic should be fluid-resuscitated. Patients with hypervolaemic hyponatraemia should be treated with fluid restriction. However, it should be noted that some patients with significant ascites, peripheral oedema and low serum albumin levels who appear hypervolaemic are actually intravascularly deplete, and treatment with intravenous albumin can correct the hyponatraemia. Correction of hyponatraemia should be slow (< 10 mmol/L increase per 24 h), as rapid changes in serum sodium can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Safety and efficacy of continuous infusion terlipressin (BIV201): a phase 2 trial in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory ascites [^112HjRqd]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

As noted above, the interpretation of these results is limited by several considerations. First, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect statistically significant between-groups effects. The small sample size was partly a consequence of the study design, which aimed to obtain estimates on which to base a larger and sufficiently powered efficacy trial, and partly due to the premature termination of enrollment after 15 of the planned 30 patients were enrolled. Additionally, only half of the patients in the BIV201+SOC completed 2 full cycles of active treatment, and there were potentially meaningful between-groups differences in disease characteristics at baseline, such as the need for TP. Second, there are potentially confounding factors that were not monitored and could have impacted the study's results, such as adherence to a sodium-restricted diet or alcohol consumption, although patients were excluded from the study if they were judged to have been excessive alcohol drinkers within 12 weeks of enrollment.

Despite these limitations, there were some numerical trends in favor of BIV201+SOC versus SOC in the prespecified subgroup analysis that warrant further investigation into the impact of continuous infusion of BIV201 on clinical outcomes. The observed safety profile suggests that BIV201 was well tolerated, with no new serious risks identified. The design of a new phase 3 study, which evaluates the efficacy and safety of BIV201 and employs a multi-day drug format, will benefit from the information and experiences obtained from this study.

### Cardiovascular effects of canrenone in patients with preascitic cirrhosis [^1145CsEW]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, standing induces a reduction in cardiac index (CI) and an increase in systemic vascular resistance index. Our previous studies indicate that this abnormal hemodynamic response to standing is due to an altered myocardial function, because cirrhotic patients are unable to compensate for the reduced preload with an increase in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume. To evaluate whether the cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis is influenced by canrenone, an aldosterone antagonist, 8 patients with preascitic, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, and portal hypertension underwent echocardiographic assessment of LV function and systemic hemodynamics and determinations of plasma volume, urinary sodium excretion, and plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), and norepinephrine (PNE) when on a 150-mmol/d-sodium diet (baseline), after 1 month on canrenone (100 mg/d) plus a 40-mmol/d-sodium diet and after 1 month on canrenone plus a 150-mmol/d-sodium diet. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed with the patient in the supine position and during active standing. At baseline, patients had high plasma volume and normal renal function, PRA, PAC, and PNE. CI, LVEF, and stroke volume index were also normal. Standing caused a significant reduction in CI and LVEF. After canrenone and either sodium diet, CI significantly decreased, and PRA and PNE increased in the supine position. On standing, LVEF and CI did not decrease further. Plasma volume significantly decreased only after low-sodium diet plus canrenone. In conclusion, canrenone normalizes the cardiac response to the postural challenge in patients with preascitic cirrhosis.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1163W3bL]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Urinary sodium assessment to guide diuretics — Determination of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion can be useful during management of ascites and in adjusting diuretic dose; in patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, urinary sodium excretion lower than daily sodium intake (e.g., 80 mmol/day) indicates an insufficient diuretic dose, while persistent ascites despite adequate urinary sodium excretion indicates dietary indiscretion. When a 24-hour urine collection is not feasible, a random spot urine sodium concentration greater than the potassium (K) concentration correlates well with 24-hour sodium excretion; when the spot urine sodium (Na)/K ratio is > 1 the patient should be losing fluid weight, whereas if the spot urine Na/K ratio is ≤ 1 there is insufficient natriuresis and an increase in diuretics should be considered.

### Normal protein diet for episodic hepatic encephalopathy: results of a randomized study [^117BgHrb]. Journal of Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Protein-restricted diets are usually prescribed for cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy. However, protein restriction may worsen the nutritional status without resulting in an improvement of hepatic encephalopathy. We designed a study to assess the effects of the amount of protein in the diet on the evolution of episodic hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

Cirrhotics admitted to the hospital because of an episode of encephalopathy (n = 30) were randomized to receive a low-protein diet with progressive increments or a normal protein diet for 14 days, in addition to standard measures to treat hepatic encephalopathy. Protein synthesis and breakdown were studied at day 2 and day 14 with the glycine-N(15) infusion method.

Results

The outcome of hepatic encephalopathy was not significantly different between both groups of treatment. Protein synthesis was similar for low and normal protein diet, but those of the low-protein diet group showed higher protein breakdown.

Conclusions

Diets with a normal content of protein, which are metabolically more adequate, can be administered safely to cirrhotic patients with episodic hepatic encephalopathy. Restriction of the content of protein of the diet does not appear to have any beneficial effect for cirrhotic patients during an episode of encephalopathy.

### Sodium retention in heart failure and cirrhosis: potential role of natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid antagonist? [^116CoE6A]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis and heart failure (HF) share the pathophysiology of decreased effective arterial blood volume because of splanchnic vasodilatation in cirrhosis and decreased cardiac output in HF, with resultant stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Hyperaldosteronism plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ascites and contributes to resistance to loop diuretics. Therefore, the use of high doses of aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone up to 400 mg/day) is the main therapy to produce a negative sodium balance in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Hyperaldosteronism also has increasingly been recognized as a risk factor for myocardial and vascular fibrosis. Therefore, low-dose aldosterone antagonists are being used in patients with HF for cardioprotective action. However, the doses (25 to 50 mg/day) at which they are being used in cardiac patients as reported in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study are not natriuretic. It is likely, therefore, that the mortality benefit relates primarily from their effect on cardiac and vascular fibrosis. Resistance to commonly used loop diuretics is frequently present in patients with advanced HF. In patients with decompensated HF with volume overload who are loop diuretic resistant, ultrafiltration may be the only available option. This is, however, an invasive procedure. For these patients, natriuretic doses of aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone > 50 mg/day) may be a potential option. The competitive natriuretic response of aldosterone antagonists is related to activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: the higher the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity, the higher the dose of aldosterone antagonist required to produce natriuresis. This article will discuss the potential use of natriuretic doses of aldosterone antagonists in patients with HF, including the potential side effect of hyperkalemia.

### AHA / ASA guidelines on prevention of recurrent stroke… [^111nRxLM]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Treatable Vascular Risk Factors HYPERTENSION Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of stroke by 30 to 40 percent. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends lifestyle modifications to manage hypertension. Lifestyle changes associated with a reduction in blood pressure include losing weight; restricting salt intake; consuming a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products; participating in regular aerobic exercise; and limiting alcohol intake. Although there is a lack of definitive data addressing the management of hypertension immediately following a stroke, a meta-analysis of randomized trials found that treatment with antihypertensive medications significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke.

The reduction in risk was seen in patients taking diuretics alone and in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but not in patients taking beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone. Statin therapy is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, even without known coronary heart disease, to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events. The National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III recommends reducing low-density lipoprotein levels as the primary target in managing dyslipidemia. Lifestyle modifications that include decreasing saturated fat and cholesterol intake, achieving ideal body weight, and increasing physical activity are also recommended. Diet, exercise, and use of medications that enhance insulin sensitivity have been shown to benefit persons with metabolic syndrome. Adverse effects associated with ticlopidine use include diarrhea and rash.

Ticlopidine is also associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Rates of gastrointestinal bleeding are similar or lower in patients taking ticlopidine than in patients taking aspirin. Clopidogrel. Two trials have evaluated the use of clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention. One trial compared clopidogrel with aspirin alone, and the other with combination aspirin/dipyridamole. Results from both trials found that rates of primary outcomes were similar between treatment groups. Adverse effects of clopidogrel include diarrhea and rash, although gastrointestinal symptoms and hemorrhage are less common than in persons taking aspirin. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel, and may also increase the risk of major cardiovascular events when taken with clopidogrel.

### In patients with heart failure, a low-sodium diet does not improve… [^112RqM17]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

American Family Physician associate editor Barry Weiss, MD discussed several studies showing that a low-sodium diet produced no benefits and increased mortality compared to a normal diet in heart failure patients in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Consequently, he advised that "based on current evidence and until further studies are completed, patients with heart failure should probably be discouraged from reducing their sodium consumption to less than 2, 300 mg per day". Two subsequent systematic reviews of studies of dietary sodium restriction in heart failure also questioned low-sodium dogma. A 2018 review of 9 randomized trials with 479 participants with heart failure found insufficient data on cardiovascular-associated and all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction and conflicting evidence on changes in New York Heart Association functional class.

Last month, the Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure trial, with 806 participants from 26 sites in Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and New Zealand reported its primary findings. All participants in this pragmatic randomized trial were receiving optimally tolerated guideline-directed medical treatment for chronic heart failure. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or a low sodium diet of < 100 mmol/day. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, emergency department visit, and all-cause mortality within 12 months. Median sodium intake decreased in the low-sodium group from 2, 286 mg to 1, 658 mg/day and in the usual care group from 2, 119 mg to 2, 073 mg/day by the end of the trial. However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, researchers found no statistical differences between the groups in the composite outcome or in each of the individual outcomes. As Dr.

Weiss cautioned in his AFP editorial, "the possibility that aggressive sodium restriction may lead to unfavorable outcomes in patients with heart failure should not. be misconstrued as meaning that we should lose our focus on reducing sodium intake in the general population. " Indeed, there is good evidence that population-level interventions are effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, including a large Chinese randomized trial of a salt substitute that Dr.

### Reduced dietary salt for patients with chronic kidney disease… [^111n7dk4]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does reducing dietary salt intake lower blood pressure or albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease. Evidence-Based Answer In patients with CKD, reducing dietary salt intake by approximately 4. 2 g per day lowers mean systolic blood pressure by
6. 9 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3. 9 mm Hg compared with patients on a higher salt diet. In patients with CKD who do not have end-stage renal disease, a low-salt diet also decreases mean albuminuria by 36% compared with a higher salt diet.

1. Study duration ranged from one to 36 weeks, with a median of seven weeks. The four-week mark was used as the cut-off to classify short-term vs. long-term intervention.

Methods used to determine sodium intake were heterogeneous and included either 24-hour urine sodium excretion or the use of food records or 24-hour patient recall. In six studies of 436 participants, reducing dietary salt intake decreased the 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients with CKD stages 1 to 4. Symptomatic hypotension occurred more often with reduced salt intake based on data from six studies of 478 participants with CKD stages 1 to 4 in short-term and long-term interventions. The recorded symptomatic hypotension episodes were mild. Another meta-analysis of 11 RCTs of 738 patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 showed improvements in blood pressure and proteinuria with moderate dietary salt reduction.

3 Considering these data, there is strong evidence that lower dietary salt intake decreases blood pressure, and moderate evidence that it lowers proteinuria in patients with CKD. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recommends total dietary salt intake of less than 2, 300 mg per day for patients with CKD. 4.
