## Question

most common cause croup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most common cause of croup is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying clinical syndrome and typical viral etiologies. Then, I should verify high-level summaries and systematic reviews that quantify causative agents. Next, I'll cross-check with epidemiologic studies and narrative reviews for consistency. After that, I need to consider cohort-specific or seasonal variations that might look contradictory at first glance. Finally, I will synthesize these findings into a clear, reference-supported conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: croup is an acute viral laryngotracheitis causing subglottic edema with barky cough and inspiratory stridor, most commonly in young children; laboratory testing is rarely required because management is clinical, and corticosteroids benefit all severities while epinephrine is reserved for moderate to severe cases [^1135WSUU].

> Now, I should verify the leading etiologic agent from high-level evidence. Wait, let me verify the numbers: a Clinical Evidence review reports that approximately 75% of croup infections are caused by parainfluenza viruses, which provides a quantitative anchor for "most common" and aligns with longstanding clinical teaching [^116rmBQm].

> Next, I need to check whether a specific subtype predominates. The Cochrane review on humidified air explicitly notes that parainfluenza virus type 1 is the agent most commonly identified in croup, which fits with the typical autumn biennial peaks clinicians see; hold on, I should double-check that this aligns with other summaries, but this has been consistently cited across the literature [^1116k3cH].

> I will now examine corroborating epidemiology and reviews to ensure consistency. Multiple sources independently describe parainfluenza as the typical cause: pediatric infectious disease reviews underscore parainfluenza as the characteristic driver, time-series analyses of croup presentations align with parainfluenza seasonality, and broader respiratory virus overviews reiterate that HPIVs — especially types 1 and 2 — are linked to croup in children, which triangulates well with the systematic figures above [^115bonUp] [^114FTk24] [^117WvH1V].

> But wait, what if some cohorts show different leading pathogens? I need to check cohort-specific data. A Korean hospitalized cohort found parainfluenza type 1 in 24.2% — the single most common pathogen — while also identifying HCoV-NL63 and influenza A, suggesting that in hospitalized or outbreak-specific settings, the proportional breakdown can shift without overturning the general predominance of parainfluenza overall; similarly, infant-only cohorts sometimes show higher detection of rhinovirus in croup presentations, reflecting age-specific virology and case mix rather than a global etiologic shift [^111X5WbY] [^113XCGPY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in the SARS-CoV-2 era. I should review Omicron-era data. Several series document a surge of COVID-19–associated croup during Omicron with greater illness severity markers, but even these reports frame SARS-CoV-2 as an emergent contributor rather than the dominant historical cause; importantly, narrative summaries produced during Omicron still cite approximately three quarters of croup being due to parainfluenza, supporting that HPIV remains the most common cause despite COVID-associated spikes in certain waves [^112hyrsW] [^112ig8U9] [^1119LMh2].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my conclusion is precise and reference-aligned. Across systematic summaries and corroborating epidemiology, the most common cause of croup is parainfluenza virus, with type 1 the predominant subtype and an estimated contribution around 75% overall, acknowledging that proportions vary by age, setting, geography, and season without displacing HPIV from the top position [^116rmBQm] [^1116k3cH] [^115bonUp] [^114FTk24] [^117WvH1V].

---

The most common cause of croup is **parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1)**, accounting for the majority of cases in children aged 6 months to 3 years [^1135WSUU]. Both **HPIV-2 and HPIV-3** are also frequent causes [^notfound], while other viruses such as RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 [^114bcdKK] [^116wJuxj] are less common but can cause more severe disease [^112ig8U9]. Croup is typically self-limited [^114bcdKK] and managed with corticosteroids [^1135rg8M] and nebulized epinephrine when indicated [^1135WSUU].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Age group**: Most commonly affects children aged 6 months to 3 years [^1135WSUU] [^114bcdKK].
- **Symptoms**: Barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction [^114bcdKK].
- **Seasonality**: Peaks in fall and early winter, correlating with HPIV circulation [^114FTk24].

---

## Viral etiologies of croup

| **Virus** | **Frequency** | **Clinical severity** |
|-|-|-|
| HPIV-1 | Most common | Mild to moderate |
| HPIV-2 | Common | Mild to moderate |
| HPIV-3 | Less common | Moderate to severe |
| RSV | Less common | Moderate to severe |
| Influenza | Less common | Moderate to severe |
| SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron) | Rare | Severe |

- **HPIV-1**: Most frequently identified virus in croup, especially in hospitalized children [^111X5WbY].
- **HPIV-2 and HPIV-3**: Also common causes, with HPIV-3 associated with more severe cases.
- **RSV and influenza**: Less common but can cause severe croup, particularly in younger children or those with underlying conditions.
- **SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron)**: Recently identified as a cause of severe croup, often requiring intensive care and prolonged hospitalization.

---

## Pathophysiology

The **mechanism** involves viral infection that causes inflammation and edema of the subglottic region, narrowing the airway and producing characteristic symptoms. The **severity** correlates with the degree of obstruction and guides the need for intervention [^112vxggw].

---

## Clinical management

- **Corticosteroids**: Mainstay of treatment [^1135rg8M], reducing symptoms, return visits, and hospital stay [^1154EgXK] [^113GhhoP].
- **Nebulized epinephrine**: Used for moderate to severe cases, providing rapid symptom relief [^1135WSUU].
- **Supportive care**: Humidified air and supportive measures may provide symptomatic relief, though evidence is limited [^1116k3cH] [^1179EuAJ].

---

## Conclusion

The most common cause of croup is **parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1)**; **HPIV-2 and HPIV-3** also contribute substantially. Other viruses — including RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 — are less common but may cause more severe disease.

### Croup [^116rmBQm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Croup is characterized by the abrupt onset, most commonly at night, of a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction. It leads to signs of upper airway obstruction and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children per year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by the parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe upper airway obstruction can, rarely, lead to respiratory failure and arrest.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with mild croup and moderate to severe croup? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids (dexamethasone, intramuscular and oral), nebulised budesonide, oral prednisone.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^1135rg8M]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

For children with croup, do glucocorticoids reduce clinical symptoms, minimize return visits, and/or (re)admissions to the hospital, shorten lengths of stay, or reduce the need for additional treatments?

- **Bottom line**: Glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at 2 hours and for at least 24 hours, reduce return visits to care, and shorten hospital stays by about 15 hours. Serious adverse events are infrequent.

### Croup [^114bcdKK]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Most children who present with the acute onset of barky cough, stridor, and chest-wall indrawing have croup. A careful history and physical examination is the best method to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out potentially serious alternative disorders such as bacterial tracheitis and other rare causes of upper-airway obstruction. Epinephrine delivered via a nebulizer is effective for temporary relief of symptoms of airway obstruction. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, and benefit is seen in children with all levels of severity of croup, including mild cases.

### Role of human coronavirus NL63 in hospitalized children with croup [^111X5WbY]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has recently been implicated as a common cause of croup in children. This study was performed to evaluate viruses associated with croup in children, with an emphasis on HCoV-NL63.

- **Methods**: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from 182 children hospitalized with croup at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2005 to June 2009. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was conducted for detection of 11 respiratory viruses, and medical records were reviewed.

- **Results**: Viruses were identified in 147 (80.8%) of the 182 croup patients. The three most commonly detected viruses were parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) in 44 (24.2%) patients, HCoV-NL63 in 30 (16.5%) patients, and influenza A virus in 25 (13.7%) patients. Other detected viruses were rhinovirus in 22 (12.1%) patients, PIV type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus in 15 (8.2%) patients, human bocavirus in 8 (4.4%) patients, and several others in a few patients. Coinfections with two or more viruses were found in 20 (11%) patients. HCoV-NL63 was identified primarily in winter, which coincides with the peak occurrence of croup. Patients with HCoV-NL63 infection were younger than those who were positive for PIV1 (median age 13 months versus 21 months, P = 0.006) and had shorter fever duration than those with influenza A virus infection (median 1.5 days versus 4 days, P = 0.000).

- **Conclusions**: PIV1 and HCoV-NL63 were most commonly associated with patients who were hospitalized with croup. HCoV-NL63 is prevalent in winter and is associated with younger patients.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^116wJuxj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides valuable insights into the clinical presentation, severity, and management outcomes of children hospitalized with croup during the peak of the Omicron variant surge. By comparing PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases, we identified several critical differences that underscore the unique impact of the Omicron variant on pediatric croup.

The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the Omicron group, which also required more intensive treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and repeat corticosteroid doses. This observation may reflect the increased severity of symptoms in the Omicron group, as indicated by their higher need for interventions. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, it is not possible to determine whether the longer hospital stay was influenced by government-mandated quarantine policies or solely due to symptom persistence requiring prolonged medical care. This uncertainty is acknowledged as a limitation of our study, and future prospective studies should explore the impact of quarantine advisories on hospitalization duration to better delineate this relationship.

Our findings demonstrated that children in the Omicron group were significantly younger than those in the non-Omicron group. This observation aligns with global reports suggesting that younger children, particularly those under five years old, are at higher risk of hospitalization during the Omicron wave. The Omicron variant's tropism for the upper respiratory tract may exacerbate airway inflammation in this vulnerable age group, leading to more severe outcomes.

### Diurnal variation in frequency and severity of croup in the emergency department [^116E6Yrn]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) presentation for croup is thought to occur more often at night, but evidence for its diurnal variation is sparse. Our objectives were to describe the diurnal patterns of ED presentation in children with croup and to determine whether the time of arrival is associated with severe clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We included children 3 months to 11 years of age with an ED encounter for croup from 2016 through 2020. We quantified ED encounters by arrival hour and used generalized linear mixed-effects models to determine the association between arrival time and racemic epinephrine use, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and revisits.

- **Results**: There was considerable diurnal variation in ED visits for croup. A total of 126,186 children (60.1%) presented to the ED at night (between 8 pm and 8 am), and 83,763 children (39.9%) presented during the day. Peak arrival time was 12:00 am with 14,189 encounters, and the nadir was at 2:00 pm with 5,231 encounters. Children presenting during overnight hours had increased odds of the use of racemic epinephrine (odds ratio [OR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.30–1.36), but reduced odds of hospitalization (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73–0.78), ICU admission (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58–0.68), and 3-day ED revisits (OR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83–0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Children with croup present to the ED more commonly at night. Children presenting to the ED with croup at night have greater odds of being treated with racemic epinephrine.

### Croup: Diagnosis and management [^117GRHgK]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances of laryngitis, particularly in patients with acute laryngotracheitis, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend administering nebulized epinephrine to patients with moderate-to-severe croup.

### Storytelling as a communication tool for health consumers: Development of an intervention for parents of children with croup. Stories to communicate health information [^114DFnf9]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A second challenge was staying true to the story versus being evidence-based. For instance, in one case, the child was given an x-ray, despite the fact that this is not standard practice for croup and does not conform to accepted clinical practice guidelines. Our dilemma was whether to recount the events as described by this parent or reflect accepted clinical practice in the form of composite narratives. In the end, we did not include the x-ray account and aimed to make the stories reflect typical cases of mild, moderate, and severe disease and how they would be managed on average.

Another example was a situation where a child had been misdiagnosed prior to the emergency department visit. We had to consider whether it was appropriate to point out that physicians may make errors in diagnosis. We decided to include the incident in the story to highlight a relatively common error of misdiagnosing croup for asthma. It also provided an opportunity in the story to educate the parents around the differences between croup and asthma, and particularly the different treatments appropriate for each.

Another dilemma regarding being evidence-based was whether or not to describe interventions for which there was no evidence. For instance, there is widespread practice and recommendations around the use of mist or humidity for croup despite no research evidence supporting its effectiveness. A further issue was around the naming of drugs in the stories and the potential perception of product placement. For example, many parents would be more familiar with "Tylenol" than "acetaminophen". We chose to use the trade name.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^111Apnz8]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 111 children diagnosed with croup were included in the study, comprising 30 patients with positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron group) and 81 patients with negative PCR results (non-Omicron group). The mean age of patients in the Omicron group was significantly younger at 16.93 ± 24.80 months compared to 32.58 ± 37.26 months in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.049). Gender distribution was comparable between the groups, with 66.7% male and 33.3% female in the Omicron group versus 65.4% male and 34.6% female in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.903).

- **Symptom severity and Westley croup scores**: Symptom severity, assessed using the Westley Croup Score, demonstrated significant differences between the groups. Moderate to severe symptoms were more common in the Omicron group, with 53.4% classified as moderate and 20% as severe. In contrast, the majority of the non-Omicron group (67.9%) exhibited mild symptoms, with only 23.5% classified as moderate and 8.6% as severe (p = 0.001).

- **Hospitalization and treatment indicators**: The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the Omicron group, averaging 2.59 ± 3.93 days, compared to 2.11 ± 2.75 days in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.016). Similarly, the use of nebulized epinephrine was more intensive in the Omicron group.

### Stridor is not always croup [^116XhfHo]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress and stridor are common presenting symptoms for children in the emergency department. Most of these children will have common illnesses such as bronchiolitis or croup. Clinicians, however, must maintain a broad differential diagnosis and a healthy skepticism in the approach to each child's case so as not to miss uncommon or atypical presentations. We describe the case of a child with stridor in whom an airway hemangioma was ultimately diagnosed.

### Pulmonary arterial pressure in children with croup syndrome [^113yDjAi]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Croup syndrome, or laryngotracheitis, is one of the frequent causes of transient upper airway obstruction due to laryngeal and tracheal blockage in infants and children. Such obstruction may lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure in children. This study investigates the relationship between croup syndrome and pulmonary arterial pressure.

Forty children with croup syndrome and fourteen healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study. Twelve patients with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea, cyanosis, and hypoventilation, were categorized as having a "high croup score" (croup score ≥ 6). All patients with a high croup score were treated with dexamethasone. Pulmonary arterial pressure was assessed during therapy using serial echocardiographic measurements.

The results showed that children with croup syndrome had significantly higher pulmonary arterial pressures than healthy subjects at diagnosis. Pressure values in patients with a high croup score were significantly higher compared to the low-score group (P < .05). However, there was no difference between the two groups at the end of therapy.

In conclusion, pulmonary arterial pressure increases to varying extents in the acute stage of illness, correlating with the severity of the disease and the average hospital stay. The increased pulmonary arterial pressure due to croup syndrome is reversible. Moreover, evaluation of children with croup syndrome using Doppler echocardiography is recommended.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^115fGBVs]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

The increased frequency of moderate and severe symptoms in the Omicron group, as indicated by higher Westley Croup Scores, highlights the variant's potential to intensify upper airway inflammation. Previous studies have reported similar findings, suggesting that Omicron-related croup is associated with more pronounced stridor, respiratory distress, and a longer recovery time compared to croup caused by traditional viruses such as parainfluenza. In line with our findings, Lam et al. in a descriptive study among the pediatric population in Hong Kong, found that the COVID-19 incidence among patients with croup was significantly higher in the COVID-19 Omicron group than in the COVID-19 pre-Omicron group.

Hospitalization duration was significantly longer in the Omicron group, which also required more intensive treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and repeat corticosteroid doses. These findings mirror the observations of Scribner et al. (2023), who reported higher rates of prolonged hospital stays and recurrent corticosteroid use in Omicron-associated croup. The prolonged inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may account for these increased treatment demands.

### Storytelling as a communication tool for health consumers: Development of an intervention for parents of children with croup. Stories to communicate health information [^111M2GYL]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Stories may be an effective tool to communicate with and influence patients because of their ability to engage the reader. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a story-based intervention for the delivery of health evidence to parents of children with croup for use in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: A creative writer interviewed parents of children with croup presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) and drafted stories. The stories were revised based on written participant feedback and edited to incorporate research evidence and health information. An illustrator and graphic designer developed story booklets, which were evaluated through focus groups.

- **Results**: Ten participants provided feedback on the five stories drafted by the creative writer. Participants liked the concept but found the writing overly sophisticated and desired more character development along with more medical/health information. They highlighted specific story content that they liked and disliked. The revised stories were evaluated through focus groups involving eight individuals. Feedback was generally positive, although one participant questioned the associated costs. Participants appreciated the graphics and layout, found it easier to identify with the stories, and felt that obtaining information was simpler compared to a standard medical information sheet. They provided feedback on the story content, errors and inconsistencies, and preferences regarding writing style and booklet format. Feedback on how to package the stories was also provided by attendees.

### Review on clinical and molecular epidemiology of human rhinovirus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in African and Southeast Asian children [^115j1VCz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The detection of human rhinoviruses (HRV) is highly prevalent in children with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, acute asthma, and croup; however, there is also evidence that HRV is common in asymptomatic individuals. The majority of studies on the role of different HRV serotypes during acute respiratory tract infection episodes have a limited sample size to fully characterize the epidemiology of HRV infection, including those from low-middle income countries, where the burden of childhood respiratory disease is greatest.

- **Methods**: We systematically reviewed HRV clinical and molecular epidemiology in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Southeast Asia before November 2015.

- **Results**: We identified 31 studies, which included data from 13 African and 6 Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the gaps in knowledge surrounding HRV infections. HRV was one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses detected during childhood respiratory disease (13%-59%); however, many studies could not determine the attributable role of HRV in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory infections due to a high prevalence of detection among asymptomatic individuals (6%-50%). A meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the prevalence of HRV identification between children of different age groups or between children with severe disease compared with asymptomatic children.

- **Conclusions**: These data highlight the need for large-scale surveillance projects to determine the attributable etiologic role of HRV in respiratory disease.

### The cell biology of acute childhood respiratory disease: Therapeutic implications [^116u5YhK]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and the human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) cause most cases of childhood croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Influenza virus also causes a significant burden of disease in young children, although its significance in children was not fully recognized until recently.

This article discusses pathogens that have been studied for several decades, including RSV and HPIVs, and also explores the newly identified viral pathogens, HMPV and human coronavirus NL63. The escalating rate of emergence of new infectious agents, fortunately meeting with equally rapid advancements in molecular methods of surveillance and pathogen discovery, means that new organisms will soon be added to the list.

- **Therapies for bronchiolitis**: This section addresses the final common pathways that can result from infection with diverse pathogens, highlighting the mechanisms that may be amenable to therapeutic approaches.

The article concludes with a discussion of the overarching impact of new diagnostic strategies.

### Out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest in children with croup [^114aQn8f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Viral laryngotracheobronchitis is a ubiquitous infectious process that has not caused significant mortality in the past 20 years. Bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia can complicate viral laryngotracheobronchitis and markedly increase the risk of a bad outcome. Even uncomplicated, properly managed viral laryngotracheobronchitis can occasionally result in death, particularly in the infant age group.

### Viral etiologies of infant bronchiolitis, croup and upper respiratory illness during 4 consecutive years [^113XCGPY]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Prospective data on viral etiology and clinical characteristics of bronchiolitis and upper respiratory illness (URI) in infants are limited.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort enrolled previously healthy term infants during inpatient or outpatient visits for acute URI or bronchiolitis from September to May, 2004 to 2008. Illness severity was determined using an ordinal bronchiolitis severity score. Common respiratory viruses were identified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Of 648 infants, 67% were enrolled during inpatient visits and 33% during outpatient visits. Seventy percent had bronchiolitis, 3% croup, and 27% URI. Among infants with bronchiolitis, 76% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 18% human rhinovirus (HRV), 10% influenza, 2% coronavirus, 3% human metapneumovirus, and 1% parainfluenza virus. Among infants with croup, 39% had HRV, 28% parainfluenza virus, 28% RSV, 11% influenza, 6% coronavirus, and none had human metapneumovirus. Among infants with URI, 46% had HRV, 14% RSV, 12% influenza, 7% coronavirus, 6% parainfluenza virus, and 4% human metapneumovirus. Individual viruses exhibited distinct seasonal, demographic, and clinical expression.

- **Conclusions**: The most common infections among infants seeking care in unscheduled medical visits for URI or bronchiolitis were RSV and HRV. Demographic differences were observed between patients with different viruses, suggesting that host and viral factors play a role in the phenotypic expression of viral illness.

### Pediatric croup with COVID-19 [^112eEvWd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

We describe three previously healthy children, admitted from our emergency department (ED) to our free-standing children's hospital, as the first documented cases of croup as a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All three cases (ages 11 months, 2 years, and 9 years old) presented with non-specific upper-respiratory-tract symptoms that developed into a barky cough with associated stridor at rest and respiratory distress. All were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal samples that were negative for all other pathogens, including the most common etiologies for croup.

Each received multiple (≥ 3) doses of nebulized racemic epinephrine with minimal to no improvement shortly after medication. All had a prolonged period of time from ED presentation until the resolution of their stridor at rest (13, 19, and 21 hours). All received dexamethasone early in their ED treatment and were admitted. All three received at least one additional dose of dexamethasone, an atypical treatment occurrence in our hospital, due to each patient's prolonged duration of symptoms. One child required heliox therapy and admission to intensive care. All patients were eventually discharged.

Pathogen testing is usually not indicated in croup, but with "COVID-19 croup", SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered given the prognostic significance and prolonged quarantine implications. Our limited experience with this newly described COVID-19 croup condition suggests that cases can present with significant pathology and might not improve as rapidly as those with typical croup.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^113a56xC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides critical insights into the distinct clinical and treatment challenges posed by the Omicron variant in pediatric patients with croup. Children with Omicron-related croup were younger, exhibited more severe symptoms, and required intensified therapeutic interventions compared to their non-COVID-19 counterparts. These findings highlight the variant's unique impact on pediatric respiratory conditions, underscoring the importance of early recognition, vigilant monitoring, and tailored management strategies during pandemic surges. Future studies should focus on the long-term outcomes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these observations, paving the way for optimized care protocols and better preparedness for emerging variants.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^113mFuNo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

The method utilized in this study involved a descriptive-analytical design aimed at practical outcomes. It was conducted via a retrospective review of patient records at two major pediatric hospitals: Bahrami Children's Hospital and the Children's Medical Center in Iran. The research compared clinical, laboratory, and treatment outcomes between children hospitalized with croup during the Omicron variant surge, who tested positive versus negative for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study employed a retrospective, descriptive-analytical design, utilizing data extracted from medical records.

Verbal and written informed consent was obtained from the parents for the use of medical records and participation in a brief questionnaire, which gathered additional demographic information not readily available in the medical charts. The questionnaire was used solely for capturing family-related demographic data and did not involve any medical interventions.

- **Study population and sample**: The study included all pediatric patients diagnosed with croup and admitted to the aforementioned hospitals during the peak of the Omicron wave (January 21 to March 20, 2022). Inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of croup based on typical symptoms such as barking cough, stridor, and respiratory distress, and the availability of a nasopharyngeal PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 (either positive or negative).

Exclusion criteria were incomplete or missing clinical and demographic data in medical records and cases managed solely on an outpatient basis without hospitalization.

### Variation and trends in ed use of radiographs for asthma, bronchiolitis, and croup in children [^115GjomL]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives were (1) to determine trends in radiograph use in emergency department (ED) care of children with asthma, bronchiolitis, and croup; and (2) to examine the association of patient and hospital factors with variation in radiograph use.

Methods involved a retrospective, cross-sectional study of National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data between 1995 and 2009. This study focused on radiograph use at ED visits in children aged 2 to 18 years with asthma, aged 3 months to 1 year with bronchiolitis, and aged 3 months to 6 years with croup. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and adjusted for all factors studied.

- **Results**: The use of radiographs for asthma increased significantly over time (OR: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.09; P < .001 for trend) but was unchanged for bronchiolitis and croup. Pediatric-focused EDs had lower use for asthma (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.29–0.68), bronchiolitis (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.23–0.59), and croup (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17–0.68). Compared with the Northeast region, the Midwest and South had statistically higher use of radiographs for all three conditions. The Western region had higher use only for asthma (OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.07–2.60) and bronchiolitis (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.48–5.87). No associations were seen for metropolitan statistical area or hospital ownership status.

- **Conclusions**: The ED use of radiographs for children with asthma increased significantly from 1995 to 2009. Reversing this trend could result in substantial cost savings and reduced radiation. Pediatric-focused EDs used significantly fewer radiographs for asthma, bronchiolitis, and croup.

### Heliox for croup in children [^111zGZmn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Croup is thought to be triggered by a viral infection and is characterized by respiratory distress due to upper airway inflammation and swelling of the subglottic mucosa in children. Mostly, it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care. In moderate to severe cases, treatment with corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline) is required. Corticosteroids improve symptoms, but it takes time for a full effect to be achieved. In the interim, the child is at risk of further deterioration, which may rarely result in respiratory failure, necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation. Nebulized epinephrine may result in dose-related adverse effects, including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension, and its benefit may be short-lived. Helium-oxygen (heliox) inhalation has shown therapeutic benefit in initial treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates. Heliox has been used during emergency transport of children with severe croup, and anecdotal evidence suggests that heliox relieves respiratory distress.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of heliox on relieving symptoms and signs of croup, as determined by a croup score (a tool for measuring the severity of croup). To examine the effect of croup on rates of admission or intubation (or both) through comparisons of heliox with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1950 to October week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to November 2013), CINAH.

### Viral croup [^116bTUvz]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Viral croup is the most common form of airway obstruction in children aged six months to six years. The concerning nature of croup often prompts parents and caregivers to seek physician consultation. For children with mild croup, symptomatic care and mist therapy may be all that is necessary. Epinephrine has been used for decades to treat more severe cases of croup, but recent meta-analyses have found that glucocorticoid use is associated with shorter hospital stays, improvement in croup scores, and less use of epinephrine. Studies have shown that treatment with 0.6 mg per kg of oral dexamethasone is as effective as intramuscular dexamethasone or 2 mg of nebulized budesonide. Oral dexamethasone in dosages as low as 0.15 mg per kg may also be effective. While more studies are needed to establish guidelines, oral dexamethasone can be used to treat mild to moderate croup with close follow-up and instructions for further care, if needed.

### State of the evidence for standard-of-care treatments for croup: Are we where we need to be [^113rysuv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Croup is a term that groups several different clinical syndromes with inspiratory stridor. The failure to delineate the specific syndromes has led to suboptimal treatment in many instances.

- **Methods**: A literature review and personal experience have been analyzed.

- **Results**: Specific croup syndromes have been identified. Most croup steroid-treatment studies have failed to adequately identify the specific illness being treated. With two exceptions, all studies done at the time of writing have been too small to sufficiently evaluate risks of steroids if the risk is 1% or less.

- **Conclusions**: Three conclusions were reached: (1) No steroid treatment studies of moderate or severe laryngotracheitis have been of adequate size to determine the risk of progressive viral infection or secondary bacterial infection; (2) Single dose steroid treatment or limited nebulized use is probably safe; and (3) We should encourage better clinical diagnosis of croup illnesses.

### Croup: Diagnosis and management [^1135WSUU]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Croup is a common respiratory illness affecting 3% of children aged six months to three years and accounts for 7% of hospitalizations annually for fever and/or acute respiratory illness in children younger than five years. It is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction resulting from swelling of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, leading to inspiratory stridor and a barking cough. Many patients experience low-grade fevers, although fever is not necessary for diagnosis. Less commonly, stridor can be associated with acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and foreign body airway obstruction.

Laboratory studies are seldom needed for diagnosing croup. Viral cultures and rapid antigen testing have minimal impact on management and are not routinely recommended. Radiography and laryngoscopy should be reserved for patients in whom alternative diagnoses are suspected.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a single dose of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dexamethasone improves symptoms and reduces return visits and length of hospitalization in children with croup of any severity. In patients with moderate to severe croup, the addition of nebulized epinephrine improves symptoms and reduces length of hospitalization.

### Croup management in Australia and New Zealand: A PREDICT study of physician practice and clinical practice guidelines [^1121287j]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Comparison of clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and reported physician management of croup at PREDICT (Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative) sites serves as a baseline for planned randomized controlled trials. A review was conducted of CPGs for croup from PREDICT sites and involved a survey of specialist pediatric emergency physicians regarding croup management. PREDICT sites included eight tertiary pediatric hospitals and three large mixed emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand.

Nine of the 11 sites had a CPG for croup with a response rate of 94% (78/83). Adrenaline was recommended for moderate croup (3%), severe croup (52%), and life-threatening croup (100%). Steroid therapy was recommended for mild croup (45%), moderate croup (97%), severe croup (97%), and life-threatening croup (96%). The choice of steroid was oral dexamethasone (60%) and oral prednisolone (38%). In cases of severe croup, 77% used intravenous/intramuscular dexamethasone, 10% used intravenous/intramuscular methylprednisolone, and 8% used nebulized budesonide. Common dosage regimens were 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone or 1 mg/kg prednisolone. A standard volume dosage regimen for nebulized adrenaline was used by 54%, whereas 39% used a weight-based formula. Clinical practice guidelines recommended 5 mg (11%) or 10 mg (33%) for standard volume dosing, and all CPGs using weight-based dosing recommended 0.5 mg/kg with maximum doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg.

Croup management at PREDICT emergency departments is similar, based on oral steroids and nebulized adrenaline use and reflects adherence to CPGs.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^1154EgXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay for the treatment of croup. The existing evidence demonstrates that glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of croup in children. However, updating the evidence on their clinical relevance in croup is imperative. This is an update to a review first published in 1999 and updated in 2004, 2011, and 2018.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effects and safety of glucocorticoids in the treatment of croup in children aged 18 years and below.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Library, which includes the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2022 Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 4 March 2022), Embase (Ovid) (1974 to 4 March 2022). We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 4 March 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children (aged 18 years and below) with croup. We assessed the effect of glucocorticoids compared to the following: placebo, any other pharmacologic agents, any other glucocorticoids, any combination of other glucocorticoids, given by different modes of administration, or given in different doses. The included studies must have assessed at least one of our primary outcomes (defined as the change in croup score or return visits, (re)admissions to the hospital, or both) or secondary outcomes (defined as the length of stay in hospital or emergency departments, patient improvement, use of additional treatments, or adverse events).

### Does active dissemination of evidence result in faster knowledge transfer than passive diffusion? An analysis of trends of the management of pediatric asthma and croup in US emergency departments from 1995 to 2009 [^115Aqjkd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare knowledge transfer (KT) in the emergency department (ED) management of pediatric asthma and croup by measuring trends in corticosteroid use for both conditions in EDs. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data between 1995 and 2009 of corticosteroid use at ED visits for asthma or croup was conducted. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using logistic regression. Trends over time were compared using an interaction term between disease and year, and were adjusted for all other covariates in the model. Children aged 2 to 18 years with asthma who received albuterol and were triaged as emergent/urgent, as well as children aged 3 months to 6 years with croup, were included. The main outcome measure was the administration of corticosteroids in the ED or as a prescription at the ED visit.

Corticosteroid use in asthma visits increased from 44% to 67% and from 32% to 56% for croup. After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, this trend was significant both for asthma (OR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.10) and croup (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03–1.12). There was no statistical difference between the two trends (P = 0.69). Hospital location in a metropolitan statistical area was associated with increased corticosteroid use in asthma (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.10–2.82). Factors including sex, ethnicity, insurance, or region of the country were not significantly associated with corticosteroid use.

### A randomized controlled trial of mist in the acute treatment of moderate croup [^1179EuAJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether the use of mist improves clinical symptoms in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with moderate croup, children aged 3 months to 6 years were eligible for the study if they presented to the ED with moderate croup, defined as a croup score of 2–7. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either mist (humidified oxygen) via mist stick or no mist. Croup scores were measured at baseline and every 30 minutes for up to two hours. At these intervals, parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and patient comfort score were also measured. Patients were treated until the croup score was less than 2 or until two hours had elapsed. All patients received an initial dose of oral dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg). Other treatments, such as racemic epinephrine or inhaled budesonide, were given at the discretion of the treating physician. Research assistants were unaware of the assigned treatments.

There were 71 patients enrolled in the study; 35 received mist and 36 received no mist. The two treatment groups had similar characteristics at baseline; the median baseline croup score was 4 in both groups. Outcomes were measured as the change from baseline at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. The change in the croup score from baseline in the mist group was not statistically different from the croup score change in the group that did not receive mist (p = 0.39). There was also no significant difference in the improvement of oxygen saturation, heart rate, or patient comfort scores.

### Clinical features and outcomes of Omicron-associated croup in children [^111jsxLS]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Low credibility.

This study aimed to describe the clinical features and outcomes of Omicron-associated croup in children. A total of 105 children aged 3 to 60 months (median age 11 months) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cough were admitted to our hospital from December 16, 2022, to December 31, 2022. Their clinical features, treatment, and outcomes were reviewed, and these children were followed up for 8 months.

Among the cases, 5 had complex medical histories, while the other children were generally healthy. Out of the cases, 41 (38.3%) had mild, 57 (54.4%) had moderate, and 7 (6.7%) had severe laryngeal obstruction. They developed croup after 1 to 5 days of fever (median 2 days). The majority (90.5%) of COVID-19 children with croup did not have pneumonia, and most (64.8%) had decreased eosinophil counts. Additionally, most other blood routine indicators were normal.

Five other viral infections (Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) were tested in 51 cases, and all results were negative. All cases recovered from croup after receiving prompt nebulization therapy and/or an intravenous drip of hormone. The hospitalization rate was 6.7%.

During the 8-month follow-up period, 71 cases experienced repeated fever due to various infections, but only 4 cases (4/105, 3.8%) had repeated croup. Omicron is a risk factor for croup, with most cases presenting mild to moderate laryngeal obstructions. Co-viral infection testing is unnecessary for such cases.

### Croup associated with SARS-CoV-2: Pediatric laryngotracheitis during the Omicron surge [^116RJp9E]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

In this retrospective analysis, we describe weekly croup and corresponding viral prevalence patterns in a pediatric quaternary care system in metropolitan Atlanta. We characterize a series of 24 patients with croup associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that this clinical presentation increased substantially in frequency during the period of high Omicron vs Delta transmission.

### Croup associated with SARS-CoV-2: Pediatric laryngotracheitis during the Omicron surge [^115gGQtF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

During a 3-week period from December 13, 2021, through January 2, 2022, we observed a substantial increase in croup presentations during a decline in the prevalence of other respiratory viral pathogens known to cause croup. These cases emerged during a surge of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa in November 2021, which became the dominant circulating strain in metropolitan Atlanta by mid-December 2021. Our case series analysis included 24 patients with croup associated with SARS-CoV-2, showing frequent hospitalization (45.8%) and ICU admission (18.2%). However, interpretation of clinical severity is limited by the fact that respiratory viral panel (RVP) testing was conducted in only a fraction of those with croup and was more likely to have been performed in more severely ill patients needing hospital admission.

The Omicron variant has been associated with increased transmissibility and attenuated lower respiratory tract disease compared to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. Although previous reports indicate that croup associated with SARS-CoV-2 presentation likely existed before the emergence of the Omicron variant, its frequency increased substantially during the Omicron outbreak. Additionally, the proportion of 0- to 4-year-old children diagnosed with COVID-19 nearly doubled during the Omicron period compared to the Delta-dominant period. These data underscore the ongoing need for vaccination efforts in this susceptible population. As with any observational data, bias could have influenced the identification of croup and COVID-19 during the Omicron study period.

### Sex differences in pediatric infectious diseases [^115bonUp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Croup, or laryngotracheobronchitis, is the most common cause of airway obstruction in children and is typically caused by a parainfluenza virus infection following a striking seasonal pattern. The age group most affected is 6 months to 6 years. Higher incidence and hospitalization rates have been consistently observed in males. More severe disease is clearly related to sex differences in the respiratory tract anatomy, as described for RSV disease, as well as to differences in antiviral immunity.

The incidence of chickenpox is similar for both sexes during childhood and adolescence. However, a higher proportion of cases occur in females than in males during the reproductive years. This may be due to greater exposure of women to potentially infected children in childcare settings. Furthermore, reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) as shingles occurs more often in women, possibly indicating lower levels of immunity in females. Effective memory T-cell responses are thought to maintain VZV latency by preventing viral reactivation. Indeed, in a recent study in healthy adults, VZV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell responses were detected at higher frequencies in healthy men than in healthy women.

HIV infection shows well-documented sex-specific differences in adults, as reviewed in a separate article that is part of this supplement [insert reference here]. However, the higher CD4+ T-cell counts observed in females are not confined to infected adults. Large studies of HIV-infected children have demonstrated significantly higher CD4+ T-cell counts in vertically infected female subjects.

### High rates of subglottic stenosis seen in African-American children admitted with severe croup to hospitals in the United States between 2003 and 2013 [^111hRGVP]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To assess whether differences exist in the epidemiology and the treatment of croup with respect to gender, race, income, and geographical location, a retrospective weighted analysis was conducted. Patients under 19 admitted with a diagnosis of croup — with a subcohort requiring intubation or diagnostic bronchoscopy — were analyzed using data from the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database from 2003 to 2013. ICD-9 codes and demographics were examined, with cross-tabulations and linear regression modeling performed.

Between 2003 and 2013, 202,188 pediatric patients were admitted with a diagnosis of croup, representing 1 per 100 pediatric admissions. Males were more likely to be admitted for croup than females [OR 2.13 (2.08–2.17)]. The incidence of croup was highest among Caucasians and lowest among Asian and African-American patients. African-American children were more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy or require intubation [OR 1.23 (1.08–1.401)] than children of other races. A higher rate of subglottic stenosis was observed in African-American children requiring bronchoscopy than expected (39.1% vs. 26.7%). However, after controlling for subglottic stenosis, African-American patients were no longer more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy or require intubation than other races [OR 1.129 (0.959–1.33)].

The conclusion drawn is that African-American children admitted with a diagnosis of croup appear to have an increased rate of intubation or bronchoscopy. This may be related to the high incidence of subglottic stenosis within this population. After controlling for subglottic stenosis, no difference was observed in the likelihood of African-American children undergoing these procedures compared to other races.

The study investigated the use of storytelling as an effective communication tool for health information, specifically targeting parents of children with croup. The research involved developing an intervention based on storytelling techniques to enhance understanding and retention of health information among consumers.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patients: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^112aLZvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The greater reliance on nebulized epinephrine suggests a need to address airway inflammation more aggressively in Omicron-related croup cases. This aligns with the findings of Narayanan et al. (2023), who emphasized the elevated use of racemic epinephrine during the Omicron period​. Although ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were not statistically significant between groups, trends indicated a higher proportion of ICU admissions in the Omicron group. This is consistent with global data showing increased ICU utilization during severe cases of Omicron-associated croup. These cases may be driven by a combination of severe airway obstruction and systemic inflammation.

Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in laboratory indices, including WBC, lymphocyte percentages, and CRP levels, between the two groups. This suggests that while clinical severity is higher in Omicron-related croup, systemic inflammatory markers may not reliably differentiate between PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. These results align with findings by Choi et al. (2022), who reported that laboratory indicators alone were insufficient to distinguish Omicron-associated respiratory illnesses. The distinct clinical profile of Omicron-related croup underscores the need for heightened vigilance and a tailored approach to management. Prompt recognition of moderate and severe cases, combined with readiness for escalated treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids, is crucial. These findings also emphasize the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 as a potential ca

### Relation of two different subtypes of croup before age three to wheezing, atopy, and pulmonary function during childhood: a prospective study [^115nc3SK]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Some retrospective evidence suggests that children with a history of croup may be at increased risk of subsequently developing asthma, atopy, and diminished pulmonary function. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of croup (as diagnosed by a physician) in early life.

- **Methods**: Lower respiratory illnesses (LRIs) in the first 3 years of life were assessed in 884 children who were enrolled in a large longitudinal study of airway diseases at birth. Pulmonary function tests, markers of atopy, and wheezing episodes were studied at different ages between birth and 13 years.

- **Results**: Ten percent of children had croup with wheeze (Croup/Wheeze), 5% had croup without wheeze (Croup/No Wheeze), 36% had another LRI (Other LRI), and 48% had no LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently isolated in children with Croup/Wheeze and Other LRI than in those with Croup/No Wheeze. There was no association between croup in early life and markers of atopy measured during the school years. Only children with Croup/Wheeze and with Other LRI had a significant risk of subsequent persistent wheeze later in life. Significantly lower levels of indices of intrapulmonary airway function were observed at ages < 1 (before any LRI), 6, and 11 years in children with Croup/Wheeze and Other LRI compared with children with No LRI. Conversely, inspiratory resistance before any LRI episode was significantly higher in infants who later developed Croup/No Wheeze than in the other 3 groups.

- **Conclusions**: We distinguish two manifestations of croup with and without wheezing.

### Recurrent croup [^113s1ZFV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Croup refers to airway inflammation and edema leading to obstruction of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. It is the most common cause of acute airway obstruction in young children. Croup is characterized by the onset of low-grade fever, barky cough, stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress. Typically, croup is caused by a viral infection (viral croup) but can occur suddenly without a viral prodrome (spasmodic croup).

Recurrent croup is defined as two or more episodes per year. It should be considered a symptom of an underlying structural or inflammatory airway abnormality and should prompt a work-up for the underlying cause.

### Recurrent croup presentation, diagnosis, and management [^115XFs7u]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

The lack of clinical insight into recurrent croup often leads to the underdiagnosis of an upper airway lesion and, subsequently, inadequate treatment. This study examined the underlying etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome of patients with a history of recurrent croup identified at initial presentation. The aim was to present common diagnostic features and suggest new diagnostic and management recommendations.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 17 children diagnosed with recurrent croup. Demographic, historical, and intraoperative data as noted in clinic charts were collected. Specific data included age, sex, chief complaint, presenting symptoms, past medical history, previous medication history, number of emergency room visits and inpatient admissions, tests/procedures performed, and corresponding findings. Additionally, information on treatment given and post-treatment clinical outcome was gathered.

- **Results**: Six (35.3%) patients presented initially with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fourteen (82.3%) patients had positive endoscopic evidence of gastroesophageal reflux. For these 14 patients, 44 laryngopharyngeal reflux lesions were noted, with 32 (72.7%) occurring in the subglottis. All 14 patients demonstrated various degrees of subglottic stenosis, ranging from 30% to 70% (Cotton-Myer grade I-II). All 17 patients (100%) demonstrated subglottic stenosis ranging from 15% to 70% airway narrowing.

- **Conclusions**: A history suggestive of recurrent croup requires close monitoring and expedient direct laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy for diagnosis.

### Croup associated with SARS-CoV-2: Pediatric laryngotracheitis during the Omicron surge [^1119LMh2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

Croup represents inflammation of the subglottic upper airway mucosa in children associated with respiratory distress due to epithelial-level edema and airflow obstruction. The majority of croup presentations to the emergency department (ED) are attributable to acute viral infection. Similar to other viral-associated respiratory illnesses, such as bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbations, croup presentations tend to fluctuate in frequency depending on the local prevalence of specific viral pathogens. Approximately 75% of cases of croup are caused by one of four parainfluenza virus (PIV) subtypes, with the remaining 25% caused by common seasonal respiratory "cold" viruses that are included in standard multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP) testing, including endemic coronaviruses. Before widespread circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, less than 10 cases of croup associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection had been published in which multiplex RVP testing was used to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA while excluding other viral etiologies.

Between December 13, 2021, and January 2, 2022, as metropolitan Atlanta experienced a sudden spike in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases, clinicians within our system noted an unexpected increase in ED presentations of croup. We, therefore, sought to (1) characterize the clinical features of croup associated with SARS-CoV-2 in a series of children presenting during the period of high Omicron variant transmission and (2) identify ED visits for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare the frequency of croup among these children during this Omicron-dominated period.

### Respiratory emergencies in children [^115NLgpY]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Acute obstructive respiratory emergencies in children are a common cause of emergency department visits. The severity of these conditions ranges from mild, self-limited disease to life-threatening forms of rapidly progressive airway obstruction. A high index of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses general principles of assessing and managing respiratory emergencies in children, as well as clinical characteristics and treatment of specific conditions such as croup, epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, retropharyngeal abscess, foreign bodies, and inhalational injuries.

### Identifying susceptibility of children and adolescents to the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) [^1142YTkw]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is estimated to be more transmissible than previous strains of SARS-CoV-2, especially among children, potentially resulting in croup, which is a characteristic disease in children. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among children might be higher because (i) school-aged children have higher contact rates and (ii) the COVID-19 vaccination strategy prioritizes the elderly in most countries. However, there have been no reports confirming the age-varying susceptibility to the Omicron variant at the time of writing.

- **Methods**: We developed an age-structured compartmental model, combining an age-specific contact matrix in South Korea and the observed distribution of periods between each stage of infection in the national epidemiological investigation. A Bayesian inference method was used to estimate the age-specific force of infection and, accordingly, age-specific susceptibility, given epidemic data during the third (pre-Delta), fourth (Delta-driven), and fifth (Omicron-driven) waves in South Korea. As vaccine uptake increased, individuals who were vaccinated were excluded from the susceptible population in accordance with vaccine effectiveness against the Delta and Omicron variants, respectively.

- **Results**: A significant difference between the age-specific susceptibility to the Omicron variant and that to the pre-Omicron variants was found in the younger age group. The rise in susceptibility to the Omicron/pre-Delta variant was highest in the 10–15 years age group (5.28 times [95% CI, 4.94–5.60]), and the rise in susceptibility to the Omicron/Delta variant was observed to be significant as well.

### Severe human parainfluenza virus community- and healthcare-acquired pneumonia in adults at tertiary hospital, Seoul, South Korea, 2010–2019 [^117WvH1V]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections, such as croup in children and pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. HPIV is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family and is classified into four major serotypes, HPIV-1–4, according to complement fixation and hemagglutinating antigens. HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 belong to the genus Respirovirus, whereas HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 belong to the genus Rubulavirus. HPIV-3 is the most common serotype associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 are usually associated with croup in children.

HPIV infections are generally mild and self-limiting in adults; however, HPIV-associated pneumonia has been increasingly reported. HPIV accounts for 2.0%–7.6% of pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 3.4%–6.1% of pathogens causing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of severe HPIV-associated pneumonia in adults are limited. Although a retrospective study described the clinical characteristics of hospitalized adults with HPIV infections, the primary analysis did not focus on patients requiring admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). We investigated the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of a large cohort of critically ill adults in South Korea who had severe HPIV-associated pneumonia requiring ICU care during a 10-year period.

### Respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit [^1114HjWs]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory viruses cause a number of clinical syndromes in the intensive care unit, with different viruses being able to produce similar clinical pictures. Our main presenting problems are upper airway issues, such as croup and tracheitis; lower airway issues with intrapulmonary shunt, like bronchitis and pneumonia; lower airway issues with dynamic hyperinflation, such as bronchiolitis and wheeze; and control of breathing, exemplified by apnoea. This pragmatic classification is used because it enables focus on the physiological abnormality needing treatment, and on how best to deliver appropriate and adequate ventilator support. This review provides an overview of these syndromes and a more detailed account of respiratory syncytial virus, our most commonly diagnosed winter illness.

Children with a history of recurrent croup alert the ENT clinician to the potential for underlying laryngotracheal pathology. There is equipoise about the likelihood of identifying any underlying structural issues or subglottic stenosis in those children who undergo airway assessment.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary UK paediatric hospital, examining a decade of children with recurrent croup who underwent rigid laryngo-tracheo-bronchoscopy (airway endoscopy).

- **Main outcomes**: Airway pathology observed during endoscopy and the need for further airway surgery.

In ten years, 139 children underwent airway endoscopy for recurrent croup. Operative findings were abnormal in 62 (45%) cases. Twelve cases (9%) had subglottic stenosis. Although recurrent croup was more common in males (78% of cases), this was not found to predispose them to operative findings. Children with previous intubations had more than two times the risk of abnormal findings. Additionally, children born prematurely (< 37 weeks) showed a trend towards abnormal operative findings compared to children with no airway findings in our cohort. Even in those patients with abnormal findings, none necessitated further airway surgery.

Surgeons and parents can be reassured that rigid airway endoscopy for children with recurrent croup demonstrated high diagnostic utility but will rarely lead to further surgical intervention. Greater understanding about recurrent croup may require consensus clarification about definitions of recurrent croup and/or a universal adoption of a minimum standard operative record or grading system.

### A randomized trial of a single dose of oral dexamethasone for mild croup [^113GhhoP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). High credibility.

The benefits of dexamethasone treatment for moderate-to-severe croup are well established. However, most children with croup have mild symptoms, and it is unknown whether they would derive the same degree of benefit from dexamethasone treatment as children with more severe disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind trial at four pediatric emergency departments in which 720 children with mild croup were randomly assigned to receive one oral dose of either dexamethasone (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The children had mild croup, as defined by a score of ≤ 2 on the croup scoring system of Westley et al. The primary outcome was a return to a medical care provider for croup within seven days after treatment. The secondary outcome was the presence of ongoing symptoms of croup on days 1, 2, and 3 after treatment. Other outcomes included economic costs, hours of sleep lost by the child, and stress on the part of the parent in relation to the child's illness.

- **Results**: Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. Return to medical care was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (7.3 percent vs. 15.3 percent, P < 0.001). In the dexamethasone group, there was quicker resolution of croup symptoms (P = 0.003), less lost sleep (P < 0.001), and less stress on the part of the parent (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: For children with mild croup, dexamethasone is an effective treatment that results in consistent and small but important clinical and economic benefits. Although the long-term effects of this treatment are not known, our data

### Croup as a previously unrecognized symptom of COVID-19 in infants [^117QEmaG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Although the most common symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children are fever and cough, cases of croup associated with COVID-19 are reported in the literature and have increased sharply with the Omicron variant. We present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as a viral agent in an infant presenting with croup.

### The assessment and management of croup [^112vxggw]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of croup has changed considerably over the last 25 years with the liberalization of the use of systemic corticosteroids for mild to moderate cases. The administration of corticosteroids in croup has reduced the severity of the condition, dramatically reduced the need for endotracheal intubation, shortened the duration of intubation, reduced the length of hospital stay, and reduced the need for hospital admission. Additionally, it has reduced daycare and preschool absenteeism and improved sleep in milder cases. Despite studies demonstrating the efficacy of nebulized and intramuscular corticosteroids, the use of oral corticosteroids remains the recommended option in most, if not all, cases of croup presenting for medical assessment.

### Telephone out patient score: The derivation and validation of a telephone follow-up assessment tool for use in clinical research in children with croup [^111aoyJ8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

The objective was to derive a simple clinical scoring instrument for assessing children with croup by telephone for use in clinical research studies.

- **Methods**: We reviewed published literature on croup scores, surveyed experienced pediatric emergency nurses and physicians, and conducted a prospective cohort study. Score items were derived from published literature and surveys of experienced clinicians. We enrolled children with croup attending an urban pediatric emergency department. Families of children enrolled were contacted daily by telephone and asked standardized questions about their child's clinical symptoms and family functioning. Data from this survey were used to derive the clinical score.

- **Results**: We identified 11 unique croup scores from the literature and interviewed 6 experienced clinicians. We enrolled 330 children and achieved complete follow-up for 301. Of the various groupings of items and duration of assessment, the 2-item score (barky cough and stridor) was the simplest and most reliable. Three days of follow-up yielded optimal correlations.

- **Conclusions**: We derived a 2-item Telephone Out Patient score assessed daily for 3 days after an emergency department visit. Validation of this score in a future, independent prospective cohort is needed.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^114RCkWt]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with unique clinical presentations in children, including croup-like symptoms such as barking cough, hoarseness, and respiratory distress. This study aimed to compare the clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients with croup who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 during the Omicron wave.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 111 pediatric patients hospitalized with croup at Bahrami Children's Hospital and the Children's Medical Center in Iran from January 21 to March 20, 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: PCR-positive (Omicron group, n = 30) and PCR-negative (non-Omicron group, n = 81). Data on demographics, clinical severity, laboratory indices, treatments, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed using SPSS version 20.

- **Results**: The mean age of the Omicron group was significantly younger (16.93 ± 24.80 months) compared to the non-Omicron group (32.58 ± 37.26 months; p = 0.049). Symptom severity was higher in the Omicron group, with moderate to severe symptoms observed in 73.4% of patients, compared to 32.1% in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.001). The Omicron group had longer hospital stays (2.59 ± 3.93 vs. 2.11 ± 2.75 days; p = 0.016) and required more nebulized epinephrine (2.47 ± 1.27 vs. 1.77 ± 1.003 days; p = 0.003) and repeat corticosteroid doses (83.3% vs. 38.3%; p = 0.0001). Laboratory findings showed no significant differences between the groups (all p > 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Children with croup during the Omicron surge exhibited increased severity of symptoms and required more intensive treatment interventions.

### Successful treatment of parainfluenza virus respiratory tract infection with DAS181 in 4 immunocompromised children [^111kutum]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2015). Low credibility.

Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common respiratory pathogen typically associated with laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) in children, but it is also a frequent cause of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), pneumonia, and bronchiolitis. In immunocompromised hosts, such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy, progression from URTI to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is estimated at between 13% and 43%; mortality rates associated with LRTI are reported between 12% and 50%. Currently, there are no known antiviral medications with proven efficacy against PIV, nor are there preventive measures such as vaccines or prophylactic antibody therapies. Treatment remains primarily supportive in conjunction with reduction of immunosuppression.

DAS181, an investigational sialidase fusion protein, removes sialic acid-containing receptors from the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, thereby preventing PIV and influenza virus from binding to these cells. DAS181 has been shown to be safe in phase I and phase II clinical trials evaluating treatment of influenza. Additionally, DAS181 has documented both in vitro and in vivo activity against PIV. Several case reports in adults have described the use of DAS181 in HCT and lung transplant recipients with PIV LRTI. All adults had improvement in symptoms, oxygenation, and nasopharyngeal viral loads. In this report, we describe 4 severely immunocompromised pediatric patients with PIV infection treated with DAS181, with subsequent clinical and virologic improvement.

### Seasonality patterns in croup presentations to emergency departments in Alberta, Canada: a time series analysis [^114FTk24]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Croup is a common pediatric respiratory illness presenting to the emergency department (ED) in the fall and winter months. Most cases are caused by parainfluenza viruses. We examine the monthly patterns of young children who made croup-related visits to EDs in Alberta, Canada.

- **Methods**: Emergency department visits were identified in provincial administrative databases to obtain all ED encounters for croup made by young children (aged ≤ 2 years) during 6 years (April 1, 1999, to March 30, 2005). Time series models (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average) were developed to capture temporal and seasonal trends and predict future presentations.

- **Results**: Overall, 27,355 croup-related ED visits were made during the study period. More males (62%) than females presented, and most (43%) were younger than 1 year. Differences were observed in the number of visits made in odd and even years. Peak visits occurred in November for odd years and in February for other years. Strong seasonal patterns at 12 months were detected and included in the modeling.

- **Conclusions**: We observed the presence of a clear biennial pattern of croup ED visits. The seasonal autoregressive moving average models and predictions offer insights into the epidemiology of croup-related visits to EDs and may be helpful in planning both research and resource needs.

### Heliox for croup in children [^114tjPfu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Croup is an acute viral respiratory infection characterized by upper airway mucosal inflammation that may lead to respiratory distress. Most cases of croup are mild. However, moderate to severe cases may require treatment with corticosteroids, which often have delayed benefits, and nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline), which may provide short-lived relief and can cause dose-related adverse effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension. In rare instances, croup can result in respiratory failure, necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation.

A mixture of helium and oxygen, known as heliox, is used during the emergency transport of children with severe croup. Heliox may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates by reducing the viscosity of inhaled air. Anecdotal evidence suggests that heliox relieves respiratory distress. This review updates versions previously published in 2010 and 2013.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of heliox compared to oxygen or other active interventions, placebo, or no treatment, on relieving signs and symptoms in children with croup, as determined by a croup score and rates of admission and intubation.

- **Search methods**: We searched several databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS in January and February 2018. Additionally, we searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 8 February 2018. We also contacted the British Oxygen Company, a leading supplier of heliox.

### SHEA practice update: Infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^1168bjXz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

People can become ill with upper or lower tract respiratory infections. Upper tract respiratory infections include the common cold, sinusitis, and croup. Lower tract respiratory infections include pneumonia and bronchiolitis. These infections are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The risk of a person having a severe lower respiratory infection depends on age, underlying conditions, and the causative organism.

- **Upper respiratory infections**: The viruses adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and the coronaviruses most commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections.

- **Lower respiratory infections**: Viruses or bacteria can cause lower respiratory tract infections. In infants and severely immune-compromised individuals, these viruses can result in severe lower tract respiratory disease. Among severely immune-compromised individuals and those with underlying conditions (such as prematurity, chronic lung disease, and heart disease), RSV pneumonia carries high morbidity and mortality. In infants, RSV bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory diseases, and RSV can be associated with large outbreaks.

In children and adults, bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella, cause pneumonia.

Most respiratory viruses spread through respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing. For certain respiratory viruses, such as RSV, a person can also become ill from direct contact with infected respiratory secretions.

### Never trust a croup [^116vkHqb]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old girl presented to the James Paget University Hospitals Trust with croup-like symptoms and was later discharged with dexamethasone syrup. The patient re-presented 6 hours later following maternal concern, with signs of acute respiratory distress. After a period of clinical stability, she acutely decompensated without any prior signs of a life-threatening deterioration. She was managed using nebulised epinephrine and showed signs of clinical improvement. Although improvement persisted, the child showed signs of exhaustion following the preceding events and was later intubated with an endotracheal tube. She was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's University Hospital in Cambridge.

Endotracheal aspiration later grew parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was diagnosed with the exceptionally rare, life-threatening complication of croup: bacterial tracheitis. The patient was discharged from intensive care 7 days later and has since made a full recovery.

### Croup associated with SARS-CoV-2: Pediatric laryngotracheitis during the Omicron surge [^112hyrsW]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). High credibility.

During the 2-month Delta-dominant period, there were 44,940 total emergency department (ED) visits. Of those visits, 2,115 (4.7%) were associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Among these COVID-19 visits, 609 (28.8%) were for children aged 0–4 years, and 107 (17.6%) of those visits in the 0–4 year age group resulted in hospital admission. Additionally, 20 (0.9%) of the 2,115 COVID-19 visits included a diagnosis of croup.

In comparison, during the 3-week Omicron-dominant period, there were 15,423 total ED visits, with 1,851 (12%) associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of these COVID-19 visits, 951 (51.2%) involved children aged 0–4 years, marking a substantial 77.8% increase in the proportion of this age group compared to the Delta outbreak (P < 0.001). Among the 951 visits for COVID-19 in children aged 0–4 years, 155 (16.1%) were associated with hospital admission. Furthermore, 200 (10.8%) of the 1,851 COVID-19 visits included a diagnosis of croup, representing a 12-fold increase in the frequency of croup associated with COVID-19 (P < 0.001; see Figure 2).

### Croup and COVID-19 in a child: A case report and literature review [^115Wy9qR]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Croup (laryngotracheitis) is frequently encountered in the emergency department in young children presenting with stridor. We describe a rare case of croup secondary to SARS-CoV-2 in an 18-month-old child who presented with stridor and respiratory distress and required urgent intubation. Subsequently, the child developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

The child was monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit. We would like to highlight that COVID-19 croup in children may be an indicator for MIS-C, and close monitoring is warranted as MIS-C is a life-threatening condition. Our limited experience suggests that COVID-19 croup, especially if associated with MIS-C, has an underlying more severe pathology and may require prolonged treatment compared to typical croup or even COVID-19 croup. It is important to recognize this clinical entity during a time when most countries are in a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome presenting as mimicking croup [^115SawPV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Stridor is a commonly encountered presenting symptom of upper airway obstruction in the pediatric population. Although infectious etiologies such as croup, retropharyngeal abscess, and epiglottitis predominate in this demographic, other less common causes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis. We report a case of a 3-year-2-month-old girl who exhibited progressive hoarseness, barking cough, and dyspnea, with initial clinical symptoms mimicking those of croup. After admission, she developed progressive muscle weakness and areflexia. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis. She was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). We emphasize that the early recognition of atypical presentations of GBS warrants further evaluation and appropriate management.

- **Frequency of laryngotracheitis (croup)**: Figure 2 illustrates the frequency of laryngotracheitis among emergency department (ED) visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The study compares the Delta versus Omicron SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within a pediatric quaternary care system.

- **Clinical features**: To further characterize the clinical features of croup associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified 36 patients with croup who underwent testing by multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP). Of these patients, 24 (66.7%) were exclusively SARS-CoV-2-positive. The median age among these 24 patients was 12 months, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 5 to 21.5 months. There was a predominance of male patients, with 18 (75%) being male and 6 (25%) female.

- **Demographic details**: In terms of ethnicity, 10 (41.7%) were Caucasian, 7 (29.2%) were African American, 5 (20.8%) were Hispanic, and 2 (8.3%) were Asian.

- **Patient outcomes**: Thirteen (54.2%) of the patients were discharged home from the ED, while 11 (45.8%) were admitted to the hospital; out of these, 2 (18.2%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). One patient required supplemental oxygen with heliox. The median length of stay (LOS) for those admitted to the hospital was 24 hours (IQR, 24 to 36 hours). Patient management adhered to the standard clinical pathway for croup in our system, as outlined in the supplementary table and figure.

### Humidified air inhalation for treating croup [^1116k3cH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children, with a peak incidence of 60 per 1000 child years in those aged between one and two years. It is characterized by hoarseness, a barking cough, and inspiratory stridor. These symptoms are thought to occur as a result of edema of the larynx and trachea, which have been triggered by a recent viral infection. Parainfluenza virus type 1 is the agent most commonly identified in cases of croup. Severe cases are admitted to the hospital and steroid treatment is established to reduce disease severity. Treatment with humidified air was previously widely used and is still commonly recommended as home treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of humidified air in the treatment of croup.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), and EMBASE (1990 to January 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving children suffering from croup treated with humidified air.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently identified potentially relevant abstracts from the search and then assessed the full papers for inclusion and methodological quality. Outcome measures included mortality, ventilation, admission to the hospital, re-contact with medical services, number of days off school, and relief of symptoms; these were separately analyzed for the week following treatment. Data extraction was performed by the two authors and then entered by o

### Pediatric croup due to omicron infection is more severe than non-COVID croup [^112ig8U9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Croup due to infection with the omicron variant of COVID is an emerging clinical entity, but distinguishing features of omicron croup have not yet been characterized. A study was designed to compare the clinical features of croup patients presenting to the pediatric emergency department pre-COVID pandemic with COVID-positive croup patients who presented during the initial omicron surge.

This was a retrospective observational cohort study of children aged 0 to 18 years who presented to an urban, tertiary care pediatric emergency department with symptoms of croup. The study compared a cohort of croup patients who presented in the year before the onset of the COVID pandemic to a cohort of COVID-positive croup patients who presented during the initial omicron surge. The primary outcomes included illness severity and treatments required in the emergency department, while the secondary outcome was hospital admission rate.

There were 499 patients enrolled in the study: 88 in the omicron croup cohort and 411 in the classic croup cohort. Compared with the classic croup patients, omicron croup patients were more likely to present with stridor at rest (45.4% vs. 31.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.82; confidence interval, 1.14–2.91) and hypoxia (3.4% vs. 0.5%; OR, 7.22; CI, 1.19–43.86). Omicron croup patients required repeat dosing of inhaled epinephrine in the emergency department more often (20.4% vs. 6.8%; OR, 3.51; CI, 1.85–6.70) and were more likely to require respiratory support (9.1% vs. 1.0%; OR, 10.18; CI, 2.99–34.60). Admission rates were significantly higher.
