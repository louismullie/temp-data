## Question

poorly controlled asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing poorly controlled asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what constitutes "poorly controlled" asthma and distinguishing it from severe asthma. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including symptom control, future risk, and modifiable factors. Next, I will examine the differential diagnosis and common contributors to poor control. After that, I need to outline a stepwise management approach, including when to step up, when to refer, and how to monitor. Finally, I should consider special populations, implementation strategies, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislabel patients. Poorly controlled asthma reflects inadequate symptom control and/or elevated future risk despite appropriate therapy, whereas severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors; importantly, severity is a retrospective label based on the treatment required to achieve control, not a static trait at presentation [^741057e7] [^04102ddf] [^a2c5e253].

> I need to check the two-domain framework for control. Symptom control includes daytime symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, activity limitation, and reliever use, while future risk includes exacerbation history, lung function trajectory, and medication side effects; I should confirm that both domains are assessed at every visit because they can be discordant, with good symptom control masking high risk [^938265a3] [^7fd3a679] [^5dba8ae7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes before a structured assessment. I should verify modifiable contributors systematically: inhaler technique, adherence, persistent exposures such as smoking or occupational allergens, comorbidities like rhinitis, GERD, obesity, OSA, and psychosocial factors; these are common and correctable, and GINA explicitly recommends addressing them before escalating therapy [^a32b60c2] [^4679f0d0] [^5896c32a].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic foundation. If control remains poor despite seemingly appropriate therapy, I should confirm the diagnosis of asthma with objective variable airflow limitation and exclude mimics such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, cardiac disease, or COPD; misdiagnosis and alternative diagnoses are frequent in "difficult-to-treat" presentations, so I need to ensure the basics are right before labeling someone as severe [^5896c32a] [^3f70c465].

> Next, I should review the stepwise management approach and when to step up. Before escalating, I must confirm adherence and technique, address exposures, and treat comorbidities; if still uncontrolled on low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA, a sustained step-up for 2–3 months is reasonable, but I should treat it as a therapeutic trial and step back down if there is no response, aligning with GINA's personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment, and review [^a32b60c2] [^1df97e08] [^aa7bd711].

> I will now examine pharmacologic strategies for poorly controlled asthma. Let me consider SMART: budesonide-formoterol used as both maintenance and reliever reduces severe exacerbations compared with maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA in patients with uncontrolled asthma; I should confirm candidacy and counsel on correct use, and remember that SMART is endorsed in GINA Track 1 for adults and adolescents when available [^ce3b55e8] [^aa7bd711].

> But wait, what if SMART is not available or not preferred? I should double-check alternatives. Stepping up to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, adding LAMA, LTRA, or low-dose azithromycin in adults are evidence-informed options; for patients with Type 2 inflammation and persistent exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA, biologics targeting IgE, IL-5, IL-4/13, or TSLP are appropriate, and I need to ensure phenotype-guided selection and reassess response every 3–6 months [^dd0ddc93] [^f569d9e8] [^18673519].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of oral corticosteroids. Maintenance OCS is a last resort for severe asthma due to substantial cumulative toxicity; if used, it should be at the lowest effective dose with monitoring for adrenal suppression and other adverse effects, and I should prioritize minimizing OCS exposure through optimization of inhaled therapy and biologics whenever possible [^de54c155] [^00d962ae].

> I need to ensure I am not missing referral triggers. Patients with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite Step 4 therapy, or those requiring Step 5 treatment, should be referred for specialist assessment, phenotyping, and consideration of add-on therapies; earlier referral is warranted if the diagnosis is uncertain, occupational asthma is suspected, or the disease is severe or difficult to manage [^2ed56d7e] [^759d42f1].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and what to track. Let me verify that follow-up every 1–3 months after treatment changes and every 3–12 months thereafter is recommended, with earlier review after exacerbations; at each visit I should assess symptom control, exacerbations, lung function, inhaler technique, adherence, and patient goals, and I should document a written asthma action plan updated to the current control status [^a2ff5cae] [^749529cb] [^8ae64598].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with children. For children 5 years and younger, I should confirm the diagnosis when control is poor, verify technique and adherence, and consider alternative diagnoses or a trial of a different controller before stepping up; pediatric-specific yardsticks and GINA sections provide practical guidance for age-stratified care [^936948fc] [^3673010a].

> Let me consider patients with overlapping COPD features. I should confirm that ICS are essential and never use LABA or LAMA alone in patients with any asthma features; combination ICS-LABA is typically required, and LAMA may be added for symptom control, with careful attention to inhaler selection and technique [^043b1054].

> I should double-check implementation strategies because guidelines alone are insufficient. Embedding control-based care with standardized assessment, inhaler technique checks, adherence support, and written action plans improves outcomes; system-level interventions such as free ICS after hospitalization, education, and telehealth for high-risk patients can be impactful when adapted to local context [^9811d218] [^784506ca] [^66b4d55d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that better symptom control always equals better risk reduction; I need to correct that. Patients with good symptom control can still have severe exacerbations, so I must explicitly assess risk factors such as prior exacerbations, low FEV1, high SABA use, and eosinophilia, and tailor therapy accordingly rather than relying on symptoms alone [^5dba8ae7] [^a3eb2c16].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm the diagnosis and classify control using both symptom and risk domains; second, screen for and correct modifiable factors including technique, adherence, exposures, and comorbidities; third, optimize ICS-containing therapy and consider SMART where appropriate; fourth, if still uncontrolled after 2–3 months, step up thoughtfully as a therapeutic trial; fifth, refer for specialist assessment if Step 4 fails or Step 5 is needed; sixth, monitor closely and step down once control is sustained for 2–3 months, maintaining a written action plan throughout [^aa7bd711] [^a32b60c2] [^dfe83fda].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with the highest-quality sources. GINA 2024 provides the backbone for definitions, assessment, stepwise treatment, and referral, while the SMART meta-analysis and contemporary reviews reinforce the benefit of anti-inflammatory reliever strategies and the importance of addressing real-world barriers to control; integrating these elements yields a coherent, evidence-based plan for poorly controlled asthma [^092ecb1e] [^ce3b55e8] [^76691807].

Poorly controlled asthma is defined by **persistent symptoms, frequent exacerbations, or impaired lung function** despite appropriate therapy [^7fd3a679]. It is best understood as a **control-based problem** rather than a severity label, requiring assessment of both symptom control and future risk [^eb946f0d]. Common causes include **nonadherence, incorrect inhaler technique, modifiable risk factors, and comorbidities**; addressing these is essential before escalating therapy [^a32b60c2]. Management follows a **stepwise approach**, with ICS-containing regimens as foundation, optimization of technique and adherence, and escalation to ICS-LABA, SMART, or biologics for severe phenotypes [^aa7bd711] [^ce3b55e8] [^dd0ddc93]. Regular follow-up, written action plans, and patient education improve outcomes and reduce exacerbations [^d64c4ccd] [^749529cb].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Poorly controlled asthma is defined by **suboptimal control of symptoms and/or exacerbations** despite appropriate therapy [^7fd3a679]. GINA defines control across two domains: **symptom control** (frequency/severity of symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, activity limitation, reliever use) and **future risk** (exacerbations, lung function decline, medication side effects) [^938265a3]. Poor control includes frequent symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, activity limitation, frequent reliever use, and recurrent exacerbations or hospitalizations [^741057e7].

---

## Clinical manifestations and impact

Poorly controlled asthma presents with:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Cough, wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness [^aa46bd74].
- **Frequent exacerbations**: Need for oral corticosteroids, emergency care, or hospitalization [^741057e7].
- **Impaired lung function**: Reduced FEV1, increased airway hyperresponsiveness [^a3eb2c16].
- **Quality of life**: Sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, depression, activity limitation [^7ec64e6c].
- **Economic burden**: Higher healthcare utilization and costs [^20f4bc7b].

---

## Factors contributing to poor control

Several factors contribute to **poor control**:

| **Category** | **Factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Nonadherence <br/> - Incorrect inhaler technique <br/> - Poor self-management <br/> - Smoking <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Psychosocial issues [^a32b60c2] [^d5b44c01] |
| Disease-related | - Severe asthma phenotypes <br/> - Comorbidities (rhinitis, sinusitis, GERD, OSA, anxiety/depression) <br/> - Persistent allergen exposure [^5896c32a] [^4679f0d0] |
| Treatment-related | - Inadequate therapy <br/> - Suboptimal inhaler device <br/> - Lack of written action plan <br/> - Poor patient education [^ce948f7d] [^d64c4ccd] |

---

## Assessment and monitoring

Effective management requires **systematic assessment**:

- **Symptom control**: Use ACT, ACQ, or similar tools [^97f4f2b2].
- **Lung function**: Measure FEV1 at diagnosis, 3–6 months after treatment, then periodically [^938265a3].
- **Exacerbation history**: Document frequency, severity, and triggers [^a3eb2c16].
- **Inhaler technique and adherence**: Check at every visit [^a2ff5cae].
- **Comorbidities**: Screen for rhinitis, sinusitis, GERD, OSA, anxiety/depression [^8ae64598].

---

## Management strategies

Management follows a **stepwise approach**, with **personalized care**:

- **Confirm diagnosis and optimize basics**: Ensure correct diagnosis, inhaler technique, and adherence [^a32b60c2].
- **Step up therapy**: Escalate to ICS-LABA, SMART (ICS-formoterol), or add LAMA, LTRA, or biologics for severe phenotypes [^ce3b55e8] [^dd0ddc93].
- **Address modifiable factors**: Manage comorbidities, exposures, and lifestyle factors [^e6cd1f56].
- **Patient education and self-management**: Provide written action plans and train in self-monitoring [^d64c4ccd].
- **Regular follow-up**: Review control, risk, and treatment response every 3–6 months [^f9edbede].

---

## Role of biologic therapies

Biologics are indicated for severe asthma with Type 2 inflammation (eosinophilic, allergic) uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS-LABA. Options include **anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL5/5R (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab), anti-IL4/13 (dupilumab), and anti-TSLP (tezepelumab)** [^dd0ddc93]. These agents reduce exacerbations, improve lung function, and enable corticosteroid sparing, but require careful selection and monitoring [^dd0ddc93].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Poorly controlled asthma is associated with increased exacerbations, accelerated lung function decline, and reduced quality of life [^6be807f7]. Effective control improves symptoms, lung function, and quality of life and reduces healthcare utilization [^20f4bc7b]. Long-term risks include **persistent airflow limitation and corticosteroid-related adverse effects** [^7ec64e6c].

---

Poorly controlled asthma reflects suboptimal symptom control and/or exacerbation risk despite therapy. It is driven by multiple modifiable factors; **addressing these and applying guideline-based, stepwise care** — including education, adherence support, and appropriate escalation — achieves better control and outcomes [^7ec64e6c].

Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients (and families) manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear. The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for the patient with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on current guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience and are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

### Assessment of asthma control and its impact on optimal treatment strategy [^98cc263f]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining optimal asthma control is a major asthma management goal advocated by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Recent evidence suggests that while asthma control is clearly achievable in most asthmatics, not all asthmatics attain optimal asthma control. The difficulty is compounded further because patients, physicians and regulatory bodies have different perceptions of what is meant by asthma control. The challenge therefore remains as to how best to assess asthma control and define management strategies to ensure that this control is achieved and maintained. Despite the availability of several patient-based tools for assessing asthma control, these are mostly employed in a research setting or in selected specialist clinics. A symptom-based treatment approach also may have its limitations because patients can be poor judges of disease symptoms and severity and under-estimation may lead to inadequate treatment of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) when treatment is administered as on-demand reliever therapy, since the effect of treatment on these underlying features occurs over a longer time course. The clinical benefits of sustained maintenance treatment for at least 3 months has been documented in recent studies of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination, which have demonstrated correlations between reduction in airway inflammation/AHR and reduction in exacerbation rates. In view of the putative limitations of a purely symptom-based asthma management plan, we suggest that treatment should be focussed on management of all aspects of the disease rather than management of symptoms alone, with a practical approach being treatment for a minimum of 3 months with an optimal dose to ensure maximal effects are seen on asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function, and remodelling.

### Asthma: guidelines-based control and management [^7138b269]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines-based management of the patient with asthma allows maximal levels of function with few adverse effects. A flexible approach to therapy that emphasizes an ongoing partnership between the patient and physician allows optimal communication, facilitating treatment adherence and maximal levels of control. Through assessment of the patient's initial severity of disease and an evaluation of the patient's ongoing level of control, appropriate medical therapy can be initiated and level of therapy can be modified based on the patient's response. Patient education, environmental control strategies, and proper use of medications are vital in achieving maximal benefit in asthma management. Excellent asthma control is possible and should be a goal of both physicians and patients.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^092ecb1e]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — decision point: Is asthma still uncontrolled, despite optimized therapy? YES: if asthma is still uncontrolled, the diagnosis of severe asthma has been confirmed, and if not done by now, refer the patient to a specialist or severe asthma clinic if possible. NO: if asthma is now well controlled, consider stepping down treatment; start by decreasing/ceasing oral corticosteroids (OCS) first (if used), checking for adrenal insufficiency, then remove other add-on therapy, then decrease ICS dose, but do not stop ICS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7ec64e6c]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management — long-term goals: The goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient, encompassing long-term asthma symptom control that may include few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity, and long-term asthma risk minimization that may include no exacerbations, improved or stable personal best lung function, no requirement for maintenance systemic corticosteroids, and no medication side-effects. The patient's goals for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; ask the patient what they want from their asthma treatment, and when discussing the best possible asthma outcomes with a patient, consider their goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Assessing symptom control is NOT enough: the patient's risk factors, including history of exacerbations, should always also be assessed, and symptom control and risk may be discordant because patients with few or no symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^55ce005b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^3673010a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children (and families) track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the 3 age groups of childhood-adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old)-and what works for 1 age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma. Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on current guidance documents, but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^e2b98ac9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severity vs. control

Management guidelines for asthma, as with many other diseases, include treatment algorithms based on severity of disease, as defined by the clinical features before treatment or by the treatment given. Severity usually refers to the degree of underlying pathology. Deciding the severity of asthma is not always easy. When respiratory specialists were shown a number of case studies and asked to assign the severity of the asthma for each case, there was considerable disagreement. The inherent variability of asthma also presents problems for classification of severity. Severe asthma, defined as persisting symptoms despite high levels of treatment, is likely to have a number of underlying reasons, including psychological and adherence factors.

Although the factors indicating control may be the same as those indicating severity (e.g. persistent symptoms, impaired lung function, high bronchodilator use, oral steroid use, unscheduled consultations, hospitalisations, life-threatening attacks), there is a difference in the two concepts. Patients with severe asthma can be well-controlled, while those with mild underlying disease can show signs of poorly controlled disease. Changing the management plan to one based on control and the goals of patients may show improved outcomes compared to a plan based on severity.

Hospital-based studies have suggested that outcomes may be better with treatment algorithms based on parameters that are more closely linked to control than usual symptom-based management protocols. There is a reduction in exacerbation rate, although a higher inhaled corticosteroid load received, in patients given treatments that optimise reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity, rather than treatment on the basis of symptoms. Likewise, a treatment strategy based on normalisation of sputum eosinophil levels resulted in reduced exacerbations compared to standard management protocols, without increasing steroid exposure. A randomised controlled trial conducted in New Zealand used a management strategy incorporating exhaled nitric oxide (NO) readings and achieved control that was at least as good as that obtained with a guideline-based approach but using a lower inhaled steroid dosage. The GOAL study used a strategy based on the combined aims of treatment given in the GINA guidelines, and showed that the majority of patients treated with individually titrated doses of inhaled corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with long-acting beta 2 -agonist, could achieve and maintain control.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f9edbede]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Continue collaborative optimization of patient care — ongoing management of a patient with severe asthma involves collaboration among the patient, the primary care physician, specialist(s), and other health professionals to optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Continue to review the patient every 3–6 months, including clinical asthma measures (symptom control, exacerbations, lung function), comorbidities, the patient's risk factors for exacerbations, treatments (check inhaler technique and adherence, review need for add-on treatments, assess side-effects including of oral corticosteroids [OCS], and optimize comorbidity management and non-pharmacologic strategies), and the patient's social and emotional needs. The optimal frequency and location of review will depend on the patient's asthma control, risk factors and comorbidities, and their confidence in self-management, and may depend on local payer requirements and availability of specialist physicians. Communicate regularly with the family physician and other members of the health care team about the outcome of review visits, patient concerns, an action plan for worsening asthma or other risks, changes to medications (asthma and non-asthma) and potential side-effects, and indications and contact details for expedited review.

Assessment of asthma in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — The level of asthma control is the extent to which the features of asthma can be observed in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment, and asthma control is assessed in two domains: symptom control and risk of adverse outcomes; poor symptom control is burdensome to patients and increases the risk of exacerbations, but patients with good symptom control can still have severe exacerbations.

Asthma review frequency — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — states that each patient's asthma should be reviewed regularly to monitor control, risk factors and exacerbations and to document response to treatment changes; for most controller medications improvement begins within days but the full benefit may only be reached after 3–4 months; all healthcare providers should be encouraged to assess asthma control, adherence and inhaler technique at every visit; and ideally patients should be seen 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, with a review visit within 1 week scheduled after an exacerbation.

Overall assessment priorities in asthma — for every patient, assessment of asthma should include asthma control (both symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes), treatment issues (particularly inhaler technique and adherence), and any comorbidities that could contribute to symptom burden and poor quality of life; lung function, particularly FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value, is an important part of the assessment of future risk.

### Why arent't we doing better in asthma: time for personalised medicine? [^bc8c7b30]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

After decades of improvement, asthma outcomes have stalled. Mortality, hospitalisations, exacerbations and symptom control remain sub-optimal. In controlled trials, most patients gain high levels of control, but in 'real-life' routine clinical practice most patients do not. Avoidable factors are found in most asthma deaths and hospital admissions. This perspective paper considers and contextualises the factors underlying poor asthma outcomes, and it suggests approaches that could improve the situation. Factors discussed include severe, therapy-resistant disease and the role of new and upcoming pharmacological therapies in improving outcomes. These are likely to be beneficial when targeted on patients with severe disease and discrete phenotypic characteristics, identified through biomarkers. However, for the majority of patients treated in the community, they are unlikely to be used widely, and better use of current therapy classes will be more important. Non-adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment and over-use of rescue bronchodilators are common, and many patients have poor inhaler technique. Self-management is frequently poor, particularly in those with psychosocial disadvantages and co-morbidities. Communication between clinicians and patients is sometimes poor, with failure to detect avoidable poor control and non-adherence, and failure to provide the necessary information and education to support efficient self-management. Strategies for improving monitoring and clinician-patient interactions to allow personalised treatment are considered. These strategies have the potential to allow individual patient needs to be recognised and efficient targeting of the variety of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that we possess, which has the potential to improve both individual and population outcomes.

General Principles of Asthma Management

The goals of asthma management are to achieve good symptom control, relieve symptoms when they occur, and minimize the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related death, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. The patient's own treatment goals should be identified because they may be different. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, with shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management is not "one-size-fits-all" but instead should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review (Figure 2).

Personalized asthma management cycle of care. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 3–2).

Assessment

Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (also called "treatable traits") and patient/parent goals and preferences. Check adherence and inhaler technique frequently. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

Treatment Adjustment

Treatment adjustment includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (Section 3D in Reference) and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution (Box 3–9 in Reference).

For all patients, provide regular training in inhaler techniques and asthma self-management, including self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, and a written asthma action plan (Section 3C in Reference). Encourage adherence with controller medication, even when symptoms are infrequent. Consider stepping down treatment when good control has been maintained for 2–3 months (Box 3–7 in Reference).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^eb946f0d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Personalized control-based asthma management — Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction, and in control-based asthma management treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves assessment of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel to achieve the goals of asthma treatment; asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after the introduction of control-based guidelines or practical tools; since 2014, GINA has emphasized personalized management of modifiable risk factors and patient preferences while non‑modifiable risk factors such as a history of past ICU admission should also be documented; for many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations, and when ICSs were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function with decreases in exacerbations and asthma-related mortality; however, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations, some continue to exacerbate despite well-controlled symptoms, and side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses are stepped up, therefore both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk) should be considered when choosing treatment and reviewing response.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5975149a]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — biomarker-guided adjustment research needs and current practice emphasize that further studies are needed to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit and to define optimal monitoring frequency, including for corticosteroid de-escalation strategies, and that until more definitive evidence is available to support a specific strategy, GINA continues to recommend a comprehensive clinical evaluation that includes patient-reported symptoms as well as modifiable risk factors, environmental exposures comorbidities and patient preferences, when making treatment decisions for individual patients.

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^aa7bd711]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma — assessment and referral: Patients with poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA should be assessed for contributing factors and have asthma treatment optimized; if problems continue or diagnosis is uncertain, refer to a specialist center for phenotypic assessment and consideration of add-on therapy including biologics.

### Why arent't we doing better in asthma: time for personalised medicine? [^4e7de53f]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

After decades of improvement, asthma outcomes have stalled. Mortality, hospitalisations, exacerbations and symptom control remain sub-optimal. In controlled trials, most patients gain high levels of control, but in 'real-life' routine clinical practice most patients do not. Avoidable factors are found in most asthma deaths and hospital admissions. This perspective paper considers and contextualises the factors underlying poor asthma outcomes, and it suggests approaches that could improve the situation. Factors discussed include severe, therapy-resistant disease and the role of new and upcoming pharmacological therapies in improving outcomes. These are likely to be beneficial when targeted on patients with severe disease and discrete phenotypic characteristics, identified through biomarkers. However, for the majority of patients treated in the community, they are unlikely to be used widely, and better use of current therapy classes will be more important. Non-adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment and over-use of rescue bronchodilators are common, and many patients have poor inhaler technique. Self-management is frequently poor, particularly in those with psychosocial disadvantages and co-morbidities. Communication between clinicians and patients is sometimes poor, with failure to detect avoidable poor control and non-adherence, and failure to provide the necessary information and education to support efficient self-management. Strategies for improving monitoring and clinician–patient interactions to allow personalised treatment are considered. These strategies have the potential to allow individual patient needs to be recognised and efficient targeting of the variety of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that we possess, which has the potential to improve both individual and population outcomes.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^d58f591e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite access to diagnostic tests and effective therapies, asthma often remains misdiagnosed and/or poorly controlled or uncontrolled. In this review, we address the key issues of asthma diagnosis and management, recent evidence for levels of asthma control, the consequences of poor control and, in line with that, explore the potential reasons for poor asthma control and acute exacerbations. Based on recent evidence and current guidelines, we also aim to provide practical answers to the key questions of how to improve asthma management, with the best possible prevention of exacerbations, addressing the basics — adherence, inhaler misuse, obesity and smoking — and how to facilitate a new era of asthma care in the twenty-first century. We hope this review will be useful to busy primary care clinicians in their future interactions with their patients with both suspected and proven asthma.

Adapting and implementing asthma clinical practice guidelines — implementation of asthma management strategies may be carried out at a national, regional or local level, and ideally should be a multidisciplinary effort involving many stakeholders, using cost-effective methods of knowledge translation; each implementation initiative needs to consider the nature of the local health system and its resources, including human resources, infrastructure, and available treatments, with goals and strategies varying between and within countries based on economics, culture, and the physical and social environment; priority should be given to high-impact interventions, and specific steps need to be followed before clinical practice recommendations can be embedded into local clinical practice and become the standard of care, with the individual steps summarized in Box 14–2.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^020c4eb0]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

GINA levels of evidence — levels A–D are used to assign management recommendations and are defined by their sources and strength. Level A draws on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and observational evidence, with endpoints from well-designed RCTs or observational studies that provide a consistent pattern of findings, and Category A requires substantial numbers of studies and participants. Level B is based on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews but with a limited body of data, including intervention studies with limited numbers of patients or post hoc/subgroup analyses, and applies when few randomized trials exist, are small, involve different populations, or results are somewhat inconsistent. Level C is from non-randomized trials or observational studies. Level D reflects panel consensus judgment when clinical literature is insufficient for other categories and is based on clinical experience or knowledge.

### Getting control of uncontrolled asthma [^5901d52f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite various treatment modalities, a large proportion of patients have asthma that remains uncontrolled. These patients remain at an increased risk of developing severe exacerbations, have a poor quality of life, and pose a high economic healthcare burden, with an estimated mean annual cost more than double that of patients with good symptom control. It is therefore important to accurately diagnose asthma and continually assess asthma control. Several validated tools are available to do this, including questionnaires, biomarker analysis, and bronchoscopy. Current guidelines advise physicians to establish a self-management program for the patient to assess and monitor asthma control. A further recommendation is the establishment of an educational action plan to increase treatment adherence and to improve asthma control. National and international guidelines provide long-term management strategies for these patients and recommend a stepwise approach for achieving and maintaining asthma control. Despite availability of a wide range of controller and reliever therapies, uncontrolled asthma remains a challenge and reflects the need for new therapeutic options. This review discusses current global guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma control and summarizes the broad spectrum of novel therapeutic agents currently under development for the treatment of asthma, including anticholinergics, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecules expressed on T-helper 2 lymphocyte antagonists, and anti-interleukin (IL)-5, anti-IL-13, and anti-IL-4 agents.

Adjusting ongoing asthma treatment in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6–11 years — once asthma treatment has begun, ongoing treatment decisions are based on a personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment, and review of the response, and for each patient asthma medication can be adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and medication side-effects; when good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, treatment may be stepped down to find the patient's minimum effective treatment. People's ethnic and racial backgrounds may be associated with different responses to treatment and these are not necessarily associated with genetic differences. If a patient has persisting uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite 2–3 months of ICS-containing treatment, assess and correct the following common problems before considering any step up in treatment: incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, persistent exposure at home/work to agents such as allergens, tobacco smoke, indoor or outdoor air pollution, or to medications such as beta-blockers or (in some patients) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), comorbidities that may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life, and incorrect diagnosis.

### Identification and management of adults with asthma prone to exacerbations: can we do better? [^6be807f7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A major goal of international guidelines on the management of asthma is to achieve control of current symptoms, lung function and reliever inhaler use and to prevent future risks of exacerbations and decline in lung function. Despite the widespread dissemination of asthma guidelines many patients have inadequately controlled disease and experience frequent exacerbations of asthma. Exacerbations are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, generate high health costs and are the main cause of mortality in asthma. The identification and appropriate management of adults with asthma who are prone to exacerbations is of considerable importance as by this means it should be possible to reduce the large number of patients who currently experience uncontrolled disease.

Asthma control — defined as the extent to which the manifestations of asthma can be observed in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment — has two domains (symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes) and both should always be assessed; lung function, particularly FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value, is an important part of the assessment of future risk, and it should be measured at the start of treatment, after 3–6 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter, and it should be recorded at diagnosis, 3–6 months after starting treatment, and periodically thereafter.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^741057e7]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Definitions — uncontrolled, difficult-to-treat, and severe asthma: Uncontrolled asthma includes one or both of poor symptom control and frequent exacerbations, specifically frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year) requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), or serious exacerbations (≥ 1/year) requiring hospitalization. Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a second controller (usually a long-acting beta agonist [LABA]) or with maintenance OCS, or that requires high-dose treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations; in many cases it may reflect modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, smoking, comorbidities, or an incorrect diagnosis. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with maximal optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased, and asthma is not classified as severe if it markedly improves when contributory factors such as inhaler technique and adherence are addressed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f03c98ad]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### A review of the burden and management of mild asthma in adults-implications for clinical practice [^af643f8b]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild asthma is present in 50–75% of patients with asthma and is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as asthma that can be well controlled with low-intensity treatments (Steps 1 and 2). Despite this definition, 'mild' asthma is often not well controlled in reality, and can have a significant impact on an individual's symptom burden and quality of life. We performed a PubMed literature search to investigate the burden of 'mild' asthma in the lives of patients, including future risk and asthma control, and the current management strategies. While clinical guidelines recommend long-term, daily, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 'mild' asthma, published data suggest that ICS are often under-prescribed or used intermittently as symptoms arise. Furthermore, patients and physicians tend to overestimate disease control, impacting the accuracy of diagnosing 'mild asthma' and subsequent management. This disconnect may be amplified by miscommunication between patients and physicians, limited objective assessment of control, and differences in guidelines. As with moderate and severe asthma, current evidence supports early initiation of regular ICS in 'mild' asthma to address the underlying inflammation, achieve symptom control and reduce risk of exacerbations. Adherence to ICS treatment is key and can be improved by educating both patients and healthcare professionals. The results of this literature search challenge the term 'mild' asthma and suggest strategies to improve the proactive management of the disease to enable patients to live symptom-free.

### Improving adherence to asthma therapies [^1ed185c5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adherence to asthma therapies is poor leading to unnecessary morbidity and increased use of emergency and hospital resources. Strategies to improve adherence have not been successful.

Recent Findings

Asthma adherence disease management is a clinical method to improve adherence for asthma patients. The method includes: diagnosing adherence status; identifying patient barriers leading to nonadherence; selecting specific strategies for the clinician for each barrier identified; use of patient-centered communication skills to enhance the effectiveness of the strategies employed. This approach is now being tested in multiple controlled trials.

Summary

Clinicians may want to consider these strategies, in whole or in part, to improve asthma patient adherence.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^38cfaf49]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of modifiable risk factors, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to address potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce exacerbations exacerbations and minimize oral corticosteroid use in patients with asthma:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Any patient with ≥ 1 risk factors for exacerbations, including poor symptom control|- Ensure an ICS-containing treatment is prescribed < br > -; switch to a regimen with an anti-inflammatory reliever with ICS-formoterol or ICS-formoterol-short-acting β-agonist, if available, to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β-agonist reliever < br > -; provide a written action plan appropriate for the patient's health literacy < br > -; obtain more frequent monitoring than in low-risk patients < br > -; check inhaler technique and adherence frequently, correct as needed < br > -; identify and manage any modifiable risk factors|
| ≥ 1 severe exacerbation in last year|- Switch to a regimen with an anti-inflammatory reliever with as-needed ICS-formoterol or ICS-short-acting β-agonist, if available, to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β-agonist reliever < br > -, and refer for specialist opinion and consideration of biologic therapy. < br > -; identify and manage any avoidable triggers for exacerbations|
|Exposure to tobacco smoke or e-cigarettes|- Encourage smoking cessation by patient/family < br > -; provide counseling and resources < br > -; consider offering higher-dose of ICSs if asthma is poorly controlled|
|Low FEV1, especially if < 60% of predicted|- Address problems with adherence and inhaler technique < br > -; consider offering a trial of high-dose ICSs for 3 months < br > -; exclude other lung diseases, such as COPD < br > -; refer for expert advice if there is no improvement|
|Obesity|- Offer weight reduction strategies < br > -; distinguish asthma symptoms from symptoms due to deconditioning, mechanical restriction, and/or sleep apnea|
|Major psychological problems|- Refer for mental health assessment < br > - Help the patient to distinguish between symptoms of anxiety and asthma < br > - Counsel about the management of panic attacks|
|Major socioeconomic problems|- Identify the most cost-effective ICS-based regimen < br > -; optimize inhaler technique to maximize benefit from available medications|
|Confirmed food allergy|- Advise appropriate food avoidance < br > - Provide anaphylaxis action plan < br > - Prescribe injectable epinephrine < br > - Refer for expert advice|
|Occupational or domestic exposure to irritants|- Remove the patient from exposure as soon as possible < br > -; refer for expert advice as soon as possible|
|Allergen exposure if sensitized|- Advise a trial of simple avoidance strategies, taking the cost into account < br > -; consider stepping up asthma treatment if exposure is unavoidable < br > -; consider adding subcutaneous immunotherapy in symptomatic house dust mite-sensitive adult and adolescent patients with partially-controlled asthma despite ICSs, provided FEV1 is > 70% of predicted|
|High fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide in patients taking medium- or high-dose ICS|- Check and improve adherence|
|Sputum eosinophilia despite medium-/high-dose ICSs|- Consider increasing ICS dose independent of the level of symptom control|

### Achieving asthma control in practice: understanding the reasons for poor control [^8fafed9e]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Achieving asthma control remains an elusive goal for the majority of patients worldwide. Ensuring a correct diagnosis of asthma is the first step in assessing poor symptom control; this requires returning to the basics of history taking and physical examination, in conjunction with lung function measurement when appropriate. A number of factors may contribute to sub-optimal asthma control. Concomitant rhinitis, a common co-pathology and contributor to poor control, can often be identified by asking a simple question. Smoking too has been identified as a cause of poor asthma control. Practical barriers such as poor inhaler technique must be addressed. An appreciation of patients' views and concerns about maintenance asthma therapy can help guide discussion to address perceptual barriers to taking maintenance therapy (doubts about personal necessity and concerns about potential adverse effects). Further study into, and a greater consideration of, factors and patient characteristics that could predict individual responses to asthma therapies are needed. Finally, more clinical trials that enrol patient populations reflecting the real world diversity of patients seen in clinical practice, including wide age ranges, presence of comorbidities, current smoking, and differing ethnic origins, will contribute to better individual patient management.

Which patients should be referred to asthma specialists?

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma should be systematically assessed to find out if they have a severe asthma or other reasons explaining their poor response to treatment, such as poor adherence or inappropriate treatment. For patients who do not respond to standard step care management and have poor asthma control despite good adherence and inhalation technique, including management of environmental exposures and co-morbidities, referral to a specialist is clearly essential.

### Does self-management prevent severe exacerbations? [^d64c4ccd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite effective therapies, asthma outcomes remain suboptimal. Education in self-management is crucial to maintaining control in a variable condition such as asthma and reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations and deaths. This review considers the evidence for supported self-management.

Recent Findings

Recent systematic reviews have clarified and confirmed the major benefits from effective self-management education, but have also shown that implementation is rare in routine practice, with consequent avoidable morbidity and mortality. Recent research has focused on the most effective ways of delivering and supporting self-management in different patient groups and has clarified the relative effectiveness of the different components. Self-management support using new digital technologies has been investigated.

Summary

All clinicians treating patients with asthma should be supporting their patients to understand and manage their own condition. Optimal self-management incorporates education, provision of a personalized asthma action plan and is supported by regular professional review. Action plans in a written or digital format should advise on recognizing deterioration and the actions to take, including when to seek professional help, appropriate changes in medication dose or commencing rescue oral steroids. Action plans should be personalized and agreed by the patient, and provided in a culturally tailored form.

Asthma terminology and reporting — The page advises to explain that 'asthma control' tools such as ACQ and ACT assess only one domain of asthma control, and only over a short period of time, and to "Always emphasize the need for and benefit from ICS-containing treatment in patients with asthma, regardless of their symptom frequency or severity, and even if they have no obvious additional risk factors". For epidemiologic studies, it directs to "describe the prescribed (or dispensed) treatment, without imputing severity" and to "state the actual treatment class, rather than a treatment Step". For clinical trials, it instructs: "Describe the patient population by their level of asthma control and treatment, e.g., 'patients with uncontrolled asthma despite medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA' rather than 'moderate asthma'". It also notes that, pending ongoing discussions, "no change has been made to use of the term 'mild asthma' elsewhere in this GINA Strategy Report".

Stepping down treatment when asthma is well controlled — once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months and lung function has reached a plateau, treatment can often be successfully reduced without loss of asthma control; aims are to find the patient's minimum effective treatment to maintain good control of symptoms and exacerbations and to minimize costs and potential for side-effects, and to encourage continued ICS-containing treatment, noting that patients on maintenance controller treatment often experiment with intermittent treatment and that for patients prescribed GINA Track 1 MART the ICS-formoterol reliever provides a safety net during planned step-down or if adherence with maintenance doses is poor.

### "As-needed" inhaled corticosteroids for patients with asthma [^7a5d77db]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention of severe asthma exacerbations is a primary management goal for asthma across the severity spectrum. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations, but patient adherence to ICS-containing medications as a daily maintenance therapy is poor, and many patients overuse short-acting beta 2 -agonist relievers; both are associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations and death. Airway inflammation also varies over time, influenced by exposures such as viral infections and allergen. As-needed ICS strategies, in which patients receive ICSs (or additional ICSs, if already taking controller therapy) whenever they take their reliever inhaler, empower patients to adjust their ICS intake in response to symptom fluctuation. These strategies can improve asthma morbidity outcomes, particularly by reducing severe exacerbations and reducing the risk of adverse effects of oral corticosteroids. In this review, the evidence for combination ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler, ICS and short-acting beta 2 -agonists in separate inhalers, and combination ICS-albuterol in a single inhaler is presented, along with practical considerations, evidence gaps, and implications for clinical practice for each strategy, presented by level of asthma severity and age group. Improving access to such strategies on a global scale is imperative to improve asthma outcomes and achieve equity across populations.

Implementation of Asthma Management Strategies into Health Systems

To improve asthma care and patient outcomes, evidence-based recommendations must be disseminated and implemented nationally and locally and integrated into health systems and clinical practice. Implementation requires an evidence-based strategy involving professional groups and stakeholders and considering local cultural and socioeconomic conditions. The cost-effectiveness of implementation programs should be assessed so a decision can be made to pursue or modify them. Local adaptation and implementation of asthma care strategies are aided by purpose-developed tools.

### Wrong inhalation technique is associated to poor asthma clinical outcomes. is there room for improvement? [^6e396c59]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The long-term goals of asthma management are to control symptoms and to reduce the risk of exacerbations. Inhaled medication is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for asthma; therefore, good inhalation technique is the key for asthma management. However, up to 70% of asthma patients do not use their inhalers correctly. There is evidence on how poor inhalation technique is associated to poor asthma control. The purpose of this review is to present the most recent research in this field to help clinicians understand the importance of proper inhalers use and the possible interventions to optimize patients' inhalation technique.

Recent Findings

New evidence on how poor inhaler technique and specific critical errors are significantly associated to poor asthma control and exacerbations and how this negative impact could be improved by optimizing device selection, enhancing shared decision-making and giving more importance to education, both for patients and healthcare professionals. New devices and additional tools might help patients to achieve the correct inhaler technique and could form the basis of simplified educational interventions.

Summary

There is an urgent need for specific interventions including new educational strategies to minimize the negative effects of wrong inhalation technique in asthma clinical outcomes.

### The projected economic and health burden of uncontrolled asthma in the United States [^20f4bc7b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a very common chronic disease globally. The prevalence of asthma has increased over the last decade in many regions of the world. Despite the fact that asthma imposes a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems, it has not yet been identified as a healthcare priority in many countries. In the United States, there are approximately 26 million patients with physician-diagnosed asthma. Asthma cost the U.S. economy an estimated $81.9 billion in 2013 alone.

Conventional wisdom suggests that asthma is not a curable disease. Indeed, evidence indicates that airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation persist in individuals whose asthma has been dormant for many years. Therefore, the contemporary asthma management paradigm is based on achieving symptom control and reducing the risk of exacerbations. It is widely accepted that through avoidance of triggers and use of inhaled antiinflammatory agents (namely inhaled corticosteroids), asthma can be controlled and exacerbation risk can be significantly reduced in the majority of patients. Achieving asthma control is associated with improvement in quality of life, reduction in medical costs, and better work performance. Unfortunately, the reality of asthma care is highlighted by poor adherence to treatments and other disease management modalities (e.g. avoidance of triggers), resulting in a significant proportion of patients with asthma experiencing suboptimal asthma control.

A good understanding of the future burden of diseases can support the search for efficiency and equity in health care. Many studies have estimated the total burden of asthma in the United States. However, given the focus of contemporary asthma management is on achieving asthma control, the relevant figure of merit for policymaking and prioritizing future research is the added burden due to uncontrolled (vs. controlled) asthma, rather than the burden of asthma itself. In a small minority of patients, achieving symptom control can be difficult or out of reach. However, given the availability and efficacy of inexpensive management strategies to control asthma in the majority of patients, the excess burden between uncontrolled and controlled asthma is largely "preventable". Such burden can be considered as the maximum space available for contemporary asthma management strategies to reduce asthma burden at the population level. The resources required for interventions and programs aimed at improving asthma control can be juxtaposed against their estimated impact on the burden of suboptimal asthma control to evaluate whether such programs are worth implementing.

Risk factors for exacerbations — poor asthma symptom control itself substantially increases the risk of exacerbations, and additional independent risk factors include a history of ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, chronic sinusitis and smoking; the risk of severe exacerbations and mortality increases incrementally with higher SABA use, independent of treatment step, and prescribing of three or more 200-dose SABA inhalers in a year, corresponding to more than daily use, is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, increased mortality; risk factors and comorbidities that are modifiable are sometimes called 'treatable traits'.

### Management and referral of patients with severe and poorly controlled asthma in primary care [^ccfec024]. Family Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Over 50% of treated patients with asthma in Europe are not well controlled. Their management in primary health care (PHC) differs from that in specialized care, and there is no real coordination between the two.

Objectives

To identify barriers and solutions to improving the management of patients with severe and poorly controlled asthma and the communication between specialists and PHC, and to reach a consensus on the criteria for referral patients.

Methods

An observational study using a modified Delphi technique. About 79 physicians from PHC, pneumology and allergy fields from different Spanish regions were invited to participate via an online questionnaire. Consensus was reached on an item when more than two-thirds of the panel members scored within the 3-point category (1–3 or 7–9) containing the median and the interquartile range of answers had to be ≤ 4 points.

Results

Response rate: 52%. After the second round, consensus items were 40 (62.5%): of which 37 in agreement and 3 in disagreement. Around 92.68% of respondents agreed that it would be useful to incorporate questionnaires for asthma control into PHC computer-based searches. About 100% of participants agreed that clear consensus criteria between PHC and specialists must be determined to decide when a patient with asthma is referred from PHC to specialist or vice versa. Ten of the proposed criteria reached consensus agreement.

Conclusion

The failure to use guidelines and specific questionnaires for asthma control in PHC is one reason why there is underdiagnosis and poor control of asthma. Some strategies to improve the asthma care management emerged from the survey results.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

Sustained step-up for at least 2–3 months — some patients uncontrolled on low-dose ICS-LABA despite good adherence and correct technique may benefit from increasing the maintenance dose to medium; a step-up in treatment may be recommended after confirming symptoms are due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors have been addressed; any step-up should be regarded as a therapeutic trial, and if there is no response after 2–3 months, treatment should be reduced to the previous level with alternative treatments or referral considered.

Choice of medication, device and dose: In clinical practice, the choice of medication, device and dose for maintenance and for reliever for each individual patient should be based on assessment of symptom control, risk factors, which inhalers are available for the relevant medication class, whether these patient can use correctly after training, their cost, their environmental impact and the patient's likely adherence. It is important to monitor the response to treatment and any side-effects, and to adjust the dose accordingly, and the patient's response should be reviewed, and treatment stepped down once good control is achieved. There is currently insufficient good-quality evidence to support use of extrafine-particle ICS aerosols over others.

Box 3–5 — treating potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce exacerbations and minimize OCS use — For any patient with one or more risk factors for exacerbations (including poor symptom control), ensure an ICS-containing treatment (evidence A), consider switching to an anti-inflammatory reliever regimen (ICS-formoterol or ICS-SABA) if available, as this reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with if the reliever is SABA (evidence A), provide a written action plan appropriate for health literacy (evidence A), review more frequently than low-risk patients (evidence A), check inhaler technique and adherence frequently and correct as needed (evidence A), and identify and manage any modifiable risk factors (evidence D). For patients with ≥ 1 severe exacerbation in last year, switch to a regimen with an anti-inflammatory reliever (as-needed ICS-formoterol or ICS-SABA) if available, as this reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with if the reliever is SABA (evidence A), consider stepping up treatment if no modifiable risk factors (evidence A), and identify any avoidable triggers for exacerbations (evidence C). For exposure to tobacco smoke or e-cigarettes, encourage smoking cessation by patient/family with advice and resources (evidence A) and consider higher dose of ICS if asthma poorly controlled (evidence B).

### Asthma [^76691807]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide and is characterised by variable airflow obstruction, causing dyspnoea and wheezing. Highly effective therapies are available; asthma morbidity and mortality have vastly improved in the past 15 years, and most patients can attain good asthma control. However, undertreatment is still common, and improving patient and health-care provider understanding of when and how to adjust treatment is crucial. Asthma management consists of a cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk factors and adjustment of medications accordingly. With the introduction of biological therapies, management of severe asthma has entered the precision medicine era-a shift that is driving clinical ambitions towards disease remission. Patients with severe asthma often have co-existing conditions contributing to their symptoms, mandating a multidimensional management approach. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma; epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in children and adults.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^dd0ddc93]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### A woman with asthma: a whole systems approach to supporting self-management [^4bd4bbf3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although self-management plans have been shown to be successful for reducing the impact of asthma, the complexity of managing such a fluctuating disease on a day-to-day basis is challenging. During an asthma review, there is an opportunity to work with the patient to try to identify what triggers their symptoms and any actions that may help improve or maintain control. An integral part of personalised self-management education is the written PAAP, which gives the patient the knowledge to respond to the changes in symptoms and ensures they maintain control of their asthma within predetermined parameters. The PAAP should include details on how to monitor asthma, recognise symptoms, how to alter medication and what to do if the symptoms do not improve. The plan should include details on the treatment to be taken when asthma is well controlled, and how to adjust it when the symptoms are mild, moderate or severe. These action plans need to be developed between the doctor, nurse or asthma educator and the patient during the review and should be frequently reviewed and updated in partnership (see Box 1). Patient preference as well as clinical features such as whether she under- or over-perceives her symptoms should be taken into account when deciding whether the action plan is peak flow or symptom-driven. Our patient has a lot to gain from having an action plan. She has poorly controlled asthma and her lifestyle means that she will probably see different doctors (depending who is available) when she needs help. Being empowered to self-manage could make a big difference to her asthma control and the impact it has on her life.

The practice should have protocols in place, underpinned by specific training to support asthma self-management. As well as ensuring that healthcare professionals have appropriate skills, this should include training for reception staff so that they know what action to take if a patient telephones to say they are having an asthma attack.

However, focusing solely on symptom management strategies (actions) to follow in the presence of deteriorating symptoms fails to incorporate the patients' wider views of asthma, its management within the context of her/his life, and their personal asthma management strategies. This may result in a failure to use plans to maximise their health potential. A self-management strategy leading to improved outcomes requires a high level of patient self-efficacy, a meaningful partnership between the patient and the supporting health professional, and a focused self-management discussion.

Box 2–4 — Investigating poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite treatment — advises to watch patient use their inhaler(s) and check against an inhaler checklist, and to 'Show correct method, and recheck, up to 3 times. Re-check each visit'. It recommends empathetic adherence discussions including, 'In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you taken it?', and to confirm the diagnosis of asthma; if there is no evidence of variable airflow limitation, 'consider halving ICS dose and repeating lung function after 2–3 weeks' and 'Consider referring for challenge test'. For modifiable contributors, 'For adults/adolescents, switch to GINA Track 1, if available, to reduce exacerbations and simplify regimen', 'Check for risk factors or inducers such as smoking, beta-blockers or NSAIDs, or occupational or domestic allergen exposure… and address as possible', and 'Check for and manage comorbidities (e.g. rhinitis, obesity, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety)'. For therapy, 'Consider short-term (3–6 months) step-up to next treatment level or alternative option on present level', using shared decision-making. For persistent uncontrolled disease, 'If asthma still uncontrolled after 3–6 months on high dose ICS-LABA, or with ongoing risk factors, refer for expert advice', and 'Refer earlier than 6 months if asthma very severe or difficult to manage, or if doubts about diagnosis, or if occupational asthma is suspected'.

### Targeting asthma remission as the next therapeutic step toward improving disease control [^859a1880]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, comprising the assessment of 2 main domains: (1) symptom control and (2) future risk of adverse outcomes. Decades of progress in asthma management have correlated with increasingly ambitious disease control targets. Moreover, the introduction of precision medicines, such as biologics, has further expanded the limits of what can be achieved in terms of disease control. It is now believed that clinical remission, a term rarely associated with asthma, may be an achievable treatment goal. An expert framework published in 2020 took the first step toward developing a commonly accepted definition of clinical remission in asthma. However, there remains a widespread discussion about the clinical parameters and thresholds that should be included in a standardized definition of clinical remission. This review aims to discuss on-treatment clinical remission as an aspirational outcome in asthma management, drawing on experiences from other chronic diseases where remission has long been a goal. We also highlight the integral role of shared decision-making between patients and health care professionals and the need for a common understanding of the individual patient journey to remission as foundational elements in reducing disease burden and improving outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Management of severe asthma before referral to the severe asthma specialist [^3f70c465]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and can be challenging to assess and control, due to heterogeneity of disease, complexity of diagnosis, and impact of comorbidities. A structured approach to the assessment and management of severe asthma may be helpful to the practicing clinician. First, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. In patients who are either not responding to treatment, or who require high doses of medication to control symptoms, it is highly possible that disease mimickers or comorbidities are present and can inhibit therapeutic responsiveness. The assessment and management of common comorbidities of asthma may dramatically impact disease control and thus medication requirement. Determining medication adherence and optimizing drug dose and delivery may separate out truly severe asthmatics from those not using medications regularly or properly. Next, although true personalized medicine for severe asthma is not yet realized, for those individuals with severe asthma, phenotypic characteristics of each patient may guide which therapeutic options may be most effective for that patient. Finally, evaluation and management of severe asthma at a referral center can add additional phenotyping, therapeutic, and diagnostic strategies.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^39ea7a19]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^a2c5e253]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — retrospective treatment-based definitions — state that moderate asthma is well controlled with Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, e.g., with low- or medium-dose ICS LABA in either treatment track, and mild asthma is well controlled with low-intensity treatment, i.e., as needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, or low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA. The utility of this retrospective definition is limited because it cannot be assessed unless good asthma control has been achieved and treatment stepped down to find the patient's minimum effective dose, or unless asthma remains uncontrolled despite at least several months of optimized maximal therapy.

GINA assessment of asthma control — risk factor assessment for poor asthma outcomes includes: assess risk factors at diagnosis and periodically, particularly for patients experiencing exacerbations, and measure forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at start of treatment, after 3–6 months of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment to record the patient's personal best lung function, then periodically. Risk factors for exacerbations include high SABA use (≥ 3 x 200-dose canisters/year; increased mortality particularly if ≥ 1 canister per month), low FEV1 (especially < 60% predicted), and ≥ 1 severe exacerbation in last year.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^89f6d9b0]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a 'normal' way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social and economic burdens of asthma. Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication and good doctor patient partnerships. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control, which in turn reduces the need for emergency visits to the hospital or clinic and reduces the limitations on physical activity previously imposed by the condition.

### Defining and managing risk in asthma [^2e4d90c5]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma attacks are a major global source of morbidity and cost. The incidence and impact of asthma attacks have not improved despite widespread adoption of effective universal treatment guidelines. Consequently, there is increasing interest in managing asthma based on specific assessments of both current symptoms and future risk. In this review, we consider 'risk' in asthma, and how it might be assessed from the patient's history and objective measurements. We also discuss the potential for encouraging shared decision-making and improving medical consensus through explicit communication of risk and highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in risk assessment to improve asthma management through individualised treatment strategies.

Implementing asthma management strategies — methodology and adaptation note that when asthma care is consistent with evidence-based recommendations, outcomes improve; rigorous methodologies such as GRADE for developing recommendations and ADAPTE for adapting them have assisted in reducing biased opinion in asthma programs; adaptation of recommendations to local conditions using the GRADE method is costly and often requires expertise not available locally, with regular revision required; the GINA annual report is not a formal guideline but an evidence-based strategy, updated yearly from a review of the evidence published in the last 18 months; and, as with other evidence-based clinical recommendations, the GINA strategy must be adapted to the local context for implementation in clinical practice.

Asthma treatment step-down — pre-step-down assessment should account for current treatment, risk factors and preferences, with few data on optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of reductions. Factors associated with greater risk after step-down include a history of exacerbations and/or emergency department visit for asthma in the previous 12 months, and a low baseline FEV1; other predictors include airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophilia, but these tests are not readily available in primary care. Any treatment step-down should be considered as a therapeutic trial, evaluating symptom control and exacerbation frequency, and before stepping down, the patient should be given a written asthma action plan and instructions for how and when to re-start their previous treatment if their symptoms worsen.

How to assess a patient's asthma — Assess symptom control from the frequency of daytime and night-time asthma symptoms, night waking and activity limitation and, for patients using short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) reliever, their frequency of SABA use; other tools for recent symptom control include Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), but there are no validated tools for assessing symptom control over a longer period. Also, separately, assess the patient's risk factors for exacerbations even if symptom control is good; independent risk factors include a history of ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year, SABA-only treatment (without any inhaled corticosteroids [ICS]), over-use of SABA, socioeconomic problems, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), exposures such as smoking, and blood eosinophilia, and to date there are no suitable composite tools for assessing exacerbation risk. Also assess risk factors for persistent airflow limitation and medication side-effects (including from oral corticosteroids), treatment issues such as inhaler technique and adherence, and comorbidities.

How to distinguish between uncontrolled asthma and severe asthma — The page states, "Although good symptom control and minimal exacerbations can usually be achieved with ICS-containing treatment, some patients will not achieve one or both of these goals even with a long period of high-dose therapy", and notes that in many others, lack of control is due to "incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, over-use of SABA, comorbidities, persistent environmental exposures, or psychosocial factors". It emphasizes that "It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma", outlines initial steps in primary care and further management including referral and add-on treatment, and lists problems to exclude before diagnosing severe asthma: "Poor inhaler technique (up to 80% of community patients)"; "Poor medication adherence"; "Incorrect diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms due to alternative conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, cardiac failure or lack of fitness"; "Multimorbidity such as rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea"; and "Ongoing exposure to sensitizing or irritant agents in the home or work environment, including tobacco smoke".

Severe asthma with good response to Type 2 targeted therapy — re-evaluate the need for each asthma medication every 3–6 months, and emphasize to patients and their primary care physician that they should not completely stop ICS-containing therapy; base the order of reduction or cessation of add-on treatments on potential adverse effects, the observed benefit when the medication was started, patient risk factors, cost, and patient satisfaction. Minimizing the use of OCS is a very high priority, and after reducing/ceasing any medication, confirm asthma stability before making any further treatment changes. If asthma remains well controlled, consider ceasing other therapies, based on the above considerations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^8ae64598]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment of asthma in adults, adolescents, and children 6–11 years — assess asthma control (symptom control AND future risk of adverse outcomes), including symptom control over the last 4 weeks or longer; measure lung function at diagnosis/start of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (e.g., at least once every 1–2 years; more often in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma); assess treatment issues (document the patient's current treatment step; watch inhaler technique, assess adherence and side-effects; check that the patient has a written asthma action plan; ask about the patient's attitudes and goals); and assess multimorbidity, since rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression and anxiety can contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and sometimes to poor asthma control.

Assessing asthma severity — The current concept is that asthma severity should be assessed retrospectively from how difficult the patient's asthma is to treat, reflected by the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations after at least several months of treatment; by this definition, severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, and must be distinguished from difficult-to-treat asthma due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, adherence problems, or comorbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity.

Assessing future risk of exacerbations, lung function decline and adverse effects — the second component of assessing asthma control is to identify whether the patient is at risk of adverse asthma outcomes, and asthma symptoms are not sufficient on their own because symptoms can be controlled by placebo or sham treatments or by inappropriate use of SABA or LABA alone, respiratory symptoms may be due to other conditions or comorbidities, anxiety or depression may contribute to higher symptom reporting, some patients have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction with few symptoms despite low lung function, and in patients with good symptom control exacerbations can be triggered by environmental exposures; therefore, asthma symptom control and exacerbation risk should not be simply combined numerically.

### Asthma exacerbations. 4: prevention [^45dd72a1]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are common. They account for a significant morbidity and contribute a disproportionate amount to the cost of asthma management. The optimal strategies for the prevention of asthma exacerbations include the early introduction of anti-inflammatory treatment-most commonly, low dose inhaled corticosteroids. This should be coupled with a structured education programme which has a written action plan as an integral component. Where patients continue to be poorly controlled, the addition of a long acting beta agonist should be considered. The latter should not be used as monotherapy and should always be used with inhaled corticosteroids. Atopic patients with a history of repeated exacerbations, especially if they are steroid dependent and with a raised IgE, may be considered as potential candidates for omalizumab. In the early stages of an asthma exacerbation, doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids has been shown to be ineffective. The ideal strategy for the management of worsening asthma in patients on combination treatment, especially salmeterol and fluticasone, is uncertain. There is an emerging body of evidence for strategies on how to prevent progression to an exacerbation in patients taking a combination of budesonide and formoterol.

### A multinational observational study identifying primary care patients at risk of overestimation of asthma control [^7dee1c73]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The study identified factors associated with patient's overestimation of their actual level of asthma and highlighted the significant hidden burden associated with under-recognition of poor asthma control, on the part of the patient. It raises the question about the causes for this under-recognition and questions the way in which we ask patients about asthma control. While some of the factors associated with under-recognition may be modifiable, there is an urgent need for targeted interventions that include new strategies, measures and terminology designed to address the continuing discrepancy between perceived and actual disease control. Future qualitative research should explore the causes for under-recognition of poor asthma control as unless we are able to support patients to better align their perception of their asthma with their actual level of asthma control, we will continue to face some fundamental challenges with the management of asthma, and the increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with the poor self-management of this chronic respiratory disease.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^3038af3d]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

Poor asthma control was defined as any 1 of the following: use of short-acting β-agonists for asthma symptoms 2 or more times per week; nocturnal awakenings with asthma symptoms more than once per week during the month before enrollment; 2 or more emergency department visits, unscheduled physician visits, prednisone courses, or hospitalizations for asthma in the prior year; or a score of 1. 25 or higher on the Asthma Control Questionnaire at the screening visit. The primary outcome measure for the trial was change in ACQ score at the 24-week visit. 16 The ACQ integrates indicators of asthma control, including use of bronchodilators, nocturnal symptoms, cough, activity level, and pulmonary function, and has a range of 0 to 6. A
0. 5-point change in ACQ score reflects a meaningful clinically important difference in asthma control. Patients with ACQ scores of 0.

75 or less are classified as having well-controlled asthma and those with scores of

1. 5 or greater are classified as having inadequately controlled asthma. 17, 18. We defined 2 types of episodes of poor asthma control derived from the daily diaries: an episode of poor asthma control type 1 was a decrease of greater than 30% in morning peak flow rate from personal best for 2 consecutive days, addition of an oral corticosteroid to treat asthma symptoms, or unscheduled contact with a health care practitioner for asthma symptoms. An episode of poor asthma control type 2 also included increased use of short-acting β-agonists from baseline. Episodes of poor asthma control type 1 excluded use of rescue medications because we were concerned that heartburn symptoms could be mistaken for asthma symptoms and result in increased rescue medication use.

One hundred fifty-two participants underwent 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring studies. Of these, 115 had adequate results for interpretation, 49 of whom had abnormal esophageal acid exposure as assessed by frequent acid reflux events, prolonged acid reflux episodes, or overall 24-hour esophageal acid reflux greater than established thresholds. The mean ACQ score at screening was high and consistent with poor asthma control in both groups. Between the screening and randomization visits, ACQ scores decreased in both groups.

Provide a written asthma action plan with advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers, and check inhaler technique and adherence. For management of exacerbations in children 5 years and younger, see Section 12 (p.196).

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. Treatment Asthma severity is defined by the treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Well-controlled asthma involves daytime symptoms or as-needed medication use twice a week or less, no activity limitation, and no waking with symptoms. Severity is assessed after several months of regular controller treatment. Mild: Asthma is well controlled with step 1 or 2 treatment. Moderate: Asthma is well controlled with step 3 treatment. Severe: Step 4 or 5 treatment is required to control symptoms, or symptoms are uncontrolled despite this treatment.

GINA recommends that a SABA not be prescribed as sole therapy because short-acting medications increase the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Adding an ICS daily or as needed reduces this risk. GINA also recommends using the lowest dose of ICS tolerated, including reducing the corticosteroid dose after symptoms are controlled. Clinicians should check inhaler adherence and treat any modifiable risk factors before considering a step up in treatment. A step down should be considered if asthma has been controlled for three months. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation.

If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended. A subsequent study demonstrated that as-needed combination therapy reduced severe exacerbations in mild and moderate asthma, which was highlighted as a POEM in AFP. These data, with evidence of increased severe exacerbations and mortality with as-needed albuterol alone, resulted in these dramatic changes in treatment recommendations for mild to moderate asthma. — Michael J.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^76d4ae38]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma.

In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report. The Expert Panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4:
Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.
Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams. Within a given step, an alternative option(s) is management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence than the preferred options. Clinicians and patients may choose the alternative treatments if individuals with asthma are currently receiving this therapy and their asthma is under control, if the preferred treatments are not available or too costly, or if the individuals with asthma prefer an alternative treatment. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments. A lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options.
In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy.
The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams. Instead, these options are listed in Table IF.
The guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient managementand the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^12d1d1cc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment of asthma control — GINA clarifies that assessment of symptom control should not be limited to the most recent 4 weeks, that there are no validated tools for longer periods and recall-error is common, and that symptom control alone is not enough because risk factors for exacerbations, accelerated decline in lung function, and medication adverse effects must also be assessed; while inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce exacerbations and serious exacerbations in those not taking ICS are associated with greater decline in lung function, there is no clear evidence that ICS per se prevents long-term development of persistent airflow limitation.

### Budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for poorly controlled asthma… [^ce3b55e8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 randomized clinical trials that included 4863 patients with poorly controlled asthma, compared with maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA reliever, use of SMART with budesonide-formoterol was associated with a longer time to first severe asthma exacerbation. Meaning The findings suggest that SMART is associated with a longer time to first severe asthma exacerbation compared with step up or continuation of GINA treatment step with ICS-LABA plus SABA in patients with uncontrolled asthma. First, to provide a more robust definition of uncontrolled asthma, only patients who had an asthma control questionnaire score of 1. 5 or higher at baseline were included rather than additionally including patients who had used SABA on more than 5 occasions within 5 or more of the previous 7 days of a 2-week run-in. Time to first severe asthma exacerbation was the primary outcome variable.

A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration in asthma leading to treatment with an oral glucocorticoid for at least 3 days and/or hospitalization or an emergency department visit in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria. 7 Secondary end points included number of severe exacerbations, ACQ-5 score, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second measured at baseline and clinical visits at months 1 and 6. The magnitude of the difference between the regimens was substantive, with a 29% reduction in risk of severe exacerbations. These findings suggest that for patients with poorly controlled asthma, switching to budesonide-formoterol administered by the SMART regimen at the same or higher level of treatment may be preferable to increasing to a higher level of treatment with maintenance ICS-LABA and SABA as required.

However, data were also available for other key measures, such as ACQ-5 and FEV1, which had greater improvement in patients who received the SMART regimen, but the differences were below the recognized minimal clinically important differences. 18 This finding suggests that the main benefit associated with the SMART regimen is a reduction in risk of severe exacerbations, whereas symptom control and lung function may be maintained or modestly improved. All analyzed studies were of at least 24 weeks' duration, but longer-term data spanning many years are not available for SMART or for RCTs of other ICS-LABA treatments.

Adults and adolescents — referral and assessment for persistent symptoms: Patients of any age with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite correct inhaler technique and good adherence with Step 4 treatment should be referred to a specialist with expertise in investigation and management of severe asthma, if available (Evidence D), and the section heading specifies to refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on therapy. In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

Children 5 years and younger — stepwise management and prerequisites before stepping up therapy: Treatment follows a stepwise approach with medication adjusted up or down to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk, and the need for controller treatment should be re-assessed regularly. If symptom control is poor and/or exacerbations persist despite 3 months of adequate controller therapy, confirm that symptoms are due to asthma rather than another condition (and refer for expert assessment if in doubt), check and correct inhaler technique, confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose, consider a trial of another treatment option for that step, and enquire about risk factors such as allergen or tobacco smoke exposure before stepping up.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment (assessment), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to review patients with asthma regularly, ideally 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, and within 1 week after an exacerbation,
to monitor symptom control, risk factors and occurrence of exacerbations, as well as to document the response to any treatment changes.

### Approaches to stepping up and stepping down care in asthmatic patients [^63716596]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The variability in symptom control is a challenging feature of asthma that necessitates careful monitoring and the need to step up and step down individualized therapeutic regimens over time. This stepwise concept in asthma therapy can be considered in at least 3 contexts. For lack of control that is persistent over long periods of time, an increase in the overall medication or a step-up long-term strategy is indicated. A second approach, the step-up short-term strategy, can be used during a temporary loss of acceptable control, such as at the onset of a viral respiratory tract illness. In these cases a step-up in therapy is usually terminated in 3 to 10 days once asthma control has been satisfactorily achieved. Finally, for treating symptoms related to the variability of asthma on a day-to-day basis, inhaled corticosteroids used concomitantly with a β-agonist have been evaluated, although this treatment is not currently approved in the United States. We will term this particular intervention a step-up intermittent strategy. Here we summarize the existing data regarding these 3 approaches to step up care and step down management, as well as to identify areas where more comparative studies are necessary to provide further guidance to clinicians regarding proper step-up and step-down strategies in the care of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^749529cb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma self-management — regular review by a healthcare provider or trained healthcare worker — should include asking the patient if they have any questions or concerns with discussion of issues and additional educational messages as necessary and referral to someone trained in asthma education if available; it should also assess asthma control, risk factors for exacerbations, and comorbidities by reviewing the patient's level of symptom control and risk factors, asking about flare-ups and whether the patient's response was appropriate (e.g., was an action plan used?), reviewing the patient's symptom or PEF diary, and assessing comorbidities; and assess treatment issues by watching the patient use their inhaler and correcting and re-checking technique if necessary, assessing medication adherence and asking about adherence barriers, asking about adherence with other interventions, and reviewing the asthma action plan and updating it if level of asthma control or treatment have changed. Follow-up consultations should take place at regular intervals, a single-page prompt to clinicians has been shown to improve the provision of preventive care to children with asthma during office visits, and follow-up by telehealthcare is unlikely to benefit patients with asthma that is well controlled at a low treatment step, but may be of benefit in those with severe disease at risk of hospital admission.

Adding Long-Acting Inhaled Beta 2 Agonists to Inhaled Corticosteroids in Poorly Controlled Mild to Moderate, Persistent Asthma. RCTs have found that, in people with asthma that is poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids, adding regular long-acting inhaled beta 2 agonists improves symptoms and lung function compared with adding placebo or a leukotriene antagonist. We found insufficient evidence about effects of adding long-acting inhaled beta 2 agonists on mortality. Low-Dose, Inhaled Corticosteroids in Mild, Persistent Asthma. Systematic reviews and RCTs have found that, in people with mild, persistent asthma, low doses of inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms and lung function compared with placebo or regular inhaled beta 2 agonists.

### A multinational observational study identifying primary care patients at risk of overestimation of asthma control [^bfad24f6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions worldwide, affecting ~30 million people in Europe and more than 5 million people in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite the existence of a global strategy for asthma management, and availability of national guidelines and effective treatments, rates of poor asthma control remain high worldwide. – Poor asthma control reduces patients' quality of life and productivity, increases health care utilisation and the risk of exacerbations and mortality. Further, poor asthma control poses a greater economic burden on individuals, communities and health care systems than controlled disease.

When it comes to disease control, the patient experience of symptoms over time is extremely important. Unfortunately, this is one of the great challenges in asthma management. Many patients who consider their asthma to be 'well controlled' often overestimate their actual level of asthma control. While a discrepancy between patient-perceived and actual disease control is frequently reported, the reasons for and the factors related to this disparity remain unclear. Identifying patients at risk of overestimation of asthma control remains elusive.

The ramifications of overestimating level of disease control on the part of the patient are far-reaching. Many patients who mistakenly consider their asthma to be 'well controlled' often accept their symptoms as being part of the 'norm' of having asthma and are unlikely to seek asthma-related information, education or care from health care practitioners (HCPs). Further, since guideline treatment options are based on patient-reported symptoms, appropriate treatment may not be prescribed if a patient fails to recognise and report poorly controlled symptoms to their HCP. Patients who do not voice their concerns or under-report troublesome symptoms run the risk of under-treatment and the perpetuation of poor asthma control and a potential increased future risk of adverse outcomes. This under-reporting of symptoms by patients also emphasises the need for more objective measures such as spirometry and symptom questionnaires in clinical practice.

### Asthma out of control? A structured review of recent patient surveys [^5cb6f822]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Overall, pediatric patients seemed to be better managed than adults with asthma, not simply because there tends to be a stronger emphasis on childhood asthma in most countries, but also because caregivers and parents seemed to show greater involvement in managing their children's disease and were highly conscious of drug safety issues. The surveys did, however, highlight parents' confusion about, and their lack of understanding of, childhood asthma and its therapies. A number of parents (approximately 40%) in one survey regarded asthma in their children as a stigma and were in potential denial of their children's condition. This clearly represents an opportunity for further patient and caregiver education.

As with the adult populations, there was a strong difference between perception of control (by children and their caregivers) and the practical issues of symptom management. In general, children utilized a proportionately greater share of resources than adults. A recent review of epidemiological surveys and clinical studies of asthma in children reports evidence of poor asthma control in children: only a small proportion of children worldwide attain the goals of good asthma control as set out by the Global Initiative for Asthma.

A common theme that emerges from many of the surveys is the dissatisfaction and poor outcomes seen with asthma controller medications. Among the numerous reasons for this are concerns over safety, poor efficacy, and poor adherence. Encouragingly, both patients and their HCPs generally seemed to agree within the same survey that there was a need to use medications with fewer side effects and fewer long-term complications. There was, however, some evidence of differences in opinion among physicians on the best strategy for long-term and more complete asthma control.

Our report evaluates asthma management from the patients' perspective. The 24 surveys reviewed illustrate the burden of asthma in patients and attitudes toward its diagnosis and treatment among patients as well as HCPs, including asthma specialists, pediatricians, general practitioners, pharmacists, and nurses. A limitation of the present review is therefore that it constituted a qualitative analysis and hence could be considered a subjective appraisal. A true quantitative meta-analysis was not possible because of the variety in study designs, as well as in populations and outcomes studied. Moreover, the selection of studies was not fully comprehensive; instead, we chose to include a varied selection of surveys to provide as balanced a perspective as possible. The surveys originated in many different countries in Europe and North America and were conducted by different sponsors, including three different pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, we believe some important and consistent messages emerge that should influence better asthma management in the future.

### Step 4: stick or twist? A review of asthma therapy [^f86501ec]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The evidence for pharmacological therapy at step 4 of the 2014 BTS/SIGN asthma management strategy is limited and current use of asthma therapy at this stage in the clinic relies heavily upon small clinical trials, broad licence indications, extrapolation from mild and moderate disease and observational evidence. Clinical trials are required to inform which of these treatments to try first and whether or not there are asthma phenotypes associated with specific treatment responses. The new era of biologics is likely to change how we view asthma severity and the step-up/step-down paradigm outlined in the 2014 version of the BTS/SIGN guidance may become less relevant, with stratified and personalised medicine becoming more important in the management of step 4–5 asthma.

Areas for improvement

The shift in treatment recommendations in favour of ICS–formoterol fixed combination heralds a change in the right direction as it represents tailoring of asthma management to patient needs by harnessing patients' innate behaviours. Historically, strategies to improve patient adherence to regular anti-inflammatory therapy with either ICS or ICS–LABA have not always resulted in significant improvements either because they are too complex and/or they increase patient burden by being too labour intensive. The recommendation of as-needed ICS–formoterol as the preferred reliever in mild asthma patients and in those treated with ICS–formoterol is likely to have a positive impact as it uses a patient's natural relief-seeking behaviour (due to the fast-acting property of formoterol for symptom relief) to effect change without the need to change patient behaviour.

It is also increasingly evident that having asthma symptom control as the purpose of asthma treatment has not yielded desired results. Poor asthma control remains widespread across all severities. Poor medication adherence, lack of a self-management asthma action plan, poor patient–physician communication and comorbidities can make asthma control challenging. Patients with well-controlled asthma or mild intermittent asthma also experience life-threatening exacerbations. Thus, a paradigm shift towards population-based preventive care, rather than a predominant focus on symptom control, is needed.

Timely and accurate diagnosis of asthma and its phenotypes is also needed to identify individuals most in need of treatment. As per the GINA strategy, diagnosis of asthma is based on a history of characteristic respiratory symptoms and evidence of variable airflow limitation. However, accurate diagnosis of asthma in primary care is hindered by many factors, including failure to use objective lung function tests, challenges associated with measuring lung function, development of late-onset asthma and different causes of observed symptoms. The availability of specialised centres, which make available multiple specialists beyond pulmonologists, such as allergists and gastroenterologists, may help facilitate accurate diagnosis of more complicated patients, such as those who fail to achieve control, have comorbidities and/or have a severe disease; however, for the majority of patients, primary care can play an integral role in identifying 'treatable traits' (such as severity, airflow limitation, eosinophilic airway inflammation and atopy) and providing timely, appropriate treatment.

Asthma with COPD features — initial therapy and combinations: Start treatment as for asthma until further investigations have been performed; inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential in preventing morbidity and even death in patients with uncontrolled asthma symptoms; for patients with asthma+COPD, ICS should be used initially in a low or medium dose, and patients with features or diagnosis of both asthma and COPD will usually also require add-on LABA and/or LAMA to provide adequate symptom control; patients with any features of asthma should not be treated with LABA and/or LAMA alone, without ICS; observational evidence cited includes a large case-control study showing lower risk of COPD hospitalizations and death with combination ICS-LABA than with LABA alone in community patients with newly diagnosed COPD who also had a diagnosis of asthma, and a large cohort of patients aged ≥ 66 years in which those recorded as having asthma with COPD had lower morbidity and hospitalizations if they received ICS treatment.
