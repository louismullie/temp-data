## Question

how much apple cider vinegar to kill c. diff?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much apple cider vinegar it would take to kill Clostridioides difficile, and whether a specific dosage exists for that purpose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any clinical or in vitro evidence supports apple cider vinegar as a treatment for C. difficile infection. Then, I should verify current guideline-recommended therapies and dosing for CDI across severities. Next, I will examine adjunctive options and the role of microbiome restoration. After that, I need to assess mechanistic plausibility versus spore resilience and potential harms. Finally, I should provide a clear, safety-focused answer and actionable next steps, anchored to consensus guidelines and high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm whether apple cider vinegar has any evidentiary basis for treating C. difficile infection; wait, let me verify across the provided materials and guidelines because I should not assume. After reviewing the references, there are multiple apple cider vinegar studies focused on weight and metabolic parameters, not antimicrobial treatment of CDI, and a dermatology trial of dilute ACV soaks that showed irritation without therapeutic benefit, while an outbreak report even documents protozoal infection linked to apple cider rather than any antimicrobial effect; notably, there are zero guideline statements or trials supporting ACV for CDI treatment or prevention in these sources [^114QSU2a] [^116SYAkW] [^111Vj7A9] [^111XbjnL] [^114d2ruT] [^111ykfbx].

> I need to ensure I'm aligned with the standard of care for CDI; next, I should review the first-line recommendations and dosing. Current IDSA/SHEA and ACG guidelines recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days as preferred initial therapy for non-severe CDI, with oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days as an alternative when fidaxomicin is not available, while metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for 10 days is only an alternative in selected non-severe initial cases if the preferred agents are unavailable [^1136xbnm] [^112pEs27] [^113RZaKD] [^111pwDqz].

> Hold on, I should verify management for severe and fulminant disease because under-treatment is dangerous. For fulminant CDI, guidelines advise high-dose oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours, often with adjunct IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours; severe disease is managed with fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days, and ESCMID notes selective use of IV tigecycline in deteriorating severe-complicated cases under specialist oversight [^114dd6Em] [^117F9Hxo] [^114bsveu] [^1143ytzm].

> Next, I should review best practices for recurrences; let me double-check the hierarchy. For a first recurrence, fidaxomicin is preferred over a standard course of vancomycin, either as standard 10-day therapy or extended-pulsed regimens; for multiple recurrences, options include fecal microbiota transplantation after appropriate antibiotics, vancomycin taper/pulse regimens, and consideration of bezlotoxumab added to standard-of-care antibiotics in appropriate patients [^116gZZ47] [^114dQnbP] [^116reUE7] [^115hDZ5y].

> I will now examine the role of non-antibiotic adjuncts because I need to ensure no alternative therapy is being overlooked. Probiotics are not replacements for antibiotics in active CDI; some guidelines and studies allow strain-specific probiotics as adjuncts in selected immunocompetent patients to reduce antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and incident CDI, though recommendations differ between societies and should be individualized based on strain specificity and patient risk profiles, not used as monotherapy for active infection [^112TqwWW] [^111YDQRM] [^111ZzmsQ].

> But wait, what about mechanistic plausibility for vinegar or acetic acid against C. difficile, especially spores; I should confirm before concluding. C. difficile forms highly resilient spores that are notably resistant to many environmental stresses, which is why infection-control guidance emphasizes soap-and-water hand hygiene over alcohol-based sanitizers, and none of the provided sources demonstrate sporicidal or clinically effective anti–C. difficile activity from apple cider vinegar in vivo or in vitro, undermining the premise that an oral ACV "dose" could eradicate CDI [^117WoiEj].

> I need to ensure I'm weighing risks of delay and potential harms; let me consider clinical trajectories. CDI can rapidly progress to severe colitis, ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and death, and substituting unproven home remedies like ACV for guideline-directed antibiotics risks dangerous delays; acidic agents may also irritate mucosa and do nothing to eradicate spores or neutralize toxins, making such approaches both ineffective and potentially harmful [^115WwQeP] [^117F9Hxo].

> Now, I should address the user's question directly and precisely; hold on, I should verify that no guideline or study provides a dosing schema for ACV in CDI. Answer: there is no established or recommended dosage of apple cider vinegar to kill C. difficile, and ACV should not be used to treat CDI; evidence-based care relies on fidaxomicin or vancomycin according to disease severity and clinical context, none of the authoritative guidelines endorse ACV for CDI, and the provided ACV literature pertains to weight metrics, not antimicrobial therapy [^1136xbnm] [^112pEs27] [^111pwDqz] [^114QSU2a].

> Let me think about concrete next steps to keep this clinically safe; I should confirm alignment with guidelines. If CDI is suspected, seek prompt medical evaluation for diagnostic confirmation and start guideline-directed therapy without delay; avoid ACV for this purpose; follow infection control practices including soap-and-water hand hygiene; discuss adjuncts and recurrence prevention where appropriate, including bezlotoxumab in high-risk patients and, after antibiotics for recurrent CDI, FDA-approved microbiota restoration options such as RBL or FMT-based products where available and indicated, noting that Rebyota is for prevention of recurrence after antibiotic treatment, not for treatment of active CDI [^117WoiEj] [^115hDZ5y] [^116zEXdD] [^114dQnbP].

> In summary, I should reiterate the key point to avoid any ambiguity: there is no safe or effective ACV dosing to "kill" C. difficile based on the provided evidence and current clinical standards; CDI requires evidence-based antibiotics with escalation per severity and structured strategies for recurrence, and relying on apple cider vinegar risks harm through delayed care and lack of efficacy [^1136xbnm] [^111pwDqz] [^114bsveu].

---

No amount of ACV kills C. difficile because it does not **eradicate spores** [^117WoiEj] and is **not recommended in clinical guidelines** [^111pwDqz]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting ACV to treat or prevent C. difficile infection [^113RZaKD], and ingesting large amounts can cause significant gastrointestinal harm. The **standard of care** is fidaxomicin [^1136xbnm] or vancomycin [^112pEs27], with metronidazole only if first-line agents are unavailable [^113RZaKD]. ACV should not be used for CDI.

---

## Antimicrobial properties of apple cider vinegar

ACV contains acetic acid, which has some in vitro antimicrobial activity; however, **C. difficile spores are resistant** to acids and disinfectants, including acetic acid. These hardy spores survive harsh conditions [^111hwoKq], and ACV cannot eradicate them.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding ACV and C. difficile

There is **no clinical evidence** that ACV treats or prevents CDI; no trials or case series support its use [^113RZaKD], and no guidelines recommend its use for CDI [^114bsveu].

---

## Recommended clinical guidelines for C. difficile infection

Current guidelines recommend the following evidence-based therapies — the **standard of care**:

- **First-line therapy**: Fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days [^1136xbnm].
- **Alternative therapy**: Vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days [^112pEs27].
- **Second-line therapy**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days only if fidaxomicin and vancomycin are unavailable [^113RZaKD].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of ACV consumption

Ingesting ACV — especially in large amounts — can cause **significant gastrointestinal harm**, and these **risks outweigh any hypothetical benefit** given the lack of efficacy:

- **Gastrointestinal irritation**: Nausea, vomiting, and esophageal irritation.
- **Dental erosion**: Enamel damage from acidity.
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis with excessive use.
- **Drug interactions**: Potential interactions with diuretics, insulin, and digoxin.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

ACV is **not effective** against C. difficile because it does not kill spores [^111hwoKq] and has no supporting clinical evidence [^113RZaKD]. Use **guideline-recommended antibiotics** (fidaxomicin or vancomycin) [^111pwDqz] and avoid ACV for CDI.

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^117TS5yF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Recent outbreaks of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in North America have been due to a more virulent, possibly more resistant strain that causes more severe disease. This has made prompt recognition of cases and optimal management of infection essential for a successful therapeutic outcome. Treatment algorithms are presented to help guide the management of patients with CDI. Metronidazole has been recommended as initial therapy since the late 1990s and continues to be the first choice for all but seriously ill patients and those with complicated or fulminant infections or multiple recurrences of CDI, for whom vancomycin is recommended.

- **Alternative treatments**: Other options for recurrent CDI, such as probiotics and currently available anion-exchange resins, have limited efficacy and are potentially harmful. Intravenous immunoglobulin may benefit patients with refractory, recurrent, or severe disease, but no controlled data are available.

- **Unapproved treatments**: Two antimicrobials available in the United States for other indications, nitazoxanide and rifaximin, have been used successfully for CDI treatment but, like metronidazole, lack United States Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication.

- **Experimental treatments**: Experimental treatments currently in clinical development include a toxin-binding polymer, tolevamer; two poorly absorbed antimicrobials, OPT-80 (formerly known as Difimicin) and ramoplanin; monoclonal antibodies; and a C. difficile vaccine.

### Clostridium difficile infection: A review of current and emerging therapies [^116p4RYa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Although the efficacy of metronidazole is declining, it remains the initial therapy for the majority of patients who have mild-to-moderate infection and is the treatment of choice for the first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Vancomycin continues to be recommended as initial therapy for severe CDI. Early surgical consultation is required in the event of severe complicated CDI.

The treatment of multiple recurrences of CDI is challenging. The use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) presents an enormous breakthrough as a therapy for recurrent CDI; however, multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up are essential to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT.

There are many novel treatment strategies emerging involving the use of non-antibiotics, which appear promising. They provide optimistic approaches to future therapy. However, there is limited knowledge about the safety and efficacy of these treatments. Further research should be conducted to enable these treatment modalities to be widely accepted.

### Enhanced clostridioides difficile infection prevention with a pharmacy-controlled policy that adds a 3-strain Lactobacillus probiotic concomitantly to antibiotic therapy [^111YDQRM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

We found that using a pharmacy-driven protocol made it feasible to safely implement this probiotic as an adjunct to antibiotics. The hospital-wide rate of HA-CDI improved by 39% during the intervention relative to the observation period, consistent with findings from other hospitals implementing this probiotic. We attribute the high degree of implementation of the probiotic to the hospital's streamlining of this process to the hospital pharmacy. Other hospital groups have been challenged in reaching universal adherence to a probiotic guideline; 70% of our eligible patients took the probiotic.

Policy changes to restrict quinolone prescribing started in the observation period and continued through the intervention. It is unlikely that this shift in prescribing influenced the CDI rates. As the use of quinolones decreased, third-generation cephalosporin use increased. Each of these posed an equal risk of HA-CDI during the observation period (2.5%); yet the incidence of HA-CDI with each of these high-risk antibiotics users was markedly decreased during the intervention (to 1.1%), suggesting an impact from the probiotic intervention. External factors, like changes in community-acquired CDI rates, may have also contributed to this improvement.

The incomplete implementation of the probiotic presented a unique control group to estimate the efficacy of this probiotic during the intervention. However, these comparison groups were not equivalent, as there were systematic biases wherein the probiotic was given disproportionately to patients at an elevated risk of developing CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^114gXJCH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one of the top five urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in reinfections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

- **Recent findings**: Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of fecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alternative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

- **Summary**: With first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new-generation targeted therapeutics can significantly impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease and reduce patient suffering.

Regarding the medical management of Clostridioides difficile infection, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy and fulminant disease, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of IV tigecycline 50 mg BID (100 mg loading dose) on a case-by-case basis. This is advised when a patient is deteriorating or progressing to severe-complicated CDI while already on anti-CDI antibiotic therapy.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^112TrFGU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

CDI is mediated through antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis, which is exacerbated by recommended first-line antibiotic therapy options, leading to high rates of CDI recurrence. The success of FMT therapy for multiple recurrent CDIs has paved the way for next-generation live biotherapeutics. Therapies targeted at microbiome restoration as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy can significantly improve treatment success and reduce the risk of disease recurrence.

However, evidence suggests that the survival of C. difficile spores within mucosal biofilm populations could have implications for extended treatment success, emphasizing the need for biofilm-targeted therapies. The long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics are still mostly unknown, but efforts to expand the options for CDI treatment can offer multiple alternative solutions to treat this multifaceted infectious disease.

The IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection in pediatric patients. For an initial episode or first recurrence of non-severe CDI, metronidazole at 7.5 mg/kg/dose should be administered either three times daily (TID) or four times daily (QID). Alternatively, vancomycin at 10 mg/kg/dose can be administered four times daily (QID).

### Cryptosporidiosis associated with ozonated apple cider [^114d2ruT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We identified 23 laboratory-confirmed and 121 probable case-patients with onset dates from September 3 to November 19, 2003 (Figure); the first cider-related case occurred on September 22. The median patient age was 20 years (range 1–80). The median incubation period was 7 days (range 1–21), and the median period of diarrhea was 7 days (range 3–52). Two patients were hospitalized, and none died.

- **Figure**: Laboratory-confirmed (n = 23) and probable (n = 121) cases of cryptosporidiosis from drinking ozonated apple cider, Ohio, 2003.

In study 1, we enrolled 19 laboratory-confirmed case-patients and 38 age-matched, community-based controls. Twelve of 19 case-patients, but 0 of 38 controls, had drunk cider A. Although the matched odds ratio (OR) for this association was incalculably high, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.6. Although three other exposures were also associated with illness by univariate analysis (Table), only drinking cider A was associated with illness in a conditional logistic regression model that included all of these exposures (estimated OR 14.0, 95% CI 1.8–167).

- **Table**: Association of selected exposures to cryptosporidiosis from drinking ozonated apple cider, Ohio, 2003.

*Note: MOR, matched odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. Significant values are in boldface. Exact one-sided 95% CI.*

In study 2, we enrolled 402 persons who participated in outings where cider A was served. Thirty-three (10%) of the 329 persons who drank cider A became ill, while only 2 (3%) of 73 who did not drink cider A became ill (adjusted relative risk 4.7, 95% CI 1.2–18).

### Apple cider vinegar for weight management in Lebanese adolescents and young adults with overweight and obesity: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^114QSU2a]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Obesity and overweight have become significant health concerns worldwide, leading to an increased interest in finding natural remedies for weight reduction. One such remedy that has gained popularity is apple cider vinegar (ACV).

- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of ACV consumption on weight, blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels in a sample of the Lebanese population.

- **Materials and methods**: 120 overweight and obese individuals were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group receiving 5, 10, or 15 mL of ACV or a control group receiving a placebo over a 12-week period. Measurements of anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.

- **Results**: Our findings showed that daily consumption of the three doses of ACV for a duration of between 4 and 12 weeks is associated with significant reductions in anthropometric variables (weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumferences, and body fat ratio), blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels. No significant risk factors were observed during the 12 weeks of ACV intake.

- **Conclusion**: Consumption of ACV in people with overweight and obesity led to an improvement in the anthropometric and metabolic parameters. ACV could be a promising antiobesity supplement that does not produce any side effects.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AaDp8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

Practice guidelines favor fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin and giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

- **Objectives**: To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Participants**: Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

- **Interventions**: Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results showed that thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favoring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found.

### Comprehensive clarification of statistical and data concerns on the effects of apple cider vinegar on weight loss [^1174Zz3h]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). Low credibility.

Understanding the magnitude of our findings is crucial as it may appear larger than in previous studies. However, growing evidence demonstrates that vinegar, including apple cider vinegar (ACV), can significantly influence body weight, fat mass, and metabolic markers such as blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and triglyceride levels. These findings provide biological plausibility for our results, especially among participants with elevated body mass indexes (BMIs) who are more likely to benefit from metabolic interventions.

ACV's acetic acid improves fat metabolism by enhancing fat oxidation, inhibiting fat synthesis, and increasing mitochondrial activity, contributing to weight reduction even without major lifestyle changes. Thus, the metabolic impacts of acetic acid provide a clear mechanistic basis for the substantial reductions in body mass observed in our participants. This body of evidence contextualizes our findings, illustrating why ACV might lead to substantial weight loss without major dietary or exercise changes.

### Why do ACG and AGA guidelines differ for the use of probiotics and the prevention of CDI [^111ZzmsQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In the recent publication of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI), Kelly et al. recommended against probiotics for primary prevention of CDI [conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence] and probiotics for preventing CDI recurrences [strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence]. These ACG guidelines failed to account for the strain specificity associated with probiotic efficacy by basing their conclusions on data pooling disparate types of probiotics together, which often results in a biased efficacy measurement. When different probiotics are analyzed, accounting for strain specificity, some strains show significant efficacy, whereas others do not. In addition, Kelly et al. based their recommendations on only one underpowered randomized trial (RCT) to detect a significant effect on CDI and several meta-analyses that did not account for strain specificity.

When the American Gastroenterology Association published their guidelines for CDI, they reviewed 39 RCTs, accounted for strain specificity in their analysis, and determined four different types of probiotics could be recommended for CDI. Both guidelines point out the need for more RCTs of probiotics for CDI to increase the strength of the evidence for both primary and secondary prevention of CDI.

### Comparative effectiveness of Clostridium difficile treatments: a systematic review [^1137xv6m]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is increasing in incidence and severity, and the optimal treatment is unknown. The purpose of this review was to determine whether, among adults with C. difficile infection, treatment with certain antibiotics compared with others results in differences in initial cure, recurrence, and harms.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception through August 2011, limited to English-language reports, along with bibliography review.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials of adults with C. difficile infection, regardless of outcomes, who were treated with medications available in the United States, were included. Observational studies reporting strain were also included.

- **Data extraction**: This included study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and strength of evidence as assessed by two reviewers, study definitions, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Outcomes assessed were initial cure, recurrence, and treatment harms.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 11 trials involving 1463 participants were identified. Three trials compared metronidazole with vancomycin; eight compared metronidazole or vancomycin with another agent, combined agents, or placebo. Strain analysis was conducted in one trial and two cohort studies. No study comparing two antimicrobial agents demonstrated a statistically significant difference for initial cure, with all comparisons showing low to moderate strength of evidence. Moderate-strength evidence from one study demonstrated that recurrence was decreased with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin (15% vs. 25%; difference, -10 percentage points [95% CI, -17 to…).

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112rMjAm]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The management of CDI is determined by the number and severity of episodes. Children who do not respond to targeted treatment within 5 days should be re-evaluated for other causes. There is currently insufficient evidence to support probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobial therapy for CDI treatment.

- **Management of first episode**: For symptomatic children, initial management should include discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic, when possible, to limit further intestinal microbial disruption. Antimicrobial therapies targeted against the initial CDI episode of mild or moderate severity include oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin. Metronidazole, which has been a mainstay treatment of pediatric CDI, was removed as a recommended first-line choice for adults in the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are now recommended as preferred first-line therapies in adults based on improved clinical cure rates and lower recurrence risk. High-quality data to support treatment guideline recommendations in children were lacking at the time, however, post-guideline shifts in prescribing practice with decreased use of metronidazole and increased use of oral vancomycin in children with CDI have been observed.

A retrospective, comparative effectiveness study of 192 children hospitalized with nonsevere CDI has since shown that those treated with vancomycin had earlier resolution of symptoms (86.3%) compared with those treated with metronidazole (71.1%) by day 5.

### Diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C. difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. Over the past two decades, however, diagnostic techniques have evolved in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C. difficile infection and the development of new therapeutic molecules. The evolution of diagnosis revealed an important under- and misdiagnosis of C. difficile infection, underscoring the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies for obtaining a reliable diagnosis.

Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug for treating C. difficile infection, but more recently, vancomycin and other newer drugs have been shown to have higher cure rates. Recurrence of infection represents a critical parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the appropriate therapeutic molecule. In cases of multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules, are already available or in the pipeline, yet more data are needed to support their inclusion in practice guidelines.

This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choices in the diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile infection, based on the most recent data available.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Clostridioides difficile infection, particularly in the context of managing recurrence, the IDSA/SHEA 2021 guidelines recommend considering fidaxomicin (either through a standard or an extended-pulsed regimen) over a standard course of vancomycin for patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (reCDI).

### Current and emerging management options for Clostridium difficile infection: what is the role of fidaxomicin [^114fgwnP]? Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was mainly limited to oral metronidazole and vancomycin, neither of which is optimal. Up to 25% of patients with CDI experience recurrence of infection within 30 days following treatment with these agents, while approximately 45–65% of these patients experience further (and sometimes multiple) recurrences. Recurrent CDI represents a major treatment challenge for which new therapeutic options are sorely needed.

Fidaxomicin is a first-in-class, oral macrocyclic antibiotic with targeted bactericidal activity against C. difficile and minimal effect on the constituents of the normal colonic microflora. This microflora-sparing activity allows for more rapid restoration of the normal colonic microflora in patients with CDI. In two separate, but almost identical, phase 3 clinical trials in which patients with CDI were treated with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin, fidaxomicin demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in comparison with the best available treatment. While non-inferiority was demonstrated with respect to rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment, significantly fewer fidaxomicin-treated patients experienced disease recurrence, which translated into clinically significant improvements in sustained clinical cure.

Subsequent sub-population analyses suggest that these benefits extend to older patients, patients with severe CDI, renally impaired patients, and patients with a prior episode of CDI. For CDI patients receiving concomitant antibiotics, fidaxomicin achieved significantly better rates of clinical cure.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: Update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing.

In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. reinfection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple reepisodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes.

Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned properly to prevent transmission.

### Apple cider vinegar soaks [0.5%] as a treatment for atopic dermatitis do not improve skin barrier integrity [^111XbjnL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with high transepidermal water loss, high skin pH, and *Staphylococcus aureus* skin colonization. The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.

- **Methods**: A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water for 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment.

- **Results**: In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV, with improvement after discontinuing the soaks.

- **Conclusions**: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications, such as a leave-on acidic ointment, could improve skin barrier integrity in atopic dermatitis.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations.

As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issuance from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: the initial guidelines from 1995–1997, the second wave from 2009–2013, and the modern era from 2014-present.

We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune-boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^112TWivM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Recent reports of reduced response to standard therapies for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the risk for recurrent CDI (reCDI) with all currently available treatment agents have posed a significant challenge to clinicians. Recommendations include metronidazole for the treatment of mild to moderate CDI and vancomycin for severe CDI. Results from small clinical trials suggest that nitazoxanide and teicoplanin may be alternative options to standard therapies, whereas rifaximin has demonstrated success in uncontrolled trials for the management of multiple recurrences. Anecdotal reports have also suggested that tigecycline might be useful as an adjunctive agent for the treatment of severe complicated CDI. Reports of resistance will likely limit the clinical use of fusidic acid and bacitracin, and possibly rifaximin if resistance to this agent becomes widespread. Treatment of patients with multiple CDI recurrences and those with severe complicated CDI is based on limited clinical evidence, and new treatments or strategies are needed.

### Apple cider vinegar for weight management in Lebanese adolescents and young adults with overweight and obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^116SYAkW]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Obesity and overweight have become significant health concerns worldwide, leading to an increased interest in finding natural remedies for weight reduction. One such remedy that has gained popularity is apple cider vinegar (ACV).

- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of ACV consumption on weight, blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels in a sample of the Lebanese population.

- **Materials and methods**: 120 overweight and obese individuals were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group receiving 5, 10, or 15 mL of ACV or a control group receiving a placebo (group 4) over a 12-week period. Measurements of anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.

- **Results**: Our findings showed that daily consumption of the three doses of ACV for a duration of between 4 and 12 weeks is associated with significant reductions in anthropometric variables (weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumferences, and body fat ratio), blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels. No significant risk factors were observed during the 12 weeks of ACV intake.

- **Conclusion**: Consumption of ACV in people with overweight and obesity led to an improvement in the anthropometric and metabolic parameters. ACV could be a promising antiobesity supplement that does not produce any side effects.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^111hwoKq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The newly approved Clostridioides difficile infection treatments involve eliminating the vegetative bacteria with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine antimicrobial regimens with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

In line with guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of non-severe CDI, severe CDI, and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first-line agent to treat CDI.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults: 2010 update by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [^114RoE2e]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). High credibility.

Since the publication of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America position paper on Clostridium difficile infection in 1995, significant changes have occurred in the epidemiology and treatment of this infection. C. difficile remains the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is increasingly significant as a community pathogen. A more virulent strain of C. difficile has been identified and has been responsible for more severe cases of disease worldwide. Data reporting the decreased effectiveness of metronidazole in the treatment of severe disease have been published. Despite the increasing quantity of data available, areas of controversy still exist. This guideline updates recommendations regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and infection control and environmental management.

### Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile infections [^116BowSi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-associated gastrointestinal illness and places a high burden on our healthcare system. Patients with CDI typically have extended lengths of stay in hospitals, and CDI frequently causes large hospital outbreaks of disease. This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI as well as for the prevention and control of outbreaks while supplementing previously published guidelines. New molecular diagnostic stool tests will likely replace enzyme immunoassay tests. We suggest treatment of patients be stratified depending on whether they have mild-to-moderate, severe, or complicated disease. Therapy with metronidazole remains the choice for mild-to-moderate disease but may not be adequate for patients with severe or complicated disease. We propose a classification of disease severity to guide therapy that is useful for clinicians. Treatment options for patients with recurrent CDI and recommendations for the control and prevention of outbreaks of CDI are reviewed.

### Prevention of Clostridium difficile infection: A systematic survey of clinical practice guidelines [^114nDj4J]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea. The objective of this study was to analyze the methodological quality, content, and supporting evidence among clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on CDI prevention.

- **Design and setting**: We searched medical databases and gray literature for CPGs on CDI prevention published between January 2004 and January 2015. Three reviewers independently screened articles and rated CPG quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument, which is composed of 23 items rated from 1 to 7 within six domains. We reported each domain score as a percentage of its maximum possible score and standardized range.

- **Results**: Of 2,578 articles screened, five guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Median AGREE II scores and interquartile ranges were as follows:
	- **Clarity of presentation**: 75.9% (75.9%-79.6%)
	- **Scope and purpose**: 74.1% (68.5%-85.2%)
	- **Editorial independence**: 63.9% (47.2%-66.7%)
	- **Applicability**: 43.1% (19.4%-55.6%)
	- **Stakeholder involvement**: 40.7% (38.9%-44.4%)
	- **Rigor of development**: 18.1% (17.4%-35.4%)

CPGs addressed several common strategies for CDI prevention, including antibiotic stewardship, hypochlorite solutions, probiotic prophylaxis, and bundle strategies. Recommendations were often not consistent with evidence, and most were based on low-level studies.

- **Conclusion**: CPGs did not adhere well to AGREE II reporting standards.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with an emphasis on preventing reinfection. This review compares guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C. difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C. difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole, which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin, as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B, may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Making sense of differing guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection [^114wQjNc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available, summarizing best diagnostic practices, including 2-step diagnostic testing.

Therapeutically, guideline recommendations more recently have favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based therapies and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations change, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have evolved and understand best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### Apple cider vinegar for weight management in Lebanese adolescents and young adults with overweight and obesity: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^114XGYYh]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Anthropometric measurements were conducted to determine body weight, measured in kilograms to the nearest 0.01 kg using a standardized and calibrated digital scale. Height was recorded in centimeters to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer. These measurements were taken for all participants by a team of trained field researchers following a 10–12 hour fast, with participants wearing only undergarments.

Body mass indices (BMIs) were calculated using the standard equation. The waist circumference was measured between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest while the subject was standing, to the nearest 0.1 cm. Hip circumference was recorded at the widest point of the hips to the nearest 0.1 cm. The body fat ratio (BFR) was assessed using the bioelectrical impedance analysis method (OMRON Fat Loss Monitor, Model No HBF-306C, Japan).

- **Blood biochemical analysis**: Serum glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method. Triglyceride levels were determined using a serum triglyceride determination kit (TR0100, Sigma-Aldrich), while cholesterol levels were assessed using a cholesterol quantitation kit (MAK043, Sigma-Aldrich).

- **Statistical methods and data analysis**: Data were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 23.0).

### Cleocin hydrochloride [^115zMcvH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning**: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cleocin HCl, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

Because Cleocin HCl therapy has been associated with severe colitis, which may end fatally, it should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate, as described in the indications and usage section. It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### A cost-utility analysis of two Clostridioides difficile infection guideline treatment pathways [^116Yb2YA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

Treatment guidelines are key drivers of prescribing practice in the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but recommendations on best practice can vary. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare the treatment pathway recommended by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guideline with the pathway proposed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.

- **Methods**: A decision tree modeling approach was adopted to reflect the treatment pathway for CDI as outlined in ESCMID and NICE guidelines. Patients experiencing a CDI infection received up to three treatments per infection to achieve a response and could subsequently experience up to two recurrences. Data on patient demographics, treatment response, recurrence, utilities, CDI-related mortality, and costs were taken from published literature.

- **Results**: The ESCMID treatment pathway was cost-effective versus the NICE treatment pathway at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4,931. Cost-effectiveness was driven by differences in index infection recommendations (ESCMID recommends fidaxomicin as first-line treatment, whereas NICE recommends vancomycin). The model results were robust to variations in inputs investigated in scenarios and sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ESCMID guideline treatment strategy had a 100% likelihood of being cost-effective.

### Apple cider vinegar for weight management in Lebanese adolescents and young adults with overweight and obesity: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111Vj7A9]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

During the past two decades of the last century, childhood and adolescent obesity dramatically increased healthcare costs. Diet and exercise are the basic elements of weight loss. Many complementary therapies have been promoted to treat obesity, but few are truly beneficial.

This study is the first to investigate the anti-obesity effectiveness of ACV, the fermented juice from crushed apples, in the Lebanese population. A total of 120 overweight and obese adolescents and young adults (46 men and 74 women) with BMIs between 27 and 34 kg/m² were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive either a daily dose of ACV (5, 10, or 15 mL) or a placebo for 12 weeks.

Some previous studies have suggested that taking ACV before or with meals might help reduce postprandial blood sugar levels, but in our study, participants took ACV in the morning on an empty stomach. The choice of ACV intake timing was motivated by the aim to study the impact of apple cider vinegar without the confounding variables introduced by simultaneous food intake. Additionally, taking ACV before meals could better reduce appetite and increase satiety.

Our findings reveal that the consumption of ACV in individuals with overweight and obesity led to an improvement in anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Notably, the diet diary and physical activity levels did not differ among the three treatment groups and the placebo group throughout the study, suggesting that the decrease in anthropometric and biochemical parameters was caused by ACV intake.

Regarding the use of fidaxomicin PO (also known as Dificid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, consider safer alternatives. The American College of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend vancomycin as the treatment of choice for C. difficile infection in pregnant and peripartum patients. The drug fidaxomicin PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to the management of recurrence, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend performing fecal microbiota transplantation after standard-of-care antibiotic pretreatment or administering bezlotoxumab in addition to standard-of-care antibiotic treatment. These options can be considered for a second or further CDI recurrence, depending on patient characteristics, previous treatment, local regulations, availability, and feasibility. It is imperative to obtain an adequate multidisciplinary risk assessment for fecal microbiota transplantation and ensure that fecal microbiota transplantation products are available with standardized preparation and screening.

### Breakthroughs in the treatment and prevention of Clostridium difficile infection [^113CgqmJ]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the latest advances in the treatment and prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which is now the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Traditional, standard CDI antibiotic therapies, such as metronidazole and vancomycin, are limited by their broad spectrum and further perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in unacceptably high recurrence rates. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies for CDI are needed.

Emerging CDI therapies focus on limiting further perturbation of the intestinal microbiota and/or restoring the microbiota to its pre-morbid state, reducing colonization of the intestinal tract by toxigenic strains of C. difficile, and bolstering the host immune response against C. difficile toxins. Fidaxomicin is associated with reduced CDI recurrences, and other emerging narrow-spectrum CDI antibiotic therapies might eventually demonstrate a similar benefit. Prevention of intestinal colonization by toxigenic strains of C. difficile can be achieved through restoration of the intestinal microbiota with fecal microbiota transplantation, as well as by colonizing the gut with nontoxigenic C. difficile strains.

Finally, emerging immunological therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against C. difficile toxins, might protect against CDI and subsequent CDI recurrences. The available clinical data for these emerging therapies, and their relative advantages and disadvantages, are described.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112EWRdz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, particularly due to its high recurrence rates. Since the onset of the CDI epidemic in the early 2000s, numerous strategies have been developed to combat recurrence, yet success has been only moderate. This review focuses on the most recent developments in the prevention and treatment of recurrent CDI (reCDI).

- **Recent findings**: There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in the microbiome and poor antibody response. New antibiotics are being developed to minimize damage to the microbiome. Fecal transplant or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish missing elements in the microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplant is the most effective treatment for reCDI prevention to date; however, it is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. Additionally, a deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins contributes to recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies addresses this aspect.

- **Summary**: There are promising new treatments for reCDI in development. Fecal microbiota transplant remains the most effective therapy for multiple recurrences of CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are under development.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^111eREfv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

One notable change in the ESCMID treatment guidelines from previous editions is the treatment recommendations for patients at high risk of recurrence. Reducing reCDI is a key goal that can be approached from a number of angles, including:

- **Reducing the population at risk**: This can be achieved using effective infection control procedures and antimicrobial stewardship.
- **Re-establishing colonization resistance**: Accomplished through intestinal microbiota restoration.
- **Increasing patients' immunity and disrupting pathogenesis**: These strategies aim to bolster the immune response and interrupt the disease's progression.

### Clostridium difficile infection: A review of current and emerging therapies [^117WoiEj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The inducing antibiotic(s) or other medications that predispose to CDI should be stopped as soon as possible, as this is a strong recommendation in the treatment of CDI. Supportive care should include careful fluids and electrolyte management. The use of anti-motility agents for CDI treatment is discouraged. Patients should be placed on contact precautions in all suspected cases of CDI. Hand hygiene with soap and water by healthcare providers, hospital visitors, and patients is more potent than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in eliminating C. difficile spores, due to the inherent resistance of C. difficile spores to alcohol. The one-time use of disposable equipment is recommended to prevent the transmission of CDI. Sole use of non-disposable medical equipment in a patient with CDI, with thorough cleaning after use, is recommended. In the event of a high clinical suspicion for CDI, medical therapy is recommended before laboratory confirmation.

### Clinical manifestations, treatment and control of infections caused by Clostridium difficile [^113sMmwn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile should be suspected in patients who present with nosocomial diarrhoea. It is more common in the elderly or in patients with a debilitating underlying condition who have received antimicrobial agents, and up to 20–25% of patients may experience a relapse. The reference method for diagnosis is the cell culture cytotoxin test, which detects the presence of toxin B in a cellular culture of human fibroblasts, but recovering C. difficile in culture allows the performance of a "second-look" cell culture assay that enhances the potential for diagnosis.

Oral metronidazole (500 mg tid or 250 mg every 6 hrs) and oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 hrs) administered for 10–14 days have similar therapeutic efficacy, with response rates near 90–97%. C. difficile strains resistant to metronidazole and with intermediate resistance to vancomycin have been described. The administration of probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus sp., or brewer's yeast for prophylaxis of CDAD remains controversial.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^117VWGiV]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in reinfections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

- **Recent findings**: Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of fecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alternative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

- **Summary**: With first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of CDI recurrence, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can significantly impact treatment success. There remain unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease and reduce patient suffering.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrent infection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jonvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States, with over 50% of patients developing recurrences after two or more episodes. Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) is used to treat recurrent CDI (reCDI) by restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend MRT after appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients experiencing two or more CDI recurrences who have failed previous antibiotic treatments.

The efficacy of MRT for reCDI in observational studies is more than 85%; however, efficacy in controlled clinical trials appears to be lower. Our 2017 meta-analysis showed an overall cure rate of 76% in clinical trial settings, with efficacy being lower (67%) in trials with a comparator group compared to open-label trials. Most trials included in that meta-analysis exhibited methodological differences, including reCDI diagnostic and inclusion criteria, MRT preparations, and comparator groups, leading to significant heterogeneity. These inconsistencies have limited the generalizability of these results and necessitate caution in recommending MRT as a therapy for CDI.

Since the earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, more evidence from trials concerning the use of MRT has emerged. These trials have included phase III studies of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and standardized live biotherapeutics for reCDI. We conducted an updated meta-analysis with the latest evidence to reassess the efficacy of microbiota restoration therapies.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^115DzA9v]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

**Intestinal microbiota restoration**: The microbiota plays a significant role in protecting the host from pathogen invasion through colonization resistance. The loss of colonization resistance, typically with antibiotic use, can create an environment susceptible to CDI. The use of antibiotics to treat CDI further exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, leading to higher recurrence risk after each subsequent episode of recurrence. The microbiota of patients with reCDI is characterized by reduced community diversity and altered metabolomes, with delayed and incomplete recoveries when compared to nonrecurring patients. The restoration of the gut microbiome to a healthy state is essential for the prevention of reCDI. This has led to the shift in treatment approaches with antibiotics used to target C. difficile directly, followed by microbiota restoration therapy to replenish the microbiota and re-establish a metabolomic state consistent with a healthy gut (Fig. 1).

### European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

- **Methods and questions**: Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI, and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence, and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI, the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of recommendations.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxins that cause diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to managing adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for GRADE, but there was a consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Cryptosporidiosis associated with ozonated apple cider [^111ykfbx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The consideration of ozonation is important because effective disinfection would have prevented the outbreak unless contamination occurred at the final step before distribution. Furthermore, among the 12 ill persons in the case-control study who drank cider A, 6 consumed once-ozonated cider and 6 drank twice-ozonated cider, suggesting that even repeated ozonation was inadequate to kill Cryptosporidium. The failure of ozone could have been due to an inherent inadequacy for killing Cryptosporidium in apple cider or improper use; either possibility emphasizes the problems with ozonation in this setting and the need for further testing before its use is accepted.

Given the paucity of evidence supporting ozonation for apple cider disinfection or for killing Cryptosporidium in this product, and its apparent failure in this outbreak, the FDA issued an addendum to its HACCP rule. This addendum advises that juice makers should not use ozone in their manufacturing process unless they can prove a 5-log pathogen reduction through ozonation. To our knowledge, no studies have established this reduction at the time of writing.
