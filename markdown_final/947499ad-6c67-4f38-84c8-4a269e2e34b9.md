## Question

UTI treatment and management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about UTI treatment and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the UTI syndrome and patient risk factors. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to culture and how to interpret urinalysis. Next, I will consider antimicrobial stewardship and empiric therapy choices by scenario, followed by definitive therapy and duration. After that, I need to address special populations, prevention strategies, and emerging therapies. Finally, I will integrate cost-effectiveness and patient preference to synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because everything downstream depends on it; uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women is distinct from complicated UTI, which includes men, pregnant patients, structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromise, recent instrumentation, or systemic features, and I should also distinguish asymptomatic bacteriuria, which generally should not be treated outside specific exceptions like pregnancy or certain urologic procedures [^1135gEPy] [^11183VFt] [^113Ym5hA].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach for uncomplicated cystitis; in women with classic symptoms and no red flags, empiric treatment without culture is acceptable, but I should obtain a urinalysis if the presentation is atypical or if there are risk factors for resistance or complications, and I need to remember that dipsticks have limited negative predictive value, so a negative dipstick does not reliably exclude UTI in a high pretest probability setting [^113i5848] [^11157egT].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of culture; for complicated UTI, pregnancy, suspected pyelonephritis, or recurrent infections, obtaining a culture before antibiotics is recommended, and in children with suspected UTI, culture thresholds and urinalysis interpretation are critical, with pyuria plus at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen supporting the diagnosis in appropriately collected specimens [^114JpJPa] [^116Gz7Mn].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are front and center; resistance is rising, so I should minimize unnecessary antibiotics, avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, and align empiric choices with local antibiograms, patient-specific risk factors, and prior antibiotic exposures, including avoiding fluoroquinolones if there has been recent exposure to that class [^113w9t1z] [^111s2fcA].

> Next, I will examine empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis; first-line options remain nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX where resistance is under 20%, and fosfomycin, with beta-lactams as alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable, and I should double-check that nitrofurantoin is avoided in significant renal impairment and that TMP-SMX is not used if there is recent sulfa exposure or high local resistance, while keeping in mind that fluoroquinolones are generally discouraged for uncomplicated cystitis due to collateral damage and resistance selection [^112e6Ry3].

> Let me consider duration carefully; for uncomplicated cystitis, 5 days of nitrofurantoin, 3 days of TMP-SMX if susceptible, and single-dose fosfomycin are acceptable regimens, and I should confirm that shorter courses reduce adverse effects without compromising efficacy when chosen appropriately, reserving longer durations for select scenarios such as pregnancy or diabetes where evidence is less definitive [^113w9t1z].

> For complicated UTI without sepsis, I should confirm that empiric choices include third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones only when local resistance is low and there are no recent fluoroquinolone exposures, and I need to ensure timely de-escalation to culture-directed therapy and transition to oral agents when clinically stable, with typical total durations around 7 to 14 days depending on response and source control needs [^112xZtgT] [^112bPvv4].

> But wait, what if the patient has sepsis or bacteremia; in that case, I should initiate prompt parenteral therapy with agents active against likely resistant gram-negatives, consider combination therapy initially if critically ill, and then step down to targeted therapy, and I should double-check that for cUTI with gram-negative bacteremia, a 7-day total course is reasonable if the patient is improving on effective therapy, counting from the first day of effective treatment [^117Vq6gK] [^116fXk2s].

> I will now examine pyelonephritis; in nonpregnant adults without severe illness, oral fluoroquinolones are effective if resistance is under 10%, while TMP-SMX is acceptable only if the isolate is susceptible, and for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral therapy, parenteral ceftriaxone, a fluoroquinolone, or piperacillin-tazobactam are appropriate, with total durations commonly 7 to 14 days depending on severity and clinical response [^117BsxsL].

> Let me think about pregnancy; I should confirm that first-line therapy is beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or cephalexin for 5 to 7 days, avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester and near term, and reserve fluoroquinolones for compelling indications, with urinalysis and culture recommended at the first prenatal visit and during any symptomatic episode to guide therapy.

> For men, I need to check that treatment durations are generally longer, often 7 to 14 days for cystitis due to higher likelihood of prostatic involvement, and I should consider obtaining a culture and tailoring therapy, with fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX reasonable empiric choices based on local resistance and patient factors, while avoiding nitrofurantoin for suspected prostatitis due to poor tissue penetration [^117BsxsL].

> In pediatrics, I should confirm that infants and young children with fever require urinalysis and culture, that oral and parenteral therapy are equally efficacious, and that imaging for vesicoureteral reflux is reserved for select groups such as those with febrile UTI, abnormal renal ultrasound, or recurrent infections, balancing the risks of overtreatment against missed anomalies [^114vUek1].

> For catheter-associated UTI, I need to ensure I treat only symptomatic infections, avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in specific procedural contexts, remove or replace the catheter when feasible, obtain a culture from the newly placed device if replaced, and select therapy per complicated UTI guidance, with particular caution to avoid empiric fluoroquinolones in urology settings or after recent exposure [^115Xk6Uu] [^114XQfpU] [^114umbrL].

> Next, I should review prevention of recurrent UTI; nonantibiotic options with supportive evidence include vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women, methenamine salts, and possibly D-mannose, while antibiotic prophylaxis options include continuous daily therapy, postcoital dosing, or patient-initiated treatment in carefully selected, reliable patients, and I should confirm that guidelines emphasize minimizing antibiotic exposure and aligning choices with patient preferences and recurrence burden [^114AqSwd] [^1171guRo] [^112kKQCz].

> Hold on, I should verify the evolving stance on symptomatic management; some patients with acute cystitis can be managed with NSAIDs and delayed antibiotics, but symptom burden is higher and failure rates are greater than immediate antibiotics, so shared decision-making is essential, and I need to ensure safety netting for progression or complications if a delayed approach is chosen [^114NRmJS] [^114eitib].

> I will now examine emerging therapies; vaccines and phage therapy are promising but not yet standard of care, so they should be considered investigational, and I should double-check that current stewardship frameworks still prioritize narrow-spectrum, culture-directed therapy and de-escalation whenever possible to mitigate resistance [^113w9t1z] [^1168gWXy].

> Let me reconsider cost-effectiveness; modeling and trials suggest that obtaining a culture at the same time as empiric therapy is often the most cost-effective strategy across a range of resistance prevalence, balancing symptom relief and resistance costs, and I should align this with local workflows and patient values regarding symptom duration and antibiotic exposure [^114SJE14].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm; classify the syndrome and patient risk, decide whether to culture, choose empiric therapy based on severity, local resistance, and patient factors, reassess at 48 to 72 hours to de-escalate or adjust based on culture, and for recurrent disease, individualize prevention with shared decision-making, ensuring I have not overlooked red flags that would push me toward broader empiric coverage or urgent intervention [^116uTTsD] [^114AqSwd].

UTI management centers on **empiric therapy tailored to local resistance** [^1135gEPy] and patient factors, with **short-course regimens** for uncomplicated cystitis (nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin) [^112e6Ry3] and longer courses for complicated disease or pyelonephritis [^117BsxsL]. Obtain **urine culture** before antibiotics in complicated or recurrent cases [^114JpJPa], and de-escalate to narrow-spectrum agents when results are available [^112bPvv4]. For recurrent UTIs, use non-antibiotic strategies (vaginal estrogen, methenamine, D-mannose) [^1171guRo] or antibiotic prophylaxis (continuous, postcoital, or patient-initiated) [^114AqSwd] when indicated. Avoid treating **asymptomatic bacteriuria** except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^11183VFt]. Emphasize **antimicrobial stewardship** [^113w9t1z] and patient education to reduce resistance and recurrence [^notfound].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort, and occasionally hematuria [^113i5848]; **complicated UTIs** may present with fever, flank pain, chills, or systemic symptoms [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory diagnosis

- **Urinalysis**: Pyuria and bacteriuria support diagnosis; nitrites and leukocyte esterase increase specificity [^11157egT].

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard; obtain before antibiotics in complicated, recurrent, or atypical cases [^114JpJPa].

- **Blood culture**: Indicated for suspected pyelonephritis or systemic infection [^notfound].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** [^1135gEPy] and patient-specific factors (allergies, renal function, pregnancy) [^115Xt1hM].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin (5 days) [^notfound] <br/> - TMP-SMX (3 days) if resistance < 20% [^114FafnN] <br/> - Fosfomycin (single dose) [^114FafnN] |
| Complicated UTI | - Fluoroquinolones (5–7 days) [^notfound] <br/> - Beta-lactams (7–10 days) [^notfound] <br/> - Aminoglycosides (short course) [^notfound] |
| Pyelonephritis | - Fluoroquinolones (7 days) [^117BsxsL] <br/> - Ceftriaxone (IV) [^117CU9Hp] <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam (IV) [^notfound] |
| Catheter-associated UTI | - Remove/replace catheter [^notfound] <br/> - Treat 7–14 days based on culture [^112bPvv4] |

---

## Definitive therapy and duration

Adjust therapy to culture and susceptibility results; **de-escalate to narrow-spectrum agents** when possible [^112bPvv4]. Typical durations are 5–7 days for uncomplicated cystitis, 7–14 days for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, and 7 days for catheter-associated UTI.

---

## Management of recurrent UTIs

### Non-antibiotic strategies

Non-antibiotic options include **vaginal estrogen** for postmenopausal women [^1171guRo], **methenamine salts** as an alternative prophylaxis [^1171guRo], and **D-mannose**, which may reduce recurrence in select patients [^notfound].

---

### Antibiotic prophylaxis

- **Continuous prophylaxis**: Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin [^notfound].

- **Postcoital prophylaxis**: Single dose after intercourse [^114FafnN].

- **Patient-initiated therapy**: Short-course treatment at symptom onset [^112kKQCz].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnancy

First-line agents include **beta-lactams** (amoxicillin, cephalexin) for 5–7 days; avoid fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX in the first trimester [^notfound].

---

### Pediatrics

Obtain **urine culture** before antibiotics; use amoxicillin, cephalexin, or nitrofurantoin for 7–14 days based on severity [^116Gz7Mn].

---

### Elderly patients

Avoid overtreatment of **asymptomatic bacteriuria** [^111gDBjm]; use narrow-spectrum agents and adjust for renal function [^113B3mZi] [^113ZsabT].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **patient education** on hydration, hygiene, and voiding after intercourse [^notfound]; behavioral modifications such as reducing irritants and maintaining regular bladder emptying; and antimicrobial stewardship with judicious antibiotic use to limit resistance [^113w9t1z].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **phage therapy**, which is under investigation for resistant infections [^1168gWXy], and **vaccines**, which are in development to prevent recurrent UTIs [^114TV6QX].

---

UTI management requires **accurate diagnosis**, **empiric therapy aligned with local resistance**, and **culture-guided de-escalation** [^1135gEPy]. Recurrent UTIs benefit from non-antibiotic and targeted antibiotic strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship is essential to curb resistance [^113w9t1z].

### Urinary tract infections in children [^1132FL8r]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^113efeWL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens highlight the need for alternative therapies. In this review we examine current management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1176LkpS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^1135gEPy]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^113TeMWT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1155Y44y]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial

General practitioners or practice nurses recruited patients with suspected urinary tract infection, either first time or recurrent, on presentation. The study included 309 non-pregnant adult women aged 18–70. The practitioner collected baseline symptoms, clinical information, and demographic details. Patients completed a symptom diary for 14 days. Patients were randomised to one of five management groups: empirical antibiotic treatment; empirical delayed antibiotics; antibiotic targeted by symptom score; antibiotic according to dipstick algorithm (nitrites or leucocytes and a trace of blood); or midstream urine analysis with symptomatic treatment until culture and sensitivity results were available and then antibiotics targeted accordingly. Full details of this trial are given elsewhere.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^114eitib]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care.

Participants 309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main outcome measures Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^114LsLE4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly in both the primary and secondary care settings. Despite being common, the inpatient management of UTIs has been suboptimal. Clinicians are often overtreating elderly patients on the basis of non-specific symptoms. In most cases, there are insufficient recorded enquiries of lower urinary tract symptoms. Urine samples are also poorly collected for cultures and sensitivities. Therefore, many patients may be treated with antimicrobials to which the causative organism is resistant.

This project aimed to look into potential strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. These include increasing adherence to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines on the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial therapy.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116uTTsD]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Updates in clinical management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^1171guRo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and burdensome in women. Here, we discuss challenges with our current models of care and how evolving insights into the female urogenital microbiome have advanced the understanding of how we diagnose, treat, and prevent recurrent UTIs in nonpregnant adult women. Traditional care models attribute recurrent UTIs mainly to gastrointestinal sources, resulting in significant emphasis on eradicating pathogens with potential overreliance on antibiotics. Evidence now shows that the bladder harbors a complex microbiome, with interactions between the urinary and vaginal environments and immune mechanisms at the bladder mucosal surface influencing infection susceptibility. Thus, in updated models of care, more emphasis is placed on enhancing the protective microbiome. This may be especially important in postmenopausal women, who experience microbiome shifts that increase vulnerability to recurrent infections, underscoring the role of estrogen therapy and microbiome-supportive interventions. Updated treatment approaches emphasize antimicrobial stewardship, advocating for confirmation of the diagnosis and delayed antibiotic initiation when safe, and judicious use of antibiotics for symptom relief. Prevention strategies highlight the importance of vaginal estrogen, methenamine salts, and other supplements rather than exclusive reliance on prophylactic antibiotics. Ongoing research into emerging therapies such as UTI vaccines and bacteriophage drugs may further decrease our reliance on antibiotics in the future. This clinical update underscores the need for individualized care plans that balance effective infection management while minimizing antibiotic-related harms, emphasizing a holistic, microbiome-centered approach to recurrent UTI prevention and treatment.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113fyWm7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^113B3mZi]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

UTI is often overdiagnosed and overtreated in the elderly population. Studies have suggested that UTI is misdiagnosed in 40% of hospitalised elderly patients. Clinicians often misdiagnose UTI in the elderly who present with non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue, malaise, or generalised weakness. Antibiotic therapies are commenced in this group of patients without sufficient evidence supporting a diagnosis of UTI. Therefore, it is unsurprising that UTI rates as the second most common reason for empirical antibiotic therapy in secondary care. While the SIGN guidance for the management of suspected bacterial UTI in adults recommends that urine cultures are appropriate in certain cases (where symptoms are resistant to trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, UTI in men and pregnant women), their algorithm for the treatment of UTI in the elderly recommends the collection and analysis of urine samples in all cases, once a diagnosis of UTI has been made based on symptoms and signs. Antimicrobials should then be tailored in light of sensitivities, switching to narrow spectrum if possible. In view of increasing Clostridium difficile infection and antibiotic resistance, it is imperative that changes are made to the management of UTIs in the elderly population.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^114NRmJS]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in women. Most women experience at least one episode during their lives, and each year about 10% receive one or more courses of antibiotics for UTI. Most women with typical symptoms are treated empirically, though up to half of them do not have clinically significant bacteriuria, and evidence indicates that many women with symptoms of UTI will recover without antibiotic treatment.

Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo in women with uncomplicated UTI report a delayed cure in the placebo group, but most become symptom free within a week. Prescribing antibiotics to patients with self limiting conditions contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The World Health Organization considers antimicrobial resistance to be one of the three most important public health problems globally, and initiatives to reduce inappropriate and superfluous prescribing are essential if we are to maintain effective antibiotic treatment for future generations.

In a linked paper, Gágyor and colleagues (doi:) report a pragmatic double blind trial to investigate whether initial treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen can help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in women in primary care with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI. Nearly two thirds of women treated with ibuprofen did not receive antibiotics during the four week follow-up. They did, however, have a significantly higher burden of symptoms than women randomised to antibiotics (fosfomycin). Women given ibuprofen had their symptoms for a day longer, and about 60% (n = 143) still had still symptoms after four days compared with about half of those given fosfomycin initially. After one week, only 70% (n = 163) of women in the NSAID group were symptom free compared with 82% (n = 186) of women in the antibiotic group.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^115JzJsU]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

All management strategies for urinary tract infection have similar resource implications. The similarities in cost are not surprising as the tests used in this study have low costs and would entail only small changes to the time practitioners would need to provide care for a patient with a urinary tract infection. Therefore there is no strong reason to prefer any particular management strategy on the basis of costs. The duration of symptoms was similar between groups, with the dipstick strategy being associated with the shortest duration of symptoms. Compared with the group given immediate antibiotics, the dipstick strategy cost £10 per additional day of symptoms avoided.

Strengths and limitations

The current study is based on a randomised controlled trial with a rigorously developed dipstick algorithm and clinical score. The studied group comprised women in whom urinary tract infection was the suspected diagnosis. They had similar characteristics to national attending samples in the United Kingdomso study results should be representative of routine clinical practice. Data on resource was obtained from study records or from general practitioners' notes.

The cost effectiveness analysis shown here presents estimates of the cost per day of symptoms avoided. These results should be interpreted with caution because of the lack of significance in the effectiveness data. It is unclear why there were better outcomes in the dipstick group than in the immediate group as use of antibiotics was higher in the immediate group (96% v 76%). Those in the dipstick group, however, had less severe symptoms. The improvement in the dipstick group could be related to the security of feeling that they know from dipsticks that they do or do not have an infection.

We considered only costs related to the NHS; this might miss important costs such as travel and time off work, which might be relevant as 83% of the participants were aged under 60. We had details on time off work or study for 146/257 women and of these 48/146 (33%) needed time off because of their infection. There were no significant differences, however, between any of the groups so it is unlikely that considering these costs would have altered the results. Some additional travel costs would have been associated with reconsultations but these were low, with an average of 0.13 reconsultations during follow-up.

Our analysis excluded any benefits associated with reducing the use of antibiotics, such as less antibiotic resistance. Strategies that reduce use of antibiotics are thus undervalued. The highest numbers prescribed antibiotics were in the group prescribed immediate antibiotics (table 1).

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^111cLAQM]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

There is limited evidence on the cost effectiveness of different management strategies for urinary tract infection in primary care. Three studies used modelling to examine similar questions. The literature identified is either from the United States or the UK and hence the values presented here use different currency unit and cost years. To aid comparison we also present values in 2005–6 £ using UKor USinflation indicators and an exchange rate of $1.78 to the £; adjusted values are given in brackets. All the studies found that immediate (empirical) antibiotics were the least costly. A UK based study of management of urinary tract infection in general practice found that laboratory testing with empirical antibiotics resulted in earlier resolution of symptoms at a cost of £215 (£246) per day of symptoms avoided compared with empirical antibiotics. A US cost utility study found that compared with empirical treatment a complete urinalysis cost $2964 per additional QALM (quality adjusted life month) and dipsticks cost $48 460 per QALM (equivalent to £25 682 and £419 894 per QALY, respectively). A further study found that treatment for urinary tract infection with accompanying over-the-counter dipstick test cost between $5.50 and $1.97 (£4.14 and £1.48) per day of symptoms avoided, depending on how effective the dipstick was in directing treatment to those who actually had a urinary tract infection. These results are consistent with those presented here as they show that tests can be associated with additional costs and additional days of symptoms avoided.

Interpretation of results

Our analysis suggests that each additional day of symptoms can be avoided at a cost of about £10. A judgment would therefore need to be made of whether the value of avoiding days of moderate or severe symptoms would exceed this. The scenario analysis we constructed suggested that if a day of symptoms was associated with a utility loss of 0.2984 then the dipstick strategy could generate extra QALYs at a cost per QALY of around £12 000. This analysis should be treated with caution, however, as the estimate of 0.2984 was not derived directly from patients. More information on utility losses associated with urinary tract infection symptoms would be important in determining the value of days of symptoms avoided and hence in informing the care of affected patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^112uCnUB]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

All five management strategies for managing urinary tract infection in primary care achieved similar symptom control, and we found no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for laboratory testing. Antibiotic use targeted with dipstick testing with a delayed prescription as backup or empirical delayed prescription helped to reduce antibiotic use.

Potential limitations

Patients' diary records for acute illness are likely to be reliable, and supporting each strategy in a structured manner minimises any differential placebo effects. Type I error is possible for the subgroup analyses (which must be interpreted with caution), and type II error is unlikely (we had complete results in 277 (90%) patients so had more power than originally calculated). There was no evidence from auditing the use of envelopes, nor from the baseline tables, that randomisation was subverted. When there were modest differences between advice groups, we tested for confounding and found no evidence. In particular, although frequency symptoms were slightly (though not significantly) different at baseline between groups, controlling for baseline severity did not alter the inferences. The response to invitation, the mixed locations of practices, the range of demographics, and the similarity to observational cohortsshould make these results generalisable. There was group differentiation in dipstick use, midstream urine analysis, and the willingness of women to delay the use of antibiotics, but a detailed review of cases suggested that clinicians were likely to want to do a midstream urine test or document dipstick results in a few patients irrespective of initial antibiotic policy — sometimes because of patients' expectation (which might be expected to change over time as doctors' behaviour changes), sometimes for legitimate clinical reasons (such as uncertainty about development of complications), and occasionally because of an overly optimistic view of the accuracy of dipsticks (such as wanting adequate documentation, which might be misguided given the poor negative predictive values of dipsticks). Estimates of effect were little altered when these behaviours (that is, ordering midstream urine analysis or dipstick documentation) were included in the model, which suggests there was little confounding of results by such behaviours.

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^1168gWXy]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment is a growing public health concern owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Phage therapy, an alternative or adjunctive treatment to antibiotics, has the potential to address this challenge. However, clinical use of phage therapy is hindered by knowledge gaps and inconsistent reporting. The objective was to review the current state of phage therapy for UTIs and highlight research priorities that can optimize phage clinical efficacy.

Methods

Current literature on UTI phage therapy was examined, focusing on the lack of standardized phage susceptibility testing, phage characterization, and microbiological assessments during and after treatment.

Results

Critical areas requiring further investigation include appropriate phage dosing, optimal routes of administration, and the dynamics of phage–host and phage–patient interactions. The influence of the urinary microbiome, including endogenous phages, on treatment outcomes also needs to be better understood. Suggested data collection and reporting standards should be developed and implemented to improve clinical impact of studies examining phage therapy for UTI. Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish efficacy and determine the best practices for clinical use.

Conclusion

Phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics for managing UTIs, especially in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance. To fully realize its potential, however, future research must focus on standardized protocols, dosing strategies, and the role of the urinary microbiome, with an emphasis on rigorously conducted clinical trials. These steps are essential for integrating phage therapy into mainstream UTI treatment regimens.

### Imaging in urinary tract infections: current strategies and new trends [^112Gh2k2]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to detect abnormalities that require appropriate treatment or findings that can be acted on to prevent development of complications (hypertension, chronic renal failure or pregnancy-related complications). Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Management of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections in the older adult [^112HusbM]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^111pQQ63]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly. However, UTI is overdiagnosed and overtreated in this group. This project aimed to look into strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. A retrospective audit was performed on the case notes of medical inpatients in a district general hospital from December 2012 to April 2013. The target measures for improvement include increasing adherence to SIGN guidelines in the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial treatments.

Initial baseline measurement revealed 16 patients treated for UTI. 31.3% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for UTI. 68.5% had urine cultures performed. 60% of patients with positive urine cultures had correct antibiotic therapy after sensitivity results. The mean time from the diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture was 4 days.

Three further cycles were performed. Following each cycle, improvement measures were implemented to raise the awareness of medical staff about the management of UTI in the elderly. These comprised presentations to junior doctors at local teaching sessions; emails to ward managers with results of the previous audit cycle broken down by ward; and prominent display of guidelines on medical wards and ensuring availability of 'Newcastle pads' for taking sterile urine cultures from incontinent patients.

In the final cycle, 19 patients were diagnosed with UTI. 42.1% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for diagnosis of UTI. 89.5% had urine cultures sent. 86.7% of patients with a positive urine culture were treated with appropriate antibiotics after sensitivities became available. Mean time from UTI diagnosis to culture collection improved to zero days.

In conclusion, continuous educational measures, performance feedback, and increased availability of specialist equipment are imperative for improving management of UTIs in the elderly.

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: qualitative interview study [^1131qW9W]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Participants and procedure

Participants were recruited from a large randomised trial of different management strategies, in which patients were randomised within the consultation to one of five management groups: empirical antibiotic treatment; empirical delayed antibiotics; antibiotic targeted by symptom score (two or more of urine cloudy, urine with offensive smell, moderately severe dysuria, or nocturia); antibiotic according to dipstick algorithm (nitrites or leucocytes and a trace of blood); or mid-stream urine analysis with symptomatic treatment until culture and sensitivity results were available and then antibiotics targeted according) (box 1).

To be eligible for inclusion participants had to be taking part in the larger trial, have consented to have a single face to face interview, and have been allocated to a management group in which delayed antibiotics were specified by the protocol, meaning this option was discussed and negotiated flexibly with each patient, and they were given access to the delayed prescription at any stage. The third criterion ensured that we were able to explore participants' thoughts on the appropriate treatment of urinary tract infection and their views on the acceptability or otherwise of being asked to delay taking antibiotic medication. At interview it was clear that seven of the interviewees had in fact received antibiotic medication. We interviewed general practitioners in cases where the policy of delay was apparently not followed, and they reported patients' expectations as a prominent reason for negotiating a different strategy.

Patients were drawn from practices across Berkshire (Reading), Wiltshire (Salisbury), Hampshire (Romsey, Portsmouth, Waterlooville, Havant), and Dorset (Dorchester). GML and ST conducted the interviews in women's homes. Each interview lasted an hour on average and was audio-taped and transcribed verbatim by a professional freelance transcriptionist. GML checked 10 full transcriptions against corresponding audio-recorded interviews and found good accuracy. Subsequent quality checks were made during analysis.

The interviews

A semistructured topic guide ensured that critical topics were covered in every interview, while also providing the necessary flexibility to allow participants to volunteer topics that were germane to them. The interviews were designed to elicit participants' experiences and understanding of urinary tract infection, their beliefs regarding treatment, and their views about the management strategy of delayed antibiotic prescribing (that is, a prescription being available at reception (or, by negotiation with the general practitioner, that could be taken away) for use should symptoms not start to settle).

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116Gz7Mn]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: qualitative interview study [^1141wn4H]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Causes of urinary tract infection

All participants were asked what they thought caused urinary tract infection. Table 4 shows the range of causes volunteered by participants. Fifteen of the 20 women interviewed discussed previous experiences of urinary tract infection or cystitis, yet when asked to discuss the natural history/signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection most of the women struggled. Responses also indicated a need for increased opportunities for patients who attend with a suspected urinary tract infection to discuss the condition and the evidence (and uncertainty) about the effectiveness of antibiotic medication.

Table 4
Causes of urinary tract infection according to women presenting to primary care*. Authors' summaries or verbatim if shown in quotes

*Seven women were in symptoms score group, nine in empirical delayed group, and two each in symptoms score and mid-stream urine groups. We selected women for interview who had been asked to delay taking antibiotics to obtain their views on delay strategy. This would not apply to women in immediate empirical antibiotic group.

Lifestyle explanations were often cited as contributing to urinary tract infection. Women mentioned refraining from certain behaviours such as "drinking caffeine", "not drinking too much wine", and not being "negligent" when it comes to cleanliness. Embedded in most participants' reports was a "duty to stay healthy" and to live a life centred on the concept of self discipline (good diet, exercise, washing after sex, appropriate self care strategies when faced with symptoms, and so on) (table 4).

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^114TV6QX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^113i5848]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^1178XAiB]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Use of midstream urine analysis

There was no evidence that either using midstream urine analysis as an initial strategy to guide antibiotic prescribing or the use of midstream urine samples by doctors as part of their overall clinical management made any difference to ordering analysis during follow-up or other outcomes. As with antibiotic prescribing, as perceptions change among patients and doctors regarding the need for midstream urine analysis in clinical management of uncomplicated infections, use of laboratory resources for such an unnecessary investigation could be significantly reduced.

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples, and patients who delay waiting for results of such analysis by more than 48 hours might have poor symptom control. Antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription help reduce antibiotic use.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### Management of urinary tract infections in female general practice patients [^11157egT]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Though guidelines for the management of urinary tract infections (UTI) exist in several European countries, little is known about GPs' adherence, and the appropriateness of their management with regard to antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

To describe German GPs' management of female patients with symptoms of UTI, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks in a German general practice setting, to develop diagnostic prediction rules for culture-confirmed UTI, and to compare the adequacy of empirical treatment strategies and GPs' actual prescriptions.

Methods

In 36 (of 118 invited) teaching general practices, urine cultures and resistance testing were performed during 4 months on all symptomatic patients. GPs completed a questionnaire on each patients' symptoms, risk factors and treatment. Adequacy of different treatment approaches was calculated based on culture results.

Results

445 adult women (76% of all patients) were included, with a median age of 53 years. Complicating factors were present in 27%. Urine culture revealed UTI in 77%. GPs' diagnostic accuracy, using both dipsticks and clinical impressions, was low. A positive nitrite test, dysuria and older age were the only predictive factors of culture-confirmed UTI, however the negative predictive value of dipsticks is low (35%). Empirical treatment of all symptomatic patients with either nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolones would result in a higher rate of appropriate therapies than the individualized approach chosen by the GPs.

Conclusion

Most patients with urinary symptoms were not treated according to current guidelines, and GPs' diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy was low. Empirical treatment of all symptomatic patients is probably the most effective policy, but implies unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection and neurogenic bladder [^112MV4GD]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent, recurrent, and lifelong for patients with neurogenic bladder and present challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Patients often present without classic symptoms of UTI but with abdominal or back pain, increased spasticity, and urinary incontinence. Failure to recognize and treat infections can quickly lead to life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia or sepsis, whereas overtreatment contributes to antibiotic resistance, thus limiting future treatment options. Multiple prevention methods are used but evidence-based practices are few. Prevention and treatment of symptomatic UTI requires a multimodal approach that focuses on bladder management as well as accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^116jJuHr]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Continuous educational measures, performance feedback, and increased availability of specialist equipment are useful tools for improving the management of UTIs in the elderly. Small improvements in adherence to guidelines for UTI diagnosis were demonstrated. Additionally, it was shown that these measures could increase the number of urine cultures sent for both continent and incontinent patients, decrease the length of time from diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture, and increase the frequency with which appropriate antibiotics are used based on urine culture results. However, the relevance of the latter outcomes rests on the correct initial diagnosis of UTI. Larger studies are needed and should investigate whether these educational measures decrease hospital stay and mortality.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Urinary tract infections in long-term-care facilities [^1143GLrH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection occurring in residents of long-term-care facilities. It is a frequent reason for antimicrobial administration, but antimicrobial use for treating UTIs is often inappropriate. Achieving optimal management of UTI in this population is problematic because of the very high prevalence of bacteriuria, evidence that the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not beneficial, and the clinical and microbiological imprecision in diagnosing symptomatic UTI. This position paper has been developed, using available evidence, to assist facilities and healthcare professionals in managing this common problem.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^117BehL6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) management — Given the presence of bacteria in a healthy urinary tract, the text emphasizes that concepts about when antibiotics are necessary must evolve, noting that symptomatic treatment and expectant management can be appropriate for some even when acute bacterial cystitis is confirmed. It urges re-evaluating the assumption that all symptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotics and states that rUTI care should focus on symptom relief and prevention of complications rather than bacterial eradication.

### How can we improve investigation, prevention and treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections-ICI-RS 2018 [^114nR76z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is a chronic condition and has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. The commonly used definition for rUTI is greater than three episodes in a year or more than two in 6 months. Current diagnostic methods have been used worldwide for over five decades, despite well evidenced criticism. Enhanced culture techniques demonstrate that the microbiome of the bladder is far more complex than previously thought and begs a reappraisal of our current testing. Treatment of rUTI is based on a small number of antibiotic trials with some evidence showing a reduction in the number of positive cultures, but one must be cautious in interpreting the results and weigh against the risk of generation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Aim

The International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society think tank reviewed the literature with a view to improving investigation, prevention and treatment of rUTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team of experts were invited to present evidence regarding the current diagnostic methods, recent advances related to bladder biome mapping and current treatment strategies, including antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. Current guidelines regarding antibiotic stewardship and concerns regarding AMR were discussed.

Discussion

Outcome of the think tank discussions are summarised with a set of recommendations to inform future research. Particular consideration is given to bacterial survival in the bladder after treatment as well as defects in urothelial barrier function which may play a significant part in the failure to eradicate UTI.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections among women: comparative effectiveness of 5 prevention and management strategies using a Markov chain monte carlo model [^115VGBex]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem among women. However, comparative effectiveness strategies for managing recurrent UTIs are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature review of management of women experiencing ≥ 3 UTIs per year. We then developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo model of recurrent UTI for each management strategy with ≥ 2 adequate trials published. We simulated a cohort that experienced 3 UTIs/year and a secondary cohort that experienced 8 UTIs/year. Model outcomes were treatment efficacy, patient and payer cost, and health-related quality of life.

Results

Five strategies had ≥ 2 clinical trials published: (1) daily antibiotic (nitrofurantoin) prophylaxis; (2) daily estrogen prophylaxis; (3) daily cranberry prophylaxis; (4) acupuncture prophylaxis; and (5) symptomatic self-treatment. In the 3 UTIs/year model, nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was most effective, reducing the UTI rate to 0.4 UTIs/year, and the most expensive to the payer ($821/year). All other strategies resulted in payer cost savings but were less efficacious. Symptomatic self-treatment was the only strategy that resulted in patient cost savings, and was the most favorable strategy in term of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Conclusions

Daily antibiotic use is the most effective strategy for recurrent UTI prevention compared to daily cranberry pills, daily estrogen therapy, and acupuncture. Cost savings to payers and patients were seen for most regimens, and improvement in QALYs were seen with all. Our findings provide clinically meaningful data to guide the physician-patient partnership in determining a preferred method of prevention for this common clinical problem.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Vq6gK]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gDBjm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1116o5L4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11183VFt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1169qNxC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intended use

This document was developed following the process outlined in the Handbook for SHEA-Sponsored Guidelines and Expert Guidance Documents. No guideline or expert guidance document can anticipate all clinical situations, and this document is not meant to be a substitute for individual clinical judgement by qualified professionals. This document focuses on prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in acute-care hospitals. The strategies highlighted may or may not be applicable for other healthcare settings, such as ambulatory settings or long-term or postacute-care facilities. Furthermore, there may be differences in healthcare environments within the hospital (eg, acute-care wards vs intensive care units vs perioperative spaces, etc) that may affect the feasibility of specific recommendations, which should be considered by stakeholders implementing these strategies.

This document is based on a synthesis of evidence, theoretical rationale, current practices, practical considerations, writing group consensus, and consideration of potential harm, where applicable. A summary of the recommendations is provided in Table 1.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116vZ2qd]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Bacteriuria at catheter removal — evidence and rationale: one randomized controlled trial (RCT) in women reported 7 of 41 (17%) randomized to no treatment developed symptomatic UTI within 14 days, while 15 (36%) had spontaneous clearance of bacteriuria, with enrollment limited to those with a negative urine culture at insertion, no antimicrobial therapy while the catheter remained in situ, and bacteriuria at removal persisting 48 hours; a meta-analysis including 6 studies (5 surgical) initiated antimicrobials upon catheter removal irrespective of ASB and found benefit on subsequent UTI over 1 to 6 weeks with RD, –65/1000 [95% CI, –96 to –33], though studies were heterogeneous with high risk of selection and attrition bias; the rationale states, "We make a strong recommendation because there is very low certainty of any benefit and high-quality evidence of harm", and that there are no studies generalizable to current practice addressing screening for or treating ASB at catheter removal.

### Evaluation and management of urinary tract infection in the emergency department [^1153oX8h]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) affects patients of all ages and is a diagnosis that emergency physicians might make multiple times per shift. This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with infections of the urinary tract. Definitions of asymptomatic bacteriuria, uncomplicated UTI, and complicated UTI are presented, as well as techniques for distinguishing them. The pathophysiology and clinical and laboratory diagnoses of UTI are described. Treatment of UTI is reviewed, with attention to bacteriuria and special populations, including pregnant, elderly/geriatric, and spinal cord injury patients.

### Managing uncomplicated urinary tract infections… [^114FafnN]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Besides resistance patterns, antibiotic choice should include consideration of the patient's allergy history, the cost and tolerability of the medication, and previous antibiotic use. TMP-SMX has been the standard therapy for UTIs; patients with a sulfa allergy can take trimethoprim alone and achieve a similar cure rate. Side effects include skin rash, nausea, and vomiting. Patients who are concomitantly taking sulfonylureas need glucose monitoring because of the enhanced glucose-lowering effects of TMP-SMX. TMP-SMX therapy should be avoided in patients with liver impairment. Nitrofurantoin can be used in patients with normal renal function. Side effects are rare but may include malaise, cough, and dyspnea. Pulmonary fibrosis may rarely occur with long-term use. Fosfomycin is used as a single-dose treatment that is generally well tolerated but may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or esophageal discomfort. Antibiotics and dosing information for the treatment of UTIs are listed in.

Although single-dose therapy using betalactams, TMP-SMX, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones has a high cure rate, single-dose therapy is associated with a high rate of recurrence within six weeks of initial treatment. Reinfection may come from organisms remaining in the perianal area. Multiple-day regimens are considered more effective, although single-dose regimens are easier to use and generally better tolerated. Short-course therapy using three days of antibiotics appears to provide similar eradication rates with fewer side effects than a seven- to 10-day course. Patients who may benefit from the longer course of therapy include women who are pregnant, who have diabetes mellitus, or who have a history of urinary tract symptoms. Patients with recurrent UTIs can be offered continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis, patient-initiated treatment, or postcoital prophylaxis taken within two hours of sexual intercourse, if infection is associated with sexual activity.

Urine culture is appropriate before prophylactic therapy is started to establish the susceptibility of the pathogen. Patient-initiated therapy using a short course of antibiotics may be successful in younger women. The authors conclude that TMP-SMX and the fluoroquinolones are useful first-line treatments for uncomplicated cystitis. Other options include a seven-day course of nitrofurantoin or a single dose of fosfomycin.
