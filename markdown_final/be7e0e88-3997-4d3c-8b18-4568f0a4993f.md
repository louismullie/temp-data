## Question

can coumadin be 2.5

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Coumadin (warfarin) can be dosed at 2.5 mg and under what circumstances that is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about initial and maintenance dosing ranges. Then, I should verify whether a 2.5 mg tablet strength exists. Next, I will consider patient-specific factors that push dosing toward 2.5 mg, including age, genetics, and clinical context. After that, I should review guideline recommendations for special populations and scenarios where 2.5 mg is preferred. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, INR-based approach and confirm safety and monitoring considerations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing framework. The FDA labeling consistently states that when CYP2C9/VKORC1 genotypes are unknown, the usual initial dose is 2 to 5 mg once daily, with typical maintenance doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg once daily, and that dosing must be individualized to the INR response and indication, which means 2.5 mg sits squarely within the approved initial and maintenance spectrum [^1147kfhk] [^113HxqRf] [^116aJbF7].

> Wait, let me verify the tablet strengths before I assume 2.5 mg is a practical dose. The branded Coumadin tablets include a scored 2.5 mg strength, confirming that 2.5 mg is not only pharmacologically reasonable but also commercially available and designed to be split if needed, which supports using 2.5 mg as an actual prescribed dose in practice [^116ymYwf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — why would 2.5 mg be chosen over 5 mg at initiation? I need to check the factors that lower warfarin requirements: older age, low body weight, female sex, Asian ancestry, impaired nutrition or liver disease, heart failure, and interacting drugs all tend to reduce dose needs, and the label explicitly advises lower initial and maintenance doses in elderly and Asian patients, which is exactly where 2.5 mg often fits best [^1147kfhk] [^113HxqRf] [^114Ky28R].

> I should confirm pharmacogenetic implications next. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants can substantially reduce warfarin dose requirements, and patients with reduced-function CYP2C9 alleles or VKORC1 promoter variants may require markedly lower doses; importantly, the FDA labeling notes that carriers of certain variants can take longer to reach steady-state INR for a given dose, reinforcing the rationale to start low and titrate carefully, with 2.5 mg frequently being the prudent choice in these genotypes [^1147kfhk] [^113HxqRf] [^111LSgvG].

> Let me consider special clinical contexts where 2.5 mg is specifically favored. After heart valve surgery, patients are often warfarin-sensitive early postoperatively; a randomized trial showed that a fixed 2.5 mg start reduced excessive anticoagulation compared with a 5 mg load, supporting 2.5 mg as a safer initiation strategy in that setting, albeit with slower time to therapeutic INR but fewer overshoots, which is clinically meaningful for bleeding risk [^117DXKtn]. For elderly patients, observational data demonstrate that a 5 mg starting dose is excessive for the majority of patients over 70, with median maintenance doses around 3.1 mg/day in women ≥ 80 years, again arguing for 2.5 mg starts in many older adults to avoid over-anticoagulation [^1122G2GN]. In Asian populations, mean maintenance requirements around 3.3 mg/day have been reported, again supporting 2.5 mg as a reasonable initial dose in many individuals [^114LzMVq].

> Next, I should review guideline perspectives to ensure alignment. ACCP guidance suggests that for patients at higher bleeding risk — elderly, malnourished, liver disease, CHF, or otherwise vulnerable — starting doses of ≤ 5 mg are appropriate, and some scenarios even warrant 2–3 mg, which directly accommodates a 2.5 mg start when clinically indicated [^114Ky28R]. The Cochrane review comparing initiation strategies also found that lower initiation doses like 2.5 mg may take slightly longer to reach therapeutic INR but can reduce overshooting, reinforcing the safety rationale for using 2.5 mg in sensitive patients [^112P542H].

> I will now examine how to operationalize a 2.5 mg start in practice. Let me think about INR-guided titration: check INR about every 2–3 days early on, then adjust the dose in small increments (commonly 10–20%) based on the trend and target range for the indication, recognizing that early INR movement reflects factor VII decline and that the full pharmacodynamic effect evolves over 5–7 days; this measured approach helps avoid premature dose escalation when starting at 2.5 mg. I should double-check that the monitoring cadence and dose-adjustment philosophy match labeling and guideline advice, which emphasize frequent early INR checks and individualized adjustments rather than rigid loading regimens [^1169zF6V] [^114Ky28R].

> But wait, what if someone argues 2.5 mg is "too low" and won't achieve therapeutic anticoagulation promptly? I need to ensure I balance efficacy and safety. Evidence shows that while 2.5 mg may take a day or two longer to reach target INR compared with 5–10 mg, it reduces the risk of early supratherapeutic INRs and bleeding, and with appropriate bridging therapy for acute VTE and close INR follow-up, thrombotic protection is not compromised, which supports the legitimacy of 2.5 mg starts in the right patients [^112P542H] [^113BsFRi].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls. I should confirm that when using 2.5 mg, we avoid the temptation to "load" or double doses to catch up, because routine loading increases bleeding risk without improving time to stable anticoagulation meaningfully; the label advises against routine loading, and guidelines support INR-based titration after modest initial doses, which fits a 2.5 mg start strategy [^1147kfhk] [^114Ky28R].

> In summary, yes — Coumadin (warfarin) can absolutely be dosed at 2.5 mg, and this is an evidence-based, guideline-concordant choice for many patients, particularly older adults, those of Asian ancestry, individuals with reduced-function CYP2C9/VKORC1 variants, patients with nutritional compromise or liver disease, and in the early postoperative valve-surgery period; the key is to individualize to predicted maintenance needs, start low when sensitivity is expected, and titrate meticulously to the target INR range with frequent early monitoring [^1147kfhk] [^113HxqRf] [^114Ky28R] [^117DXKtn] [^1122G2GN] [^114LzMVq].

Yes, **Coumadin (warfarin) can be prescribed at 2.5 mg daily** as an initial or maintenance dose when clinically appropriate, particularly for patients who are elderly, have low body weight, liver disease, or are at high bleeding risk [^113HxqRf] [^114Ky28R]. The 2.5 mg tablet is available and scored for accurate dosing [^116ymYwf], and dosing must be individualized and adjusted to maintain a therapeutic INR (typically 2.0–3.0) [^113BLMww] [^114mnCwu]. Close INR monitoring is essential, especially during initiation and with any changes in medications, diet, or health status [^1169zF6V] [^113HWazC].

---

## Clinical indications for 2.5 mg dosing

Warfarin dosing is highly individualized, and a **2.5 mg daily dose** is appropriate in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Elderly patients**: Older adults often require lower warfarin doses due to increased sensitivity and higher bleeding risk [^1122G2GN] [^114Ky28R].

- **Low body weight**: Patients with low body weight may require lower doses to achieve therapeutic INR levels [^notfound].

- **Liver disease**: Hepatic impairment increases warfarin sensitivity, necessitating lower doses [^114GL3Xm].

- **High bleeding risk**: Patients with a history of bleeding or high bleeding risk may benefit from lower initial doses [^114Ky28R].

- **Genetic factors**: Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes can increase warfarin sensitivity, requiring lower doses [^1127rixV] [^113CnaTi].

---

## Availability of 2.5 mg tablets

Warfarin sodium tablets are available in multiple strengths, including **2.5 mg** [^116ymYwf]. The 2.5 mg tablets are scored, allowing for accurate dosing and flexibility in dose adjustments [^116ymYwf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** and careful monitoring when initiating warfarin therapy:

- **Initial dosing**: The initial dose of warfarin is typically 2–5 mg daily, adjusted based on patient-specific factors and INR response [^113HxqRf] [^1147kfhk].

- **Maintenance dosing**: Maintenance doses typically range from 2–10 mg daily, adjusted to maintain a therapeutic INR (usually 2.0–3.0) [^113HxqRf] [^114mnCwu].

- **Monitoring**: INR should be monitored frequently during initiation and dose adjustments, with the frequency decreasing once stable therapeutic levels are achieved [^1169zF6V] [^116Fi8pZ].

---

## Risks and benefits of 2.5 mg dosing

### Benefits

Benefits include a **lower bleeding risk**, particularly in elderly patients and those with high bleeding risk [^114Ky28R], and fewer INR fluctuations, which may improve time in the therapeutic range [^117DXKtn]. Lower initial doses can also reduce the risk of over-anticoagulation and associated complications [^112P542H].

---

### Risks

Risks include **under-anticoagulation** if the dose is too low, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events [^113GGcZH], and the need for close INR monitoring to ensure therapeutic levels are maintained [^1169zF6V].

---

## Clinical scenarios where 2.5 mg dosing is inappropriate

A 2.5 mg daily dose may be **inadequate** for patients who require higher warfarin doses to maintain therapeutic INR levels, such as those with:

- **High warfarin tolerance**: Patients with genetic polymorphisms resulting in rapid warfarin metabolism may require higher doses [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Certain medications may necessitate higher warfarin doses due to increased metabolism or reduced absorption [^notfound].

- **Dietary factors**: High vitamin K intake may require higher warfarin doses to maintain therapeutic INR levels [^1148EWDN].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of 2.5 mg dosing

Regular **INR monitoring** is essential when prescribing 2.5 mg warfarin. The INR should be checked frequently during initiation and dose adjustments, with the frequency decreasing once stable therapeutic levels are achieved [^1169zF6V] [^116Fi8pZ]. Dose adjustments should be based on INR results, patient-specific factors, and clinical judgment [^114mnCwu].

---

## Conclusion

Coumadin (warfarin) can be prescribed at a dose of **2.5 mg daily**, particularly for elderly patients, those with low body weight, liver disease, or high bleeding risk [^113HxqRf]. This dose is within the recommended initial dosing range and should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and INR response [^1147kfhk]. Regular INR monitoring is essential to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize bleeding risk [^1169zF6V].

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of COUMADIN varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of COUMADIN is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance COUMADIN doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

COUMADIN is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.

2.5 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.6 Intravenous Route of Administration

The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.

Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.

After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, and any unused solution should be discarded.

Asian Patients

Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms

The S -enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3, result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3, respectively.

Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.

Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR, a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (e.g., –1639G > A) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements.

CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the initial dose of warfarin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I² = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I² = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I² = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

Warfarin initiation dosing and timing — following the administration of VKAs, an initial effect on the INR usually occurs within the first 2 or 3 days and an antithrombotic effect occurs within the next several days. Initiation doses between 5 and 10 mg are effective, with individual responses varying according to the inpatient or outpatient status, age, concomitant treatments, and comorbidities; starting doses of ≤ 5 mg might be appropriate in the elderly, in patients with impaired nutrition, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, and in patients who are at high risk of bleeding. A dose of 2 to 3 mg seems to be appropriate for patients who have undergone heart valve replacement.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0).

In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors.

Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) is recommended.
For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) is recommended.
For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) is recommended.
For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) is recommended.

### Should we be applying warfarin pharmacogenetics to clinical practice? No, not now [^112Csx8u]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration modified warfarin labeling in 2007 to suggest, but not mandate, pharmacogenetic testing. Genetic analysis is now commercially available. However, results predict only one third of all dosing variation, the value of testing in reducing bleeding and thrombosis rates remains unproved, and cost-effectiveness is not established. Careful consideration of clinical factors that influence dosing, conscientious prothrombin time monitoring, and sage dosage adjustment remain paramount in warfarin management. Further study is required before routine warfarin pharmacogenetic testing can be recommended.

### Is there a role for warfarin anymore? [^116Ympvy]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Reduction of atrial fibrillation-associated stroke risk has become the leading indication for warfarin use. Optimal management of warfarin can only be achieved with a relatively complex infrastructure. Alternative anticoagulant agents have been developed, and 3 have demonstrated effectiveness, safety, and adherence that are comparable or superior to warfarin in the clinical trial setting. None of the novel agents requires routine laboratory testing to demonstrate effective anticoagulation. Whereas these new agents present potential advantages, such as fixed dosing and dramatically reduced intracranial hemorrhaging, they are also subject to caveats that ought to be considered in the context of an "ideal" anticoagulant. If used casually, they have the potential to worsen rather than improve health care outcomes. There is little question that the management burden of the novel agents will be less than with warfarin. However, with a hemorrhagic risk that was similar to warfarin in these trials, there will likely remain a significant need for both baseline education and some level of focused interval follow-up to assess for bleeding risk and adherence considerations. These novel agents offer a definite advance in the available management options for thromboembolic disease, but until we understand the requirements for safe and effective use in the routine clinical setting, we will not be able to establish the extent to which they should replace warfarin.

### A randomized and clinical effectiveness trial comparing two pharmacogenetic algorithms and standard care for individualizing warfarin dosing (coumaGen-II) [^113FHYjh]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is characterized by marked variations in individual dose requirements and a narrow therapeutic window. Pharmacogenetics (PG) could improve dosing efficiency and safety, but clinical trials evidence is meager.

Methods and Results

A Randomized and Clinical Effectiveness Trial Comparing Two Pharmacogenetic Algorithms and Standard Care for Individualizing Warfarin Dosing (CoumaGen-II) comprised 2 comparisons: (1) a blinded, randomized comparison of a modified 1-step (PG-1) with a 3-step algorithm (PG-2) (N = 504), and (2) a clinical effectiveness comparison of PG guidance with use of either algorithm with standard dosing in a parallel control group (N = 1866). A rapid method provided same-day CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping. Primary outcomes were percentage of out-of-range international normalized ratios at 1 and 3 months and percentage of time in therapeutic range. Primary analysis was modified intention to treat. In the randomized comparison, PG-2 was noninferior but not superior to PG-1 for percentage of out-of-range international normalized ratios at 1 month and 3 months and for percentage of time in therapeutic range at 3 months. However, the combined PG cohort was superior to the parallel controls (percentage of out-of-range international normalized ratios 31% versus 42% at 1 month; 30% versus 42% at 3 months; percentage of time in therapeutic range 69% versus 58%, 71% versus 59%, respectively, all P < 0.001). Differences persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and clinical indication. There were fewer percentage international normalized ratios ≥ 4 and ≤ 1.5 and serious adverse events at 3 months (4.5% versus 9.4% of patients, P < 0.001) with PG guidance.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that PG dosing should be considered for broader clinical application, a proposal that is being tested further in 3 major randomized trials. The simpler 1-step PG algorithm provided equivalent results and may be preferable for clinical application.

### Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113NHhBh]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

### Comparison of a single end point to determine optimal initial warfarin dosing (5 mg versus 10 mg) for venous thromboembolism [^111cWavH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

There remains considerable controversy regarding optimal initial warfarin dosing in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Therefore, an open-label, randomized trial comparing 2 warfarin initiation nomograms (5 vs 10 mg) was conducted in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. All participants received fondaparinux for ≥ 5 days as a "bridge" to warfarin. The primary end point was defined as the number of days necessary to achieve 2 consecutive international normalized ratio laboratory test values > 1.9. A total of 50 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to each of the treatment arms. The median time to 2 consecutive international normalized ratios was 5 days in the 2 groups. There was no statistical difference in achieving the primary end point using either the 5- or the 10-mg nomogram (p = 0.69). These results should provide clinicians with increased warfarin dosing options in patients presenting with acute venous thromboembolism.

### A randomized controlled trial of genotype-based coumadin initiation [^117RheWt]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients initiating warfarin to determine whether algorithms that incorporate genotypes affecting warfarin metabolism and function, and Vitamin K metabolism improve prediction of therapeutic warfarin dose and anticoagulation management.

Methods

A total of 230 patients were randomized to either a clinical arm where dosing algorithms considered only clinical information or an interventional arm where dosing algorithms used clinical and genotypic variables (CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and VKORC1). Subjects in the interventional arm were genotyped within 5 hours, and the initial dose was informed by genotype. Primary endpoints were absolute prediction error relative to therapeutic dose, and time in therapeutic target range during the first 14 days. Secondary endpoints included time to stable dose in therapeutic range, time to first international normalization ratio > 4, and warfarin-related adverse events.

Results

The model including genetics more accurately identified therapeutic dose twice as often as the clinical model (65.3% vs. 34.7%) (P < 0.0001). Patients in the interventional arm did not achieve greater time in therapeutic range. Study arms were similar regarding time to international normalization ratio > 4 and adverse events.

Conclusion

Genotype-informed dosing clearly improved prediction of therapeutic dose beyond that available with clinical parameters. Genetic information did not affect time in therapeutic target range during the first 14 days of therapy. Current management practices with the vagaries in dose adjustment after warfarin initiation exert a strong influence on traditional clinical outcomes.

### Initiating warfarin therapy: 5 mg versus 10 mg [^113YVQXz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature investigating initial dosing of warfarin at 5 or 10 mg for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-December 2003) using the key words warfarin, oral anticoagulation, warfarin dose, warfarin initiation, venous thromboembolism, and anticoagulation. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of the articles cited.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies of the initial dosing of warfarin at 5 or 10 mg were evaluated and relevant information was included, as were those that identified known factors that influence the maintenance dose of warfarin.

Data Synthesis

For the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, warfarin dosing is often provider dependent. Until recently, studies suggested that 5 mg initiation was as effective as 10 mg, without increasing the risk of bleeding. However, the most recent study comparing a 5- versus 10-mg initial dosing nomogram supports an initial dose of 10 mg. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, since patients at high risk for bleeding were excluded from the study. Several patient-specific factors will affect the maintenance dose, guiding clinicians to start with lower (< 5 mg) or higher (> 5 mg) doses.

Conclusions

Although recent evidence supports a 10-mg initiation nomogram, clinicians should consider patient-specific factors prior to deciding an initial warfarin dose. If a 10-mg loading dose is utilized, strict compliance with the protocol is necessary.

Oral anticoagulants

Warfarin

The coumarin-derived racemic mixture, warfarin, at peak usage was estimated to be taken by at least 1% of the whole UK population, and by 8% of those aged over 80 years. However, warfarin usage has decreased in many European countries and in the US, with a concomitant increase in the use of DOACs. Nevertheless, warfarin is still widely used especially in some of the lower-middle income countries, where affordability is a major issue.

Warfarin inhibits hepatic vitamin K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1). VKORC1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the warfarin sensitive vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylation system, and inhibition of VKORC1 reduces the production of functional clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, proteins C, S and Z, and leads to anticoagulation (Fig. 2). Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and large inter-individual variability with up to 20-fold difference in stable dose requirements between individuals. Therefore, warfarin treatment is closely monitored via the international normalised ratio (INR); for most indications, the recommended therapeutic INR range is 2.0–3.0. An overview of warfarin pharmacokinetics is provided in Table 2.

Patients with AF on warfarin are unsettlingly outside the therapeutic INR range 30–50% of the time. Importantly, bleeding is the most common warfarin ADR occurring in up to 41% of treated patients, with major bleeding frequencies as high as 10–16%. The risk of adverse events is highest during the initial dose-titration period within the first few weeks to months of warfarin therapy, and so strategies to individualise the initial warfarin doses have been sought.

### Optimal initial dose adjustment of warfarin in orthopedic patients [^111A5uai]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin sodium is commonly prescribed for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Dosing algorithms have not been widely adopted because they require a fixed initial warfarin dose (eg, 5 mg) and are not tailored to other factors that may affect the international normalized ratio (INR).

Objective

To develop an algorithm that could predict a therapeutic warfarin dose based on drug interactions, INR response after the initial warfarin doses, and other clinical factors.

Methods

We used stepwise regression to quantify the relationship between these factors in patients beginning prophylactic warfarin therapy immediately prior to joint replacement. In the derivation cohort (n = 271), we separately modeled the therapeutic dose after 2 and 3 initial doses. We prospectively validated these 2 models in an independent cohort (n = 105).

Results

About half of the therapeutic dose variability was predictable after 3 days of therapy: R² was 53% in the derivation cohort and 42% in the validation cohort. INR response after 3 warfarin doses (INR3) inversely correlated with therapeutic dose (p < 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss transiently, but significantly, elevated the postoperative INR values. Other significant (p < 0.03) predictors were the first and second warfarin doses (+7% and +6%, respectively, per 1 mg), and statin use (-15.0%). The model derived after 2 warfarin doses explained 32% of the variability in therapeutic dose.

Conclusions

We developed and validated algorithms that estimate therapeutic warfarin doses based on clinical factors and INR response available after 2–3 days of warfarin therapy. The algorithms are implemented online at www. WarfarinDosing.org.

Low-intensity VKA for patients with atrial fibrillation — For stroke prophylaxis, minidose or low-intensity fixed-dose VKA "usually corresponding to 1.25 mg (0.5–3 mg) warfarin daily" was studied; a meta-analysis of "four randomized trials with 2,753 patients" found minidose warfarin "was inferior to conventional-intensity VKA with regard to thrombotic events (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25–0.97)" and "Results were uncertain for major hemorrhage (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.67–2.27) or fatal bleeding (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.27–3.54)". Low-intensity VKA with a therapeutic range of "INR 1.5 to 2.0 (or 2.1 in one study)" was compared with conventional intensity in "two randomized trials" where one "was stopped prematurely after an excess of major hemorrhages" and neither showed differences in stroke or deaths; mean ages were "65 years" and "80 years". Pooled results show a "significant reduction of nonfatal extracranial hemorrhages with low-intensity VKA (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.6) without any appreciable increase in the rate of stroke or mortality". Stroke risk increases at low INR: "the OR for stroke was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.6–2.4) at an INR of 1.7 and 3.3 (95% CI, 2.4–4.6) at an INR of 1.5", and there is a trade-off showing a relative risk reduction of stroke "(~80%)" with "INR 1.5 to 2.0 compared with INR < 1.2", but greater thromboembolism risk with "INR 1.4 to 1.7 compared with INR 2.0 to 2.5 (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.67–5.19)" in the ATRIA cohort; notably, "there was no evidence for a reduced risk for intracranial hemorrhage at INR < 2.0 compared with 2.0 to 3.5".

### Recommendations for clinical warfarin genotyping allele selection: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^111LSgvG]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). High credibility.

Drug: Warfarin — mechanism, dosing target, and determinants of dose: Warfarin is administered orally as a racemic mixture of S-warfarin and R-warfarin and specifically inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, reducing activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index with concentration-dependent risks of bleeding or lack of efficacy. Clinically, dosing is tailored to the international normalized ratio with a target INR of 2 to 3 for most indications, and genetic variants along with age, body size, vitamin K intake, comorbidities, and concomitant medications contribute to warfarin sensitivity and dose requirements.

### Prediction of the warfarin maintenance dose after completion of the 10 mg initiation nomogram: do we really need genotyping? [^116e6EPy]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of warfarin therapy is complicated by its narrow therapeutic index and inter-patient dose-effect variability. A '10-mg nomogram' warfarin initiation protocol permits safe therapeutic anticoagulation in outpatients started on warfarin. We aimed to develop a safe and effective warfarin maintenance dose prediction tool in these patients.

Methods

Baseline potential predictor variables were collected on a retrospective cohort of outpatients initiated on warfarin for venous thromboembolism treatment. The primary outcome was the warfarin maintenance dose, defined as mean warfarin dose over the last 10 days of the first month of warfarin treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine which baseline variables were warfarin maintenance dose predictors. An independent cohort of patients validated the derived warfarin maintenance dose prediction rule.

Results

Patient's age and weight, cumulative dose of warfarin over the first week of induction and international normalized ratio (INR) on days 3, 5 and 8 were statistically significant predictors of the warfarin maintenance dose. Our final prediction rule reads: maintenance dose (in mg) = 2.5 + 10% of the first week cumulative dose - INR value at day 8 + 1.5 if INR was below 2.0 at day 5. In the validation cohort, the predicted dose was strongly correlated with the actual maintenance dose (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001). The mean difference between observed and predicted dose was not clinically significant: -0.1 ± 1.1 mg.

Conclusion

In outpatients initiated on warfarin using a '10-mg nomogram', a simple prediction rule can accurately predict warfarin maintenance dose. Prospective studies employing the rule are indicated.

### Warfarin dosing algorithms underpredict dose requirements in patients requiring ≥ 7 mg daily: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112byZbH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

There is preliminary evidence to suggest that some published warfarin dosing algorithms produce biased maintenance dose predictions in patients who require higher than average doses. We conducted a meta-analysis of warfarin dosing algorithms to determine if there exists a systematic under- or overprediction of dose requirements for patients requiring ≥ 7 mg/day across published algorithms. Medline and Embase databases were searched up to September 2015. We quantified the proportion of over- and underpredicted doses in patients whose observed maintenance dose was ≥ 7 mg/day. The meta-analysis included 47 evaluations of 22 different warfarin dosing algorithms from 16 studies. The meta-analysis included data from 1,492 patients who required warfarin doses of ≥ 7 mg/day. All 22 algorithms were found to underpredict warfarin dosing requirements in patients who required ≥ 7 mg/day by an average of 2.3 mg/day with a pooled estimate of underpredicted doses of 92.3% (95% confidence interval 90.3–94.1, I² = 24%).

### Warfarin maintenance dosing patterns in clinical practice: implications for safer anticoagulation in the elderly population [^1122G2GN]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of anticoagulant therapy is expanding among the elderly population, in part because of the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Published data describing the warfarin maintenance dose requirements for this age group are limited. Because warfarin therapy is often initiated in the outpatient setting where significant barriers to daily monitoring exist for this patient population, a better understanding of the factors that predict lower dose requirements may reduce the risk of unanticipated over-anticoagulation and hemorrhage.

Objective

To define the effects of age and gender on the warfarin maintenance dose among ambulatory adult patients with an international normalized ratio target between 2.0 and 3.0.

Design

Prospective cohort study and retrospective cohort secondary data source.

Setting

One hundred one community-based physician practices with dedicated warfarin management systems and an academic medical center anticoagulation clinic.

Patients

A total of 4,616 patients comprised the prospective cohort, and 7,586 patients comprised the retrospective cohort. Of the 12,202 patients, 2,359 were ≥ 80 years of age.

Measurements

Median weekly and daily maintenance warfarin dose.

Results

The warfarin dose was inversely related to age and was strongly associated with gender. The median weekly dose ranged from 45 mg (6.4 mg/d) for men who were < 50 years of age to 22 mg (3.1 mg/d) for women ≥ 80 years of age. The weekly dose declined by 0.4 mg/yr (95% confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.44; p < 0.001) and women required 4.5 mg less per week than men (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.3; p < 0.001). Among patients who were > 70 years of age, the often-suggested initiation dose of 5 mg/d will be excessive for 82% of women and 65% of men.

Conclusions

Warfarin dose requirements decrease greatly with age. Older women require the lowest warfarin doses. These observations suggest that, when warfarin is being initiated, the commonly employed empiric starting dose of 5 mg/d will lead to over-anticoagulation for the majority of patients in the geriatric age group; lower initiation and maintenance doses should be considered for the elderly.

### New oral anticoagulants: which one should my patient use? [^113GEt11]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin. Focusing on these features, this paper (a) compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin (b) identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features, (c) reviews their current indications, and (d) uses this information to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

Warfarin loading strategies in randomized trials — two studies compared a 10-mg loading dose to 5 mg daily for the first 2 days, with one not reporting recurrent VTE; concentrations of protein C and factor VII decreased faster in the 10-mg group than in the 5-mg group, but increased recurrent thromboembolism has not been demonstrated. In a trial of 5 vs 10 mg initial dosing in 190 patients there was no difference in median time to two consecutive therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs), with a 2-week follow-up and exclusion of 322 of 372 screened. Another study showed a shorter time to a therapeutic INR with loading dose vs standard initiation (3.3 vs 4.3 days). A 10- vs 5-mg initiation nomogram in 210 outpatients yielded a shorter mean time to therapeutic INR of 4.2 vs 5.6 days and a higher proportion therapeutic by day 5 of 86% vs 45%, and all studies followed the initiation period with INR-based dose adjustment.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1174t4EA]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### A randomized trial of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin [^111S5e2M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

The level of anticoagulation in response to a fixed-dose regimen of warfarin is difficult to predict during the initiation of therapy. We prospectively compared the effect of genotype-guided dosing with that of standard dosing on anticoagulation control in patients starting warfarin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Genotyping for CYP2C9✱2, CYP2C9✱3, and VKORC1 (-1639G→A) was performed with the use of a point-of-care test. For patients assigned to the genotype-guided group, warfarin doses were prescribed according to pharmacogenetic-based algorithms for the first 5 days. Patients in the control (standard dosing) group received a 3-day loading-dose regimen. After the initiation period, the treatment of all patients was managed according to routine clinical practice. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of time in the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0 for the international normalized ratio (INR) during the first 12 weeks after warfarin initiation.

Results

A total of 455 patients were recruited, with 227 randomly assigned to the genotype-guided group and 228 assigned to the control group. The mean percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 67.4% in the genotype-guided group as compared with 60.3% in the control group (adjusted difference, 7.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 10.6; P < 0.001). There were significantly fewer incidences of excessive anticoagulation (INR ≥ 4.0) in the genotype-guided group. The median time to reach a therapeutic INR was 21 days in the genotype-guided group as compared with 29 days in the control group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Pharmacogenetic-based dosing was associated with a higher percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range than was standard dosing during the initiation of warfarin therapy. (Funded by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01119300.).

### The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115mGq71]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at ≤ 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+).

### Pharmacogenetics-based coumarin therapy [^1127rixV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

To reduce the risk of hemorrhage, experts advocate prescribing the anticipated therapeutic dose to patients who are beginning coumarin therapy, but until now there was no accurate way to estimate that dose. Using pharmacogenetics-based coumarin therapy, clinicians can now estimate the therapeutic dose by genotyping their patients for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect coumarin metabolism or sensitivity. SNPs in the cytochrome P450 complex (CYP2C9) affect coumarin metabolism. Patients with either of two common variants, CYP2C9✱2 or CYP2C9✱3, metabolize coumarins slowly and are twice as likely to have a laboratory or clinical adverse event, unless their initial coumarin doses are reduced. SNPs in vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) correlate with coumarin sensitivity. Patients known to be homozygous for a common VKORC1 promoter polymorphism, -1639 G > A (also designated as VKOR 3673, haplotype A, or haplotype*2), should be started on lower coumarin doses than genotype GG patients. By providing an estimate of the therapeutic coumarin dose, pharmacogenetics-based therapy may improve the safety and effectiveness of coumarin therapy.

Warfarin pharmacogenetics — dose prediction and adverse events: In a validation cohort of > 1,000 patients, a pharmacogenetic algorithm more accurately identified patients who required ≤ 21 mg weekly warfarin doses and those who required weekly doses of ≥ 49 mg compared with a clinical algorithm, with no difference for intermediate doses. Observational data reported that among 185 patients, 58 with at least one CYP2C9 variant had higher risk of INRs above range (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03–1.90) and serious or life-threatening bleeding (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.15–4.86); other studies noted a trend toward increased rates of an INR > 6.0 and bleeding in heterozygotes or compound heterozygotes/homozygotes. A randomized trial found that a pharmacogenetic-based dosing strategy did not significantly reduce adverse events (34.7% vs 42.4%; OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.41–1.25).

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

### Warfarin dose assessment every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks in patients with stable international normalized ratios: a randomized trial [^113YjVYh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients receiving warfarin undergo international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring every 4 weeks.

Objective

To investigate whether assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks is as safe as assessment every 4 weeks.

Design

Noninferiority randomized trial. The randomization schedule (in a 1:1 ratio) was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until the database was locked by using a centralized schedule. Patients, study and clinical personnel, adjudicators of clinical events, and the study statistician were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00356759) SETTING: Single center in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Patients

250 patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, whose dose was unchanged for at least 6 months; 226 completed the study.

Intervention

Dosing assessment every 12 weeks (n = 124) compared with every 4 weeks (n = 126) for 12 months. Patients in the 12-week group were tested every 4 weeks; sham INRs within the target range were reported for two of the three 4-week periods.

Measurements

Percentage of time in the therapeutic range (primary outcome) and number of extreme INRs, changes in maintenance dose, major bleeding events, objectively verified thromboembolism, and death (secondary outcomes).

Results

The percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 74.1% (SD, 18.8%) in the 4-week group compared with 71.6% (SD, 20.0%) in the 12-week group (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [1-sided 97.5% upper confidence bound, 7.3 percentage points]; noninferiority P = 0.020 for a 7.5-percentage point margin). Fewer patients in the 12-week group than in the 4-week group had any dose changes (37.1% vs. 55.6%; absolute difference, 18.5 percentage points [95% CI, 6.1 to 30.0 percentage points]; P = 0.004). Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups.

Limitations

Patients in the 12-week group had testing and contact with clinic staff every 4 weeks. The study was conducted at a single center and used surrogate outcomes.

Conclusion

Assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks seems to be safe and noninferior to assessment every 4 weeks. A comparison of INR testing, patient contact, and warfarin dose assessment every 12 weeks versus every 4 weeks is necessary before INR testing every 12 weeks can be routinely recommended for practice.

### Vitamin K antagonists – current concepts and challenges [^1139KZCD]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagtonists (VKAs) have, for decades, been the corner-stone of anticoagulation in the outpatient setting. While the long half life makes once daily administration practical, close monitoring of VKA effect is necessary because these medicines have a narrow therapeutic index. Despite inter-individual variations in response to VKA doses, the increasing availability of specialized anticoagulation monitoring systems, along with a better understanding of potential drug and dietary interactions, has made the use of VKAs safer and less burdensome. In the future, newer classes of oral anticoagulants and genomic-based dosing strategies may further expand or improve the management options for many patients at risk for thromboembolism.

### Warfarin dosing in patients with CYP2C9✱5 variant alleles [^113mkd2f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Pharmacogenetic dosing improves the accuracy of warfarin dosing, but current pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms are less accurate in populations of African ancestry. The cytochrome P450 2C9*5 (CYP2C9✱5) allele is found almost exclusively in populations of African ancestry, and in vitro studies suggest CYP2C9✱5 is associated with reduced clearance of warfarin. The clinical relevance of this single-nucleotide variation (SNV) (formerly SNP) is uncertain. In this multicentered study of 2,298 patients (49% female, 35% Black) taking warfarin, we quantified the association between the CYP2C9✱5 allele and warfarin requirements. The CYP2C9✱5 SNV was present in 2.3% of Black and 0.07% of White patients. Without taking CYP2C9✱5 into account, pharmacogenetic algorithms that include other SNVs overestimated the warfarin dose by 30% (95% confidence interval (19–40%), P < 0.001), an average of 1.87 mg/day (SD 1.64) in heterozygotes (P < 0.001). Noncarriers required a slightly (0.23 mg/day, SD 2.09) higher than predicted dose. Genotyping for CYP2C9✱5 corrected the potential overdose and halved overall dosing error in heterozygotes. Patients carrying CYP2C9✱5 require a clinically relevant reduction in warfarin dose. Given the potential to improve the accuracy and safety of warfarin dosing in populations of African ancestry, we have incorporated this SNV into a nonprofit website to assist warfarin initiation (www. WarfarinDosing.org).

### Optimizing use of current anticoagulants [^113JMyLa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although warfarin has been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation therapy for decades, evidence-based methods for improving the quality of warfarin therapy remain underused. The arrival of new anticoagulants that do not require routine laboratory monitoring and lack the significant dietary and drug interaction potential that are seen with warfarin is an important evolutionary step in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, it will be years before the efficacy and long-term safety of these new agents are defined. Newer oral anticoagulants will be more expensive than generic warfarin. This article examines various approaches to optimize the clinical use of warfarin. For patients able to achieve stable anticoagulation control, warfarin remains an important therapeutic option, delivering similar clinical outcomes at a fraction of the cost to the health care system.

### Long-term anticoagulation: the prospects for alternatives to warfarin [^115SP2aA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Many advances have occurred in the pharmacological treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) since the vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) and unfractionated heparin were introduced over 60 years ago, but warfarin and other coumarin derivatives remain the only orally administered anticoagulants available for long-term prevention and treatment of VTE. The coumarin derivatives are not convenient to use, as they have a narrow therapeutic index and require frequent laboratory monitoring and dosage adjustment. The low-molecular-weight heparins, and the indirect factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, offer improvements, but both agents still need to be administered subcutaneously. A number of new, orally available, direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin are in development and offer ease of use and predictability of dosing so that monitoring is not required. These agents hold great promise as new anticoagulants that might provide greater efficacy and safety, and because of these attributes, might lead to greater use of anticoagulant therapy for patients not currently treated.

### Substituting warfarin products: what's the source of the problem? [^116PN4FE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Many clinicians have expressed concerns about the bioequivalence of warfarin products, and data suggest that substituting warfarin products may increase the risk of major bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Anecdotal reports and some retrospective studies have reported differences in anticoagulation control after a warfarin product substitution. But the best available evidence-prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trials-has failed to validate these observations. Indeed, interpatient and intrapatient variability in anticoagulation control observed before and after warfarin product substitution is very similar. So, while differences in product standardization, bioavailability, and bioequivalence make a convenient explanation, the problem lies elsewhere. Perhaps poor communication, fractionated systems of care, and errors are the culprits.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116eWgBY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) reversal — Several options exist for reversal of VKAs, including administration of vitamin K, PCCs, and plasma; vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, and slow intravenous administration (in 25 to 50 mL normal saline over 15 to 30 minutes) effects a more predictable and rapid reduction in the INR (4 to 6 hours) compared with oral (18 to 24 hours), although the administration of vitamin K does not result in immediate correction of coagulopathy and for a major bleed warranting reversal must be accompanied by a repletion strategy (if 4F-PCC is unavailable, PCCs or plasma may be used). PCCs contain purified vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; nonactivated 3-factor PCCs contain FII, FIX, and FX with negligible FVII, protein C, and S, whereas nonactivated 4F-PCCs contain FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and proteins C and S, and only 4F-PCCs are licensed for rapid VKA reversal. For VKA reversal, 4F-PCCs are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight (INR 2 to < 4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4 to 6 at 35 U/kg, and INR > 6 at 50 U/kg; max dose 5,000 units capped at 100 kg body weight), and per unit volume 4F-PCCs contain approximately 25 times (25 U/mL) the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors as compared with plasma (1 U/mL); therefore, PCC can be given in a much smaller volume at a much faster infusion rate (8×) compared with plasma and is preferred.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114Y8EyQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative warfarin (VKA) restart dose — PICO 3: In patients requiring VKA (warfarin) interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming the first post-operative VKA dose at the patient's usual dose over resuming VKA with double the usual dose (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). One randomized trial of 98 patients compared post-operative resumption of warfarin at patients' usual dose vs doubling the warfarin dose for the first 2 post-operative days, finding by the fifth post-operative day an INR ≥ 2.0 in 13% of the usual-dose group and 50% of the doubling dose group (RR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60) and by the tenth post-operative day 68% and 87% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.00). A 40-patient randomized trial reported median days to reach an INR ≥ 2.0 of 7.8 vs 9.0 days (95% CI: −3.1 to 4.9), and observational studies reported mean durations to attain an INR ≥ 2.0 of 4.6 and 5.1 days, respectively. Implementation notes caution that although doubling for 1 to 2 days may lead to a more rapid attainment of an INR ≥ 2.0 in some patients, there are concerns in applying this approach in practice, including in patients expected to be hospitalized for > 1 day.

### Comparison of a daily fixed 2.5-mg warfarin dose with a 5-mg, international normalized ratio adjusted, warfarin dose initially following heart valve replacement [^117DXKtn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients starting oral anticoagulant therapy after heart valve replacement initially require a lower target international normalized ratio (INR) (2.0, range 1.5 to 2.6) because of a higher risk of bleeding until pericardial wires are removed. In a previous retrospective analysis, we observed a higher sensitivity to warfarin in these patients compared with nonsurgical patients. In a randomized clinical trial, we compared a fixed, lower dose of warfarin (2.5 mg) with the standard treatment consisting of a 5-mg loading dose, then adjusted to the target INR during the first 5 days of anticoagulation. INRs were measured daily, but the fixed dose was only modified on day 3 if the INR was < 1.5 or > 3.0. One hundred ninety-seven patients were considered eligible for the study. The 2 groups were well matched according to age, gender, body mass index, concomitant treatments, and type of valves implanted. The proportion of INRs > 2.6 during the study period was 42.5% in the 5-mg group and 26.2% in the 2.5-mg group (p < 0.05), and the proportion of INRs > 3.0 on day 3 was 23.9% and 9.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. In the 2.5-mg group, 35.7% of patients had an INR < 1.5 on day 3 and had the dose increased (vs 3.5%, p < 0.001); however, in the 5-mg group, 95.6% had the initial dose reduced, 49.6% had the dose withheld for at least 1 day, and the mean dose during the 5 days of study was 3.08 mg. Average time to achieve therapeutic range was higher in the 2.5-mg group (2.72 vs 1.98 days, p < 0.0001), but the approach to the targeted INR was more regular, and the gap between target and mean INR on day 5 was smaller. There were no bleeding or thromboembolic complications in either group. Thus, a lower loading dose of warfarin in patients after heart valve replacement reduces excessive anticoagulation and offers a more regular achievement of the therapeutic target by reducing the number of dose adjustments. Daily monitoring of the INR is still recommended.

### Genotype-guided versus traditional clinical dosing of warfarin in patients of Asian ancestry: a randomized controlled trial [^112EJBL1]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial that included 322 adults of South East Asian ancestry, genotype-guided dosing reduced the number of dose titrations during the first 2 weeks compared to traditional dosing (1.77 vs. 2.93) while maintaining similar INR time within therapeutic ranges. The reduction in frequency of dose revisions persisted over the 90-day follow-up period (incidence rate ratio 0.76). The genotype-guided algorithm also accurately predicted maintenance dose requirements. These findings imply that clinicians treating Asian patients may consider applying a pharmacogenetic algorithm to personalize initial warfarin dosages.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112mEboq]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Mechanical On-X aortic valve — lower-intensity warfarin strategy: In patients without risk factors who receive a mechanical On-X aortic heart valve, targeting the INR to a lower goal (1.5–2.0) with aspirin 81 mg daily may be a strategy for long-term management. Warfarin dosing is targeted to an INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) for the first 3 months after surgery, during which low-dose aspirin is also used. In the randomized comparison, the lower-intensity INR group experienced significantly less major and minor bleeding with similar rates of stroke, transient ischemic attack, total neurological events, and all-cause mortality between the 2 groups, and a subsequent publication showed harm with dual-antiplatelet therapy versus low-intensity anticoagulation plus low-dose aspirin.

Warfarin clinical modifiers — several conditions and exposures influence responsiveness and dosing; "Hepatic dysfunction potentiates the response to warfarin", and such patients may appear "auto-anticoagulated" with elevated INRs that are "not sufficient to prevent thromboembolism". "Hypermetabolic states" from fever or hyperthyroidism "increase warfarin responsiveness", while cigarette smoke components "may induce CYP1A2", with warfarin dose requirements "observed to decline after smoking cessation". Chewing tobacco "contains high quantities of vitamin K that can increase warfarin dose requirements", heart failure exacerbations "can increase responsiveness", and end-stage renal disease with reduced "CYP2C9" activity leads to "lower warfarin dosing requirements". With advanced age, "Warfarin dosing requirements decline", and "age may be the single most important easily obtained predictor of warfarin dosing requirement".

### Evaluating within-subject variability for narrow therapeutic index drugs [^116csR3X]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach scales the bioequivalence (BE) limits of narrow therapeutic index drugs (NTIDs) to the intrasubject or within-subject variability (WSV) of the reference-listed drug. A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the WSV of warfarin (Coumadin), 10 mg, administered to 10 healthy volunteers exhibiting similar cytochrome P450 2C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase alleles on 3 study days. Individual intrasubject coefficients of variation for maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve (0–72 hour) ranged from 3.7–15% and from 4.3–16.2%, respectively (R-warfarin) and from 5.4–19.1% and from 2.5–11.9%, respectively (S-warfarin). Two BE tests were performed on a WSV distribution obtained by bootstrapping 1,000 replicates of the clinical data, yielding passing rates of 95–97% for the mean comparison and 84–87% for the variability comparison. The variability comparison passing rate was lower than expected for an NTID product tested against itself, but it may provide further assurance of BE.

Edoxaban — atrial fibrillation (AF) dose strategy and bleeding outcomes — was compared with warfarin in a phase 2 trial of 1,146 patients; the composite of major plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was higher with 30 or 60 mg bid than with warfarin (7.5%, 10.6%, and 3.2%, respectively), whereas once-daily 30 or 60 mg had rates similar to warfarin (3.0% and 3.8%). Based on these data, the phase 3 double-blind ENGAGE-AF-TIMI 48 trial compares 30 or 60 mg once daily (with dose adjustments for drug clearance) with warfarin (dose adjusted to achieve a target INR of 2–3), with enrollment completed and follow-up ongoing in this event-driven trial.

### Assessment of the efficacy of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen in lowering the international normalised ratio in over-anticoagulated patients: a randomised clinical trial [^115YLxsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines advocate using fixed-doses of oral vitamin K to reverse excessive anticoagulation in warfarinised patients who are either asymptomatic or have minor bleeds. Over-anticoagulated patients present with a wide range of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values and response to fixed doses of vitamin K varies. Consequently a significant proportion of patients remain outside their target INR after vitamin K administration, making them prone to either haemorrhage or thromboembolism. We compared the performance of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen to that of a fixed-dose regimen with the primary measure being the proportion of over-anticoagulated patients returning to their target INR within 24 h. One hundred and eighty-one patients with an index INR > 6.0 (asymptomatic or with minor bleeding) were randomly allocated to receive oral administration of either a tailored dose (based upon index INR and body surface area) or a fixed-dose (1 or 2 mg) of vitamin K. A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68.9% vs. 52.8%; P = 0.026), whilst a smaller proportion of patients remained above target INR range (12.2% vs. 34.0%; P < 0.001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.

### Genotype-guided versus traditional clinical dosing of warfarin in patients of Asian ancestry: a randomized controlled trial [^115dGPve]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Genotype-guided warfarin dosing has been shown in some randomized trials to improve anticoagulation outcomes in individuals of European ancestry, yet its utility in Asian patients remains unresolved.

Methods

An open-label, non-inferiority, 1:1 randomized trial was conducted at three academic hospitals in South East Asia, involving 322 ethnically diverse patients newly indicated for warfarin (NCT00700895). Clinical follow-up was 90 days. The primary efficacy measure was the number of dose titrations within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with a mean non-inferiority margin of 0.5 over the first 14 days of therapy.

Results

Among 322 randomized patients, 269 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Compared with traditional dosing, the genotype-guided group required fewer dose titrations during the first 2 weeks (1.77 vs. 2.93, difference −1.16, 90% CI −1.48 to −0.84, P < 0.001 for both non-inferiority and superiority). The percentage of time within the therapeutic range over 3 months and median time to stable international normalized ratio (INR) did not differ between the genotype-guided and traditional dosing groups. The frequency of dose titrations (incidence rate ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, P = 0.001), but not frequency of INR measurements, was lower at 1, 2, and 3 months in the genotype-guided group. The proportions of patients who experienced minor or major bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, or out-of-range INR did not differ between both arms. For predicting maintenance doses, the pharmacogenetic algorithm achieved an R² = 42.4% (P < 0.001) and mean percentage error of −7.4%.

Conclusions

Among Asian adults commencing warfarin therapy, a pharmacogenetic algorithm meets criteria for both non-inferiority and superiority in reducing dose titrations compared with a traditional dosing approach, and performs well in prediction of actual maintenance doses. These findings imply that clinicians may consider applying a pharmacogenetic algorithm to personalize initial warfarin dosages in Asian patients.

### Argatroban [^116nWeuj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Conversion to Oral Anticoagulant Therapy

Initiating Oral Anticoagulant Therapy

When converting patients from argatroban to oral anticoagulant therapy, consider the potential for combined effects on INR with co-administration of argatroban and warfarin. A loading dose of warfarin should not be used. Initiate therapy using the expected daily dose of warfarin. To avoid prothrombotic effects and to ensure continuous anticoagulation when initiating warfarin, it is suggested that Argatroban and warfarin therapy be overlapped. There are insufficient data available to recommend the duration of the overlap.

Co-Administration of Warfarin and Argatroban Injection at Doses up to 2 mcg/kg/min

Measure INR daily while Argatroban Injection and warfarin are co-administered. In general, with doses of Argatroban Injection up to 2 mcg/kg/min, Argatroban Injection can be discontinued when the INR is > 4 on combined therapy. After Argatroban Injection is discontinued, repeat the INR measurement in 4 to 6 hours. If the repeat INR is below the desired therapeutic range, resume the infusion of Argatroban Injection and repeat the procedure daily until the desired therapeutic range on warfarin alone is reached.

Co-Administration of Warfarin and Argatroban Injection at Doses Greater than 2 mcg/kg/min

For doses of argatroban greater than 2 mcg/kg/min, the relationship of INR between warfarin alone to the INR on warfarin plus argatroban is less predictable. In this case, in order to predict the INR on warfarin alone, temporarily reduce the dose of Argatroban Injection to a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min. Repeat the INR on Argatroban Injection and warfarin 4 to 6 hours after reduction of the Argatroban Injection dose and follow the process outlined above for administering Argatroban Injection at doses up to 2 mcg/kg/min.

### The frequency and effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 polymorphisms in patients receiving warfarin [^113CnaTi]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin sodium (warfarin) is commonly prescribed in surgical practice. Warfarin use is complicated by an unpredictable dose response that may be due in part to genetically determined differences in metabolic capacity. To better understand the interaction between genotype and response to warfarin therapy, we determined the frequency and functional effects of polymorphisms of the predominant cytochrome P450 subfamily responsible for warfarin metabolism (eg, CYP2C9) in an ethnically defined U.S. patient population.

Design

Patients requiring chronic anticoagulation with warfarin sodium (warfarin) were recruited over an 11-month period (June 1999 through May 2000) from the inpatient and outpatient divisions of a tertiary care medical center in this prospective observational study. Clinical and demographic information was collected and CYP2C9 genotype was determined.

Results

One hundred fifty-three patients receiving warfarin therapy for at least four weeks and comprising two ethnic groups [33 African Americans (22%) and 120 Caucasians (78%)] were genotyped. The mean weekly warfarin dose (± SEM) for all patients [36.9 (± 1.5) mg] was not influenced by gender [85 males (56%), 68 females (44%)] or ethnicity (p > 0.05 for both), but was significantly affected by age (p = 0.006 for weight adjusted warfarin dose). The frequencies of CYP polymorphisms were as follows: 2C9*2 (24/153) 15.7%, 2C9*3 (23/153) 15.0%. There were no gender differences in polymorphism frequency (CYP2C9✱2 frequency = (13/ 85) 15.3% in males, (12/68) 17.6% in females, p = 0.74; CYP2C9✱3 frequency = (15/85) 17.6% in males and (8/68) 11.8% in females, p = 0.38). CYP polymorphisms were much less common in African Americans than Caucasians [(5/33) 15.2% versus (47/120) 39.2%, respectively p = 0.05)]. Patients with CYP polymorphisms (2C9*2, 2C9*3) had significantly lower warfarin doses compared to patients with wild-type genotypes [30.6 (± 2.5) mg versus 40.1 (± 1.7) mg, p = 0.0021]. Stepwise backward regression analysis suggested a moderate ability to predict warfarin dose based on CYP genotype (r² = 0.26), p < 0.01).

Conclusions

CYP2C9 polymorphisms are common, associated with significant reductions in warfarin dose, and partly account for interpatient variability in warfarin sensitivity. As interactions between genetic factors and other variables that influence warfarin effect are more completely understood, CYP analysis may prove a useful adjunct for increasing the safety and efficacy of this agent.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension — vitamin K antagonists (coumadin, warfarin, phenprocoumon) are used for oral anticoagulation in patients with a history of thrombosis, hypercoagulation, central lines, and some PH centres use coumadin or warfarin in paediatric IPAH or HPAH; dosing targets are stated as "Goal INRs in the range of (1.5-) 2.0–2.5 are usually chosen for this indication" with possible need for higher INR for history of thrombosis or hypercoagulability, benefits are prevention thrombosis and thromboembolic events, risks include that "The risk of anticoagulation in paediatrics must be balanced with the hypothetical benefits", and recommendations are given as "For IPAH/HPAH: COR IIb LOE C" and "For APAH-CHD: COR IIb LOE C".

### Genotype-guided versus traditional clinical dosing of warfarin in patients of Asian ancestry: a randomized controlled trial [^116uqsYw]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of dose titrations performed up to end of week 2 (day 14). Patients censored prior to day 14 were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat set due to insufficient data on dose titrations, INR, and other anticoagulation parameters for the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints.

Secondary outcomes were time to stable INR, defined as the number of days from warfarin initiation to attaining therapeutic INR (≥ 1.9 and ≤ 3.1) for the latter of two consecutive measurements that are at least 7 days apart; percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range (PTTR), which was estimated using the linear interpolation method of Rosendaal et al; incidence of dose adjustments and INR monitoring during follow-up; and the proportions of patients who had a bleeding episode (classified as minor or major), recurrent venous thromboembolism, and any measured INR value < 1.9 or > 3.1. The PTTR was included in June 2016 as a secondary outcome by way of protocol amendment following a meeting with the Scientific Review Committee for the Surveillance and Pharmacogenomics Initiative for Adverse Drug Reactions (SAPhIRE) program, who recommended that reporting of this endpoint would facilitate between-trial comparisons and enable meta-analyses of similar trials.

Statistical analysis

The trial was powered to establish whether genotype-guided warfarin dose administration was non-inferior to traditional clinical dosing for the primary endpoint of number of dose titrations within the first 2 weeks of therapy. Based on previous data, the sample size was estimated assuming a conservative between-group mean difference of 1.0 and a common standard deviation of 1.4 dose titrations. Therefore, with 80% power and a one-sided type I error of 5%, a sample size of 270 would be able to demonstrate non-inferiority of the genotype-guided group for a predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.5 dose titrations. Assuming up to 15% loss to follow-up before day 14, a minimum of 320 patients was deemed necessary. If the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in treatment (genotype-guided vs. traditional dosing) was lesser than 0.5, the null hypothesis would be rejected, which would signify that the genotype-guided strategy was non-inferior to the traditional dosing approach. When non-inferiority was proven, a two-tailed t test with an alpha value of 0.05 was used for superiority testing.

Warfarin — pharmacokinetics and enantiomer-specific metabolism: Warfarin is a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers, reaches maximal blood concentrations about 90 min after oral administration, and racemic warfarin has a half-life of 36 to 42 h (R-warfarin 45 h, S-warfarin 29 h); the S enantiomer is 2.7–3.8 times more potent than the R enantiomer and undergoes approximately 90% oxidative metabolism primarily by CYP2C9 with lesser CYP3A4 involvement, whereas the R enantiomer undergoes approximately 60% oxidative metabolism primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 with lesser CYP2C19 involvement.

### Effectiveness and safety of reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: propensity weighted nationwide cohort study [^113RGj1K]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Perspectives to randomised trial data

In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, 831 patients received apixaban 2.5 mg (with 428 patients initially randomised to this dose at baseline) based on at least two of age ≥ 80, bodyweight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 132.6 μmol/L. In a post hoc analysis on the ARISTOTLE trial data, 790 patients were treated with either apixaban 2.5 mg or warfarin; all were aged ≥ 75, but no additional information on indication for dose reduction or distribution of patients was given. In this subgroup of patients, the outcome of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism occurred at a lower rate in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.08). As no information on dose reduction was provided, direct comparisons with the results in the current study would be challenging. Even so, in the subgroup of patients with an indication for dose reduction (age ≥ 80 and/or renal dysfunction) we observed a higher rate of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban 2.5 mg compared with warfarin (1.24, 1.00 to 1.55). Whether this discrepancy between post hoc trial analysis and data from routing care can be related to inappropriate prescribing patterns of apixaban 2.5 mg in clinical practice remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, in healthy people (with normal renal function and lower age) apixaban 2.5 mg was associated with about 50% lower plasma concentrations than treatment with 5.0 mg. Our observational data might raise the question of whether a 50% dose reduction is excessive or appropriate in patients aged ≥ 80 and/or with impaired renal function to maintain effective stroke prevention. Clearly, this hypothesis warrants further research.

### Management strategies following slightly out-of-range INRs: watchful waiting vs dose changes [^112gZ2wc]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Higher time in therapeutic range is a predictor of positive outcomes such as decreased risk of death, stroke, and major bleeding events. However, time in therapeutic range has been shown to be affected by a multitude of factors including adherence to regimen, diet, patient demographics, and comorbidities. Most of these factors lie outside the realm of adjustment, and clinicians must rely primarily on dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs).

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend a therapeutic INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 for most indications for warfarin, including atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and low-risk mechanical aortic valve replacement. At any given time, 50% of patients receiving care within an anticoagulation management clinic may be outside of the recommended range, with 30% only slightly out of range (1.75–1.99 or 2.01–2.25). When an INR is found to be slightly out of range, clinicians must select a management strategy to reestablish a therapeutic INR. Warfarin management strategies include a weekly dose change and/or a single-dose change or no dose change. In cases where the INR is slightly out of range, 0.5 above or below the therapeutic range, ACCP guidelines suggest maintaining the patient's current warfarin dosing and retesting the INR within the following 2 weeks. This management strategy is also known as watchful waiting.

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

### INR response to low-dose vitamin K in warfarin patients [^113ASnFW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Literature suggests that 2 mg of vitamin K intravenously (IV) provides a similar effect as 10 mg to reverse warfarin. Doses < 5 mg haven't been studied in depth.

Objective

The objective was to determine the international normalized ratio (INR) reduction effect of ultra low-dose (ULD) IV vitamin K.

Methods

This retrospective, observational cohort study compared IV vitamin K doses of 0.25–0.5 mg (ULD) versus 1–2 mg (standard low dose [SLD]). The primary outcome assessed ΔINR at 36 hours; secondary outcomes assessed ΔINR at 12 hours and 30-day venous thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality rates.

Results

Of 88 patients identified (median baseline INR [IQR], 5.1 [3.1, 7.3] vs 4.5 [2.8, 8.2], ULD vs SLD, respectively), 59 had an INR at 12 hours. The ULD had fewer 12-hour INR values < 2, with no statistical difference in the ΔINR at 12 hours between the ULD and SLD cohorts (median ΔINR, 2.2 [1.1, 3.4] vs 2.2 [1.1, 6.3]; P = 0.54; median INR, 2.3 vs 1.8). A total of 41 patients had both a 12- and 36-hour INR. No significant difference in the ΔINR between the 12- and 36-hour values occurred (median ΔINR, 0.52 [0.2, 0.91] vs ΔINR, 0.46 [0.18, 0.55]; P = 0.61), suggesting no rebound or excessive reversal and no difference in 30-day rates of VTE (P > 0.99) or death (P = 0.38).

Conclusion and Relevance

ULD IV vitamin K reversed INR similarly to doses of 1–2 mg without rebound. A ULD strategy may be considered in patients requiring more cautious reversal.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^115Uwarb]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon) — pediatric VTE therapeutic range, monitoring, and initial dosing are outlined as follows. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0), and high‑risk conditions may require 2.5 to 3.5. Infants and small children require very regular INR tests (on average, 2 tests per week) compared with once‑a‑month testing in most adults, and the peak anticoagulation effect is not reached until 5 to 7 days after initiation. Younger children require higher dosing per kilogram than older children. For warfarin, the initial loading dose is 0.2 mg/kg per day, with a maximum of 10 mg per dose when the INR goal is between 2.0 and 3.0; after a Fontan procedure or with liver dysfunction, the initial loading dose should be 0.1 mg/kg per dose. For acenocoumarol, the starting dose ranges from 0.20 mg/kg to 0.06 mg/kg, dependent on age, and the gold‑standard test for monitoring warfarin therapy is the INR. The anticoagulant effects of VKA may be decreased if taken with food rich in vitamin K, and vitamin E and cranberry juice may increase warfarin effect.

### Randomized trial of genotype-guided versus standard warfarin dosing in patients initiating oral anticoagulation [^116x3p7m]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of warfarin is a promising application of "personalized medicine" but has not been adequately tested in randomized trials.

Methods and Results

Consenting patients (n = 206) being initiated on warfarin were randomized to pharmacogenetic-guided or standard dosing. Buccal swab DNA was genotyped for CYP2C9 *2 and CYP2C9 *3 and VKORC1C1173T with a rapid assay. Standard dosing followed an empirical protocol, whereas pharmacogenetic-guided dosing followed a regression equation including the 3 genetic variants and age, sex, and weight. Prothrombin time international normalized ratio (INR) was measured routinely on days 0, 3, 5, 8, 21, 60, and 90. A research pharmacist unblinded to treatment strategy managed dose adjustments. Patients were followed up for up to 3 months. Pharmacogenetic-guided predicted doses more accurately approximated stable doses (P < 0.001), resulting in smaller (P = 0.002) and fewer (P = 0.03) dosing changes and INRs (P = 0.06). However, percent out-of-range INRs (pharmacogenetic = 30.7%, standard = 33.1%), the primary end point, did not differ significantly between arms. Despite this, when restricted to wild-type patients (who required larger doses; P = 0.001) and multiple variant carriers (who required smaller doses; P < 0.001) in exploratory analyses, results (pharmacogenetic = 29%, standard = 39%) achieved nominal significance (P = 0.03). Multiple variant allele carriers were at increased risk of an INR of ≥ 4 (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

An algorithm guided by pharmacogenetic and clinical factors improved the accuracy and efficiency of warfarin dose initiation. Despite this, the primary end point of a reduction in out-of-range INRs was not achieved. In subset analyses, pharmacogenetic guidance showed promise for wild-type and multiple variant genotypes.

### A novel long-acting synthetic factor Xa inhibitor (sanOrg34006) to replace warfarin for secondary prevention in deep vein thrombosis. A phase II evaluation [^114boNCd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists for secondary prevention in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) require monitoring and dose adjustments. The synthetic factor Xa inhibitor, SanOrg34006, has predictable pharmacokinetics and may be administered once weekly without dose adjustments.

Methods

After 5–7 days of enoxaparin treatment, patients with proximal DVT were randomized to receive 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 or 10 mg of SanOrg34006 subcutaneously once weekly or warfarin (INR, 2.0–3.0) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of change in thrombotic burden, as assessed by ultrasonography and perfusion lung scanning at baseline and week 12 ± 1, and clinical thromboembolic events. This outcome was classified as normalization, no relevant change, or deterioration. Other outcomes were major and other clinically relevant bleeding.

Results

A total of 659 patients were randomized and treated. In 614 (93%) patients the primary efficacy outcome was evaluable. The rates of normalization and deterioration were similar in all SanOrg34006 groups (P = 0.4) and did not differ from the warfarin group. There was a clear dose-response for major bleeding among patients treated with SanOrg34006 (P = 0.003). Patients receiving 2.5 mg SanOrg34006 had less bleeding than did warfarin recipients (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

SanOrg34006 dosed at 2.5 mg appears as effective as higher dosages and warfarin for secondary prevention in DVT and was not associated with major bleeding. Therefore, 2.5 mg of SanOrg34006 administered subcutaneously once weekly might be a suitable alternative to dose-adjusted oral vitamin K antagonist.

Coagulation and anticoagulation considerations during CAR T cell therapy — coagulopathies frequently occur in the context of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported at rates of more than 2% for the approved CAR T cell products. Warfarin (Coumadin) has a serum half-life of, on average, roughly 40 hours and the duration of effect is 2–5 days, and current major guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin over warfarin for thrombosis prophylaxis in patients with cancer. The risk for bleeding complications on anticoagulation is considerable; a meta-analysis of 33 studies involving 4374 patientyears of oral anticoagulant therapy found that the case-fatality rate of major bleeding was 13.4% (95% CI 9.4% to 17.4%). Antiplatelet blood thinners such as aspirin also increase bleeding risks.

### Efficacy and tolerability of the switch from a branded to a generic warfarin sodium product: an observer-blinded, randomized, crossover study [^114drSKL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is an essential part of the management of numerous cardiovascular conditions. Although warfarin sodium has been in clinical use for > 40 years, only 1 proprietary warfarin preparation was in use for long-term anticoagulation in Taiwan until 2001, when the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration approved a new generic formulation.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of switching from an established dose of the branded warfarin sodium product (in mg/wk) to the same dose of the generic product.

Methods

This was a randomized, observer-blinded, crossover study in Taiwanese patients who received a mechanical heart valve to replace an original valve or a previously implanted mechanical valve from March 2003 to August 2004 and had received branded warfarin therapy for ≥ 2 months postoperatively, with a mean baseline international normalized ratio (INR) in the range from 1.7 to 3.0 in the 8- to 12-week run-in period. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences, each involving three 28-day periods: the generic product for 1 period followed by the branded product for 2 periods, or the branded product for 1 period followed by the generic product for 2 periods. Prothrombin time and INR were measured, and anticoagulant activity was compared. At each visit, treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded and evaluated by the blinded observer, an internal medicine physician who was not involved in patients' care.

Results

Thirty-five patients were enrolled (25 men, 10 women; mean age, 52.4 years [range, 34.5–74.4 years]). All but 2 of the patients had received a replacement for a natural heart valve. Thirty-four patients (16 who received the generic product initially, 18 who received the branded product initially) completed the study without a dose change and were ≥ 75% compliant with therapy. There was no difference in pooled mean (SE) INR between the 2 products (2.28 [0.06] and 2.27 [0.06], respectively). The 90% CI for the difference was 96.4 to 104.9, well within the range for bioequivalence (80–120). There were no differences in the adverse-event profiles of the 2 formulations.

Conclusions

No therapeutic inequivalence was demonstrated in this small, single-blind study, suggesting that the generic and branded warfarin products studied were equally effective in maintaining anticoagulation in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. The 2 products had similar safety profiles.

### Integration of genetic, clinical, and INR data to refine warfarin dosing [^115VbKqa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Well-characterized genes that affect warfarin metabolism (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9) and sensitivity (vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1)) explain one-third of the variability in therapeutic dose before the international normalized ratio (INR) is measured. To determine genotypic relevance after INR becomes available, we derived clinical and pharmacogenetic refinement algorithms on the basis of INR values (on day 4 or 5 of therapy), clinical factors, and genotype. After adjusting for INR, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes remained significant predictors (P < 0.001) of warfarin dose. The clinical algorithm had an R² of 48% (median absolute error (MAE): 7.0 mg/week) and the pharmacogenetic algorithm had an R² of 63% (MAE: 5.5 mg/week) in the derivation set (N = 969). In independent validation sets, the R² was 26–43% with the clinical algorithm and 42–58% when genotype was added (P = 0.002). After several days of therapy, a pharmacogenetic algorithm estimates the therapeutic warfarin dose more accurately than one using clinical factors and INR response alone.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113fT5fD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) was published by Giugliano RP and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the trial question was: is edoxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with AF? In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the population was: 14071 patients (5310 female, 8761 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk. The key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible disorder; high risk of bleeding; use of dual antiplatelet therapy; moderate-to-severe MS; other indications for anticoagulation therapy; acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, or stroke in the past 30 days. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 7035 high-dose edoxaban (60 mg/day) n = 7036 warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2.0–3.0). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in stroke or systemic embolic events (1.18% vs. 1.5%; HR 0.79, 97.5% CI 0.63 to 0.99). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes (3.85% vs. 4.43%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes (2.74% vs. 3.17%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.7% vs. 0.75%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke and systemic embolic events. significant difference in major bleeding events (2.75% vs. 3.43%). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk, high-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke or systemic embolic events.

Collection of data and assessment of the risk of bias

Two members of the review team independently screened titles and abstracts. We assessed full texts of all potentially relevant reports for inclusion, having collated multiple reports from the same studies. We extracted the following data: study details (identifier, study design, location, year, length of follow-up, and industry sponsorship); participant details (number of participants, age, and sex); intervention details (drug name, dose, and timing); comparator details; details relevant to the risk of bias assessment (including adherence to and withdrawal from randomised allocation); and effect modifiers. Multiple reports from a study informed a single data extraction form. We extracted dichotomous data as number of events in intervention and control groups and numbers of participants, and we sought details of follow-up time. We also extracted estimates of hazard ratios and their confidence intervals where available. We extracted intention to treat data where these were reported. Otherwise we extracted the data as reported (often a modified intention to treat based on, eg, all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug).

Data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane tool were carried out by one reviewer (GNO) in a Microsoft Access data collection form, and checked by a second reviewer (PB). Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by referral to a third reviewer (PAD or JS) where necessary.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis

We generated network plots of comparisons to illustrate which interventions had been compared within randomised trials (direct comparisons). Different doses or frequencies of administration (once daily or twice daily) of DOACs were analysed separately and hence appear as separate points in network plots. We defined two independent nodes for warfarin interventions, labelled as warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) and warfarin (INR 3.0–4.0) respectively. The first of these formed the reference treatment across all networks. We also included in warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) some interventions with an INR range of 2.5–3.5 or 2.0–4.5. In some trials the INR range for some patients in the warfarin arm was subtherapeutic (below 2.0), so that the total INR range was 1.6–3.0. These interventions were excluded from the main analysis, but merged with the INR 2.0–3.0 node in a sensitivity analysis.
