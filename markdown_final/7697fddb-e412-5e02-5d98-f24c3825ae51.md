## Question

Cause of low rdw

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of low RDW. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what RDW actually measures and how it is calculated. Then, I should verify the normal reference range and what "low" means clinically. Next, I will consider the biological conditions that would make RDW small or homogeneous. After that, I should review the literature for direct evidence of low RDW associations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and note limitations and exceptions where low RDW might still be informative.

> Let me first confirm the definition and calculation so I don't misinterpret the parameter. RDW is the coefficient of variation of red blood cell volume, essentially SD divided by MCV, which means it reflects the degree of anisocytosis in circulating RBCs; a low RDW implies that RBCs are relatively uniform in size, whereas a high RDW indicates size heterogeneity, often due to mixed populations or dyserythropoiesis.

> Wait, let me verify the normal range before labeling something "low". Most clinical laboratories report a reference interval around 11.0% to 16.0%, though instrument-specific cutoffs vary; importantly, many prognostic studies operationalize "elevated" as greater than about 14.5%, which underscores that values below roughly 11–12% are indeed on the low end of normal and may carry different clinical implications than high RDW [^7ed56761].

> I will now examine what biology would plausibly yield a low RDW. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: low RDW requires either a very narrow distribution of RBC volumes or a high MCV that mathematically compresses the coefficient of variation; clinically, that scenario arises when erythropoiesis is homogeneous and effective, without reticulocytosis or mixed populations, and when there is minimal nutritional or inflammatory stress affecting RBC production or survival.

> Next, I should review direct evidence linking low RDW to specific outcomes. Let me consider the most striking signal: a large population-based cohort found that low RDW was associated with increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, particularly in those with impaired fasting glucose; the adjusted hazard ratio for the lowest versus highest RDW quartile was about 1.48, and the authors proposed that low RDW may reflect shortened RBC lifespan and consequently lower HbA1c, masking glycemic burden, which is a mechanistically coherent explanation for a paradoxical association with diabetes risk [^1cb4beed].

> But wait, what if low RDW simply reflects excellent erythropoietic function rather than a pathologic state? I need to check whether low RDW has been used as a favorable comparator in any disease contexts. Indeed, in studies of acute appendicitis, patients with acute appendicitis had lower RDW than healthy controls, suggesting that in inflammatory disease states, a relatively normal or low RDW may contrast with the elevated RDW typically seen in chronic inflammatory or nutritionally stressed conditions; however, this is hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously given study design limitations [^89651015].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Low RDW generally reflects homogeneous RBC size with effective, stable erythropoiesis and minimal anisocytosis; in most clinical settings this is not pathological and simply indicates a tight RBC volume distribution. However, in specific epidemiologic contexts, particularly diabetes risk assessment, low RDW has been linked to increased incident diabetes, plausibly via shortened RBC survival and reduced HbA1c exposure, so a low RDW in a high-risk patient may warrant careful interpretation of glycemic markers and clinical context rather than reassurance alone [^1cb4beed].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and exceptions. Low RDW is not a recognized stand-alone disease marker like elevated RDW, and most prognostic literature focuses on high RDW associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation; thus, isolated low RDW should not trigger specific diagnostic pathways but may prompt reconsideration of glycemic assessment in at-risk patients or serve as a baseline for tracking changes over time if clinical status evolves [^3d748fae] [^1cb4beed].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: low RDW usually signifies uniform RBC size and effective erythropoiesis without nutritional or inflammatory stress, and is typically nonpathological. However, in diabetes risk research, low RDW has been associated with higher incident diabetes, likely reflecting altered RBC turnover and HbA1c dynamics, so clinicians should integrate low RDW with the full clinical picture rather than ignore it or overinterpret it in isolation [^1cb4beed] [^8351bcac].

Low RDW reflects **uniform RBC size** and is most often seen with **chronic, non-progressive anemias** such as anemia of chronic disease, thalassemia trait, or aplastic anemia, where erythropoiesis is homogeneous and stable [^084c709f]. It can also occur in **nutritional deficiencies** (B12, folate, iron) when the deficiency is mild or early, before anisocytosis develops, or with **recent transfusion** that temporarily normalizes RBC size variability. Low RDW is generally non-specific and should be interpreted with MCV, hemoglobin, and clinical context; persistent low RDW in the setting of anemia warrants evaluation for chronic disease, thalassemia, or marrow failure.

---

## Physiological basis of low RDW

RDW is the **coefficient of variation of RBC volume**, so low RDW means RBCs are similar in size. This uniformity arises when erythropoiesis is stable and homogeneous, producing RBCs of consistent volume without significant size variation [^41570bef].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with low RDW

### Anemias with homogeneous erythropoiesis

- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Typically normocytic or mildly microcytic with normal or low RDW because erythropoiesis is homogeneous and stable [^notfound].
- **Thalassemia trait**: Microcytic anemia with low RDW due to uniform microcytosis from reduced globin synthesis [^notfound].
- **Aplastic anemia**: Normocytic anemia with low RDW from uniform marrow failure and homogeneous erythropoiesis [^084c709f].

---

### Nutritional deficiencies (early or mild)

In early or mild **iron deficiency**, RDW may be normal or low before anisocytosis emerges; as deficiency worsens, RDW rises. Early **vitamin B12 or folate deficiency** can also show low RDW before macrocytosis and anisocytosis develop.

---

### Recent blood transfusion

After transfusion, **donor RBCs are uniform in size**, temporarily lowering RDW until the patient's own RBCs re-enter circulation.

---

### Laboratory artifacts or technical factors

Pre-analytical issues such as **improper sample mixing**, **old samples**, or **instrument calibration** can artifactually lower RDW; repeating the CBC can clarify.

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Non-specific marker**: Low RDW is less specific than high RDW and should be interpreted with MCV, hemoglobin, and clinical context.
- **Chronic disease indicator**: Persistent low RDW in anemia suggests chronic disease, thalassemia trait, or marrow failure.
- **Early deficiency**: Low RDW in suspected deficiency may reflect early disease before anisocytosis appears.

## Diagnostic approach to low RDW

| **Step** | **Diagnostic action** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Review CBC indices (MCV, MCH, hemoglobin) | Classify anemia and assess RBC morphology |
| 2 | Assess clinical history (chronic disease, transfusion, diet) | Identify underlying causes |
| 3 | Consider thalassemia testing (hemoglobin electrophoresis) | Confirm thalassemia trait |
| 4 | Evaluate for chronic disease or inflammation (CRP, ESR) | Support ACD diagnosis |
| 5 | Repeat CBC if artifact suspected | Exclude pre-analytical error |

---

Low RDW reflects **uniform RBC size** and is most often seen with chronic, non-progressive anemias, early or mild nutritional deficiencies, or recent transfusion. It is non-specific and should be interpreted alongside other indices and the clinical context; persistent low RDW in anemia merits evaluation for chronic disease, thalassemia, or marrow failure.

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^3d748fae]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### Role of red blood cell distribution width, as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^121e53c0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW), an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies, evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis. Our search retrieved 25 studies, with a total of 18,392 and 3,446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31–0.71; I² = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26–0.67; I² = 60%, respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2,980 patients, RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96–3.82; I² = 56%). However, the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^41570bef]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume (MCV), an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies, have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Because RBCs characteristically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, persistence of these older, smaller cells thus increases volume variance, and this clearance delay coincides with and offsets a net decrease in RBC production. These reports suggest the possibility that an elevated RDW in some circumstances may reflect a clinical state in which RBC production and turnover have slowed in the setting of increased production and turnover of leukocytes or platelets such as would occur in inflammation. Although a definitive mechanism for RDW elevation has not yet been established, there is evidence that RDW can provide robust risk-stratification among patients diagnosed with the same acute illness. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether an association exists between mortality risk and elevated RDW measured at hospital admission and during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^8351bcac]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. It is indicated that the variation coefficient of the red blood cell volume is more objective and accurate than that of the red blood cell on the blood smear. RDW is in about 11.0%–16.0% in normal population. RDW will rise under some physiological and pathological conditions.

RDW has at least five clinical significant meanings:
To diagnose and guide the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Traditionally, anaemia deficiency from iron can be differentiated from folate deficiency according to the size of RDW. RDW would increase because of the release of immature red blood cells into the blood stream in certain haematological diseases.RDW increases in iron deficiency anaemia, and such increase would appear earlier than the decline of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which can be an early indication of iron deficiency. When MCV is low, RDW would increase more significantly. When iron therapy is given, RDW would elevate first and then gradually reduce at the normal level.
To diagnose small cell and low pigment anaemia.
To classify anaemia.
Previously, many research suggested that RDW was closely related to the mortality and cardiovascular events, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension.
RDW can be made as a predictor of mortality in patients with cancer, chronic lung disease or acute renal failure.

Stroke is the result of cerebral vascular occlusion or haemorrhage, and it is the leading cause of death in the world. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on history, neurological examinations and neuro-imaging. Several scoring systems are used to quantify the degree of severity of stroke: the Glasgow Coma Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, there is no biological surrogate marker to diagnose stroke. RDW by flow cytometry could be an option for this purpose and predict the occurrence of stroke.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^78dbb02b]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific biological mechanisms about association between higher RAR and increased risk of low cognitive performance have not yet been fully elucidated, but may be related to chronic inflammation and poor nutritional status. RAR is a composite indicator integrating RDW and albumin, with increases in RDW and decreases in albumin both contributing to elevated RAR levels. Several studies have indicated that elevated RDW is associated with cognitive decline. A cross-sectional study indicated a "J-shaped" relationship between elevated RDW levels and the likelihood of dementia in older adults. Additionally, a prospective cohort study highlighted a causal impact of RDW on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated RDW is commonly associated with systemic inflammatory states, which can affect erythropoiesis, red blood cell lifespan, and red blood cell deformability, leading to increased cell anisotropy and subsequently raising RDW levels. Chronic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying low cognitive performance. Abnormal deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes in the central nervous system, triggering neuroinflammatory responses. Prolonged inflammatory conditions result in structural and functional damage to neurons, further contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, which is considered a contributing factor to CI and Alzheimer's disease. In the condition of anemia, pathological changes in red blood cells, including alterations in quantity, volume, distribution, and overall mass, can reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypoxic changes in cerebral blood vessels may be a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to low cognitive performance and dementia. Our study also found that participants with higher RAR often had lower hemoglobin levels and a higher risk of low cognitive performance.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^96a0ce2b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent and progressive airway inflammation and/or emphysema. This causes airflow limitation, resulting in symptoms like coughing, mucus production, wheezing, and shortness of breath. According to statistics, COPD has become one of the top three causes of death in the world, and many patients have died from it or its complications. In 2019, more than 3.3 million people died from COPD which was the primary cause of deaths from COPD. The global burden of mortality in COPD patients remains substantial, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. This disease poses substantial challenges for both patients and healthcare systems, under-scoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a simple and inexpensive hematological parameter that reflects the degree of heterogeneity in red blood cell volume, has been traditionally used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of anemia. As a dynamic parameter responsive to internal and external stimuli, RDW levels provide a sensitive gauge of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. Clinical studies have shown that RDW is associated with various diseases and disease outcomes, and RDW is now recognized as a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the general population. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have confirmed that patients with stable COPD and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (AECOPD) have higher RDW levels compared with healthy individual. Furthermore, some studies have confirmed that RDW is related to mortality in patients with COPD. Hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is a new combined biomarker proposed by Sun et al. in their study on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer. HRR is considered an inflammatory marker and is associated with the incidence and adverse events of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship between HRR and mortality in patients with COPD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HRR is a better predictor of mortality compared to RDW in these patients.

Consequently, our primary objective is to evaluate the association of RDW and HRR with mortality in COPD patients, and to compare their predictive roles for mortality in these patients.

### Association between the red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation with colon cancer and all-cause mortality: insights from the 1999–2018 NHANES [^6add7ba0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colon cancer, a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. The etiology of CRC is multifactorial, involving complex interactions between genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical inactivity, smoking), and socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. These diverse risk factors contribute to significant heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and outcomes, underscoring the need for improved strategies to identify individuals at higher risk within the general population. Early identification of at-risk individuals could enable timely screening and preventive interventions, thereby reducing the overall burden of colon cancer.

Due to the frequently asymptomatic nature of early-stage disease, diagnosis often occurs at advanced stages, resulting in worse clinical outcomes. This is particularly evident in high-risk populations that present diagnostic challenges, such as pregnant women. A large population-based study indicates that although colorectal cancer during pregnancy is rare, its prognosis remains exceedingly poor, with maternal mortality rates reaching 39% and more than half of cases (53%) already classified as stage IV at the time of diagnosis. These statistics underscore the significant challenges in early detection and risk stratification within routine clinical practice, especially for atypical populations. Although population-based screening programs, such as fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy, have contributed to earlier diagnosis, their uptake remains suboptimal due to barriers such as invasiveness, cost, and limited access, particularly among community-based or underserved populations. Therefore, identifying accessible and cost-effective prognostic biomarkers is essential to improve the overall management of colorectal cancer.

Among potential biomarkers for CRC, red cell distribution width (RDW) and its coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) — routinely measured in complete blood counts — have garnered increasing attention. RDW-CV reflects variability in red blood cell size and is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status, all of which may contribute to cancer development. Elevated RDW-CV has been linked to advanced tumor stage, poor differentiation, and unfavorable prognosis in CRC patients. However, most previous studies have focused on patients with established CRC, and evidence regarding the association between RDW-CV and incident colon cancer risk or all-cause mortality in community-dwelling populations remains limited. Given the widespread availability and low cost of RDW-CV testing, it holds potential as a tool for early risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals.

### Red cell distribution width and risk of coronary heart disease events [^53fc44b5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in variety of cardiovascular settings. However, no data are available associating RDW with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a healthy and nationally representative multiethnic population. A total of 7,556 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2006 (age 41.5 ± 15.8 years, 60% women) were divided into 3 categories according to their 10-year Framingham risk of hard CHD events: < 10% (n = 6,173, reference category), 10% to 20% (n = 1,093, intermediate-risk category), and > 20% (n = 290, high-risk category). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed evaluating RDW as a predictor of CHD risk. Each unit increase (0.1) in RDW posed a statistically significant greater odds of being in the intermediate-risk category (odds ratio -1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and high-risk category (odds ratio -1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.53, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category, after adjusting for race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume. Additional adjustments with serum iron, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels did not affect the association. Subsequently, we divided participants into 2 categories according to their anemia status (as defined by the World Health Organization) to evaluate its effect. An RDW level greater than the seventy-fifth percentile in both anemic and nonanemic participants was a significant predictor of greater CHD risk while RDW of the seventy-fifth percentile or less in anemic participants failed to predict CHD (compared to nonanemic participants with similar RDW as the reference category). In conclusion, a higher RDW appears to be a powerful independent predictor of future CHD risk.

### Red cell distribution width and mortality in Hemodialysis Patients [^f5382a1b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell volume variability that has historically been used as a marker of iron deficiency anemia. More recently, studies have shown that elevated RDW is associated with higher mortality risk in the general population. However, there is lack of data demonstrating the association between RDW and mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We hypothesized that higher RDW is associated with higher mortality in HD patients.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study using a large HD patient cohort.

Setting & Participants

109,675 adult maintenance HD patients treated in a large dialysis organization from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011.

Predictor

Baseline and time-varying RDW, grouped into 5 categories: < 14.5%, 14.5% to < 15.5%, 15.5% to < 16.5%, 16.5% to < 17.5%, and ≥ 17.5%. RDW of 15.5% to < 16.5% was used as the reference category.

Outcome

All-cause mortality.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 63 ± 15 (SD) years and the study cohort was 44% women. In baseline and time-varying analyses, there was a graded association between higher RDW and incrementally higher mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic, net reclassification analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated that RDW is a stronger predictor of mortality as compared with traditional markers of anemia, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation values.

Limitations

Lack of comprehensive data that may be associated with both RDW and HD patient outcomes, such as blood transfusion data, socioeconomic status, and other unknown confounders; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding could not be excluded. Also, lack of information for cause of death; thus, cardiovascular mortality outcomes could not be examined.

Conclusions

In HD patients, higher RDW is associated with incrementally higher mortality risk. RDW is also a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional laboratory markers of anemia. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality.

### Red cell distribution width, haemoglobin A1c and incidence of diabetes mellitus [^1cb4beed]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperglycaemia has multiple effects on the red blood cell (RBC), including glycation of haemoglobin, reduced deformability and reduced lifespan. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the heterogeneity of erythrocyte volumes. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between RDW and glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM).

Design, Setting and Subjects

RDW and mean corpuscular volume were measured in 26 709 non-diabetic participants (aged 45–73 years) from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort. HbA1c and fasting venous blood glucose levels were measured in 4845 subjects.

Main Outcome Measure

Incidence of DM (n = 2944) over 14 years of follow-up was studied by linkage with national and local DM registers.

Results

Individuals with low RDW had significantly higher risk of developing DM [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–1.70, for 1st vs. 4th quartile], especially in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (n = 416) (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.12–4.14). Low RDW was also associated with significantly higher waist circumference and glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations. By contrast, RDW was significantly and positively associated with HbA1c, corresponding an increase in HbA1c of 0.10% per 1 SD increase in RDW.

Conclusion

Low RDW is associated with increased incidence of DM independently of other risk factors. We propose that low RDW could be a surrogate marker of reduced RBC survival, with lower HbA1c due to shorter duration of glucose exposure. RDW is a biomarker that could improve risk assessment for individuals at risk of developing DM.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^0ccdc8a5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an automatic expression of hematologic analyzers reflecting the size variability of circulating red blood cells (RBC). It is a marker used together with other laboratory parameters to determine and narrow the cause of anemia and it has shown promising potential as an index of disease activity and severity in various pathologic conditions.

The diagnosis and follow up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are based on a combination of clinical indices, laboratory markers, endoscopy, histology and imaging modalities. However, these have various disadvantages, such as low sensitivity and specificity, high cost, limited availability, absence of simplicity, invasiveness, and lack of reproducibility.

The demand for an index used to recognize and monitor disease activity in IBD that overcomes these disadvantages still remains unmet. Since RDW expresses a lot of attractive characteristics, a number of clinical studies have been performed to evaluate its application as a surrogate marker of disease activity in IBD. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library through December 2019. Search terms included "red cell distribution width", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Crohn's Disease" and "Ulcerative Colitis", and we critically reviewed all relevant articles published in English. The intention of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the utility of RDW as a marker of activity in IBD.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

### Association between red blood cell distribution width and mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed4e57d9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47–0.97; I² = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63–1.23; I² = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28–0.94; I² = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7ed56761]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^031a2a5b]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^456d4cf1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin concentration (RAR) associated with mortality in the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 469 572 participants at baseline and 44 383 deaths during follow-up periods, higher RAR levels were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^5ca5cec4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that the RAR, which is derived from blood RDW and serum albumin concentrations, was strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, as well as mortality due to malignant neoplasm, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, and others in the general population. Additionally, since RAR is assessed via routine laboratory tests, it could be recognized as a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensively accessible for identifying individuals in clinical practice at high risk of mortality. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and investigate the potential relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality risk.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the platelet count in iron-deficient children aged 0.5–3 years [^ee97da86]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Early detection of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children is important to prevent impaired neurodevelopment. Unfortunately, many biomarkers of ID are influenced by infection, thus limiting their usefulness. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the platelet count for detecting ID(A) among otherwise healthy children. A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in the Netherlands to investigate the prevalence of ID(A) in 400 healthy children aged 0.5–3 years. ID was defined as serum ferritin (SF) < 12 μg/L in the absence of infection (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L) and IDA as hemoglobin < 110 g/L combined with ID. RDW (%) and the platelet count were determined in the complete blood cell count. RDW was inversely correlated with SF and not associated with CRP. Calculated cutoff values for RDW to detect ID and IDA gave a relatively low sensitivity (53.1% and 57.1%, respectively) and specificity (64.7% and 69.9%, respectively). Anemic children with a RDW > 14.3% had a 2.7 higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–6.3) to be iron deficient, compared with anemic children with a RDW < 14.3%. The platelet count showed a large range in both ID and non-ID children. In conclusion, RDW can be helpful for identifying ID as the cause of anemia in 0.5- to 3-year-old children, but not as primary biomarker of ID(A). RDW values are not influenced by the presence of infection. There appears to be no role for the platelet count in diagnosing ID(A) in this group of children.

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^cfd2081a]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recently, red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of erythrocyte size variability, has been shown to be a prognostic marker in critical illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding RDW has the potential to improve the prognostic performance of the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) to predict short- and long-term mortality in an independent, large, and unselected population of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

This observational cohort study includes 17,922 ICU patients with available RDW measurements from different types of ICUs. We modeled the association between RDW and mortality by using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, hematocrit, and severity of illness by using the SAPS.

Results

ICU-, in-hospital-, and 1-year mortality rates in the 17,922 included patients were 7.6% (95% CI, 7.2 to 8.0), 11.2% (95% CI, 10.8 to 11.7), and 25.4% (95% CI, 24.8 to 26.1). RDW was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR per 1% increase in RDW (95%CI)) (1.14 (1.08 to 1.19), P < 0.0001), ICU mortality (1.10 (1.06 to 1.15), P < 0.0001), and 1-year mortality (1.20 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.26); P < 0.001). Adding RDW to SAPS significantly improved the AUC from 0.746 to 0.774 (P < 0.001) for in-hospital mortality and 0.793 to 0.805 (P < 0.001) for ICU mortality. Significant improvements in classification of SAPS were confirmed in reclassification analyses. Subgroups demonstrated robust results for gender, age categories, SAPS categories, anemia, hematocrit categories, and renal failure.

Conclusions

RDW is a promising independent short- and long-term prognostic marker in ICU patients and significantly improves risk stratification of SAPS. Further research is needed the better to understand the pathophysiology underlying these effects.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^4ef316b7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Elevated RDW on admission is a recently described risk factor for adverse outcome in cardiac problems.

- This study demonstrates that elevated RDW in young patients hospitalized with CAP is a significant risk factor for complicated hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.

- Conceivably, measuring RDW in the emergency department might offer the clinician a simple yet powerful tool in the process of decision making whether to admit patients with CAP.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^40cf517b]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a coefficient of variation in red blood cell (RBC) volume, is routinely available in reports of complete blood count. RDW is commonly increased because of erythropoiesis deficits or accelerated RBC destruction. RDW increase is often considered as an indicator of anemia caused by iron, cobalamin, or folate deficiency. Recent studies have indicated that patients with higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and new-onset stroke. Moreover, the level of RDW was positively correlated with mortality in patients with acute or critical illnesses, in those with chronic diseases, and in healthy cohorts. Patel et al. reported a 14% increased risk of death for each 1% increment in RDW in a community-based elderly population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are well-known risk factors for CV events and mortality. RDW significantly increases when CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. According to our review of the relevant literature, few reports have focused on RDW in patients with CKD. Hsieh et al. revealed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and infection mortality in CKD stages 3–5. Inadequate erythropoietin production is the primary feature of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia reduces oxygen delivery and increases cardiac workload, which exacerbates heart failure and increases the risk of CV events. However, anemia is not the only possible explanation of elevated RDW in patients with CKD. The association of RDW with CV events and mortality was observed to be significant after adjustment for hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes during CKD stages 1–5. We hypothesized that elevated RDW is an independent risk factor for CV events and mortality in patients with CKD.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^60fa2984]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The identification of new biomarkers for the early detection of increased risk of mortality remains an unmet need. There has been significant progress in establishing the epidemiology of novel blood biomarkers for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as serum neurofilament light chain, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, retinol, alpha tocopherol, and beta carotene. Despite this progress, simple, inexpensive, and reliable indicators are still essential for predicting mortality in clinical practice. At present, routine laboratory tests are widely used in primary care and hospitals, and further use of routine clinical biomarkers is expected. For example, several new biomarkers, such as the prognostic nutritional index, ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte, and ratio of platelet to lymphocyte, were derived from routine laboratory tests. These simple integrated biomarkers showed significant associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. Therefore, there is still substantial interest in the use of routine biomarkers to identify persons who are at risk for mortality.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker from routine laboratory tests, reflects the degree of heterogeneity in erythrocyte volume. Increased RDW, resulting from impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, are associated with a variety of disorders and mortality. Serum albumin, the most abundant circulating protein in the blood, is an important marker of nutritional status and the inflammatory response. The physiological properties of albumin include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet aggregation activities as well as colloid osmotic effects. Several studies have reported that the serum albumin concentration is inversely associated with the incidence of dysfunction, disease, and mortality. Additionally, RDW is positively correlated with chronological age, while serum albumin is negatively correlated with chronological age, and RDW and albumin are associated with phenotypic and biological age and contribute greatly to individual variances in aging pace.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^2c97746a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Several explanations were suggested to this surprising finding. Abnormal RDW usually suggests one or more chronic condition that accompanies significant heart failure, such as anemia or nutritional deficit. Another mechanism that was suggested is the release of cytokines in response to inflammatory stress. These cytokines block the activity of erythropoietin and cause production of ineffective red blood cell and elevated RDW. Lippi et al found a correlation between high RDW and elevated indexes of inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This correlation was independent of concomitant diseases, and was demonstrated even when anemic patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Our data demonstrated that RDW is a valuable and sensitive marker for a high level of inflammatory activity in young patients with CAP, and it is independent of hemoglobin levels. The mechanism underlying the association between high levels of RDW and adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. RDW is elevated in conditions in which there is ineffective red cell production or increased destruction of red blood cell. RDW may indicate a severe inflammatory process, with impact on bone marrow function and iron metabolism. Another option is that RDW is an earlier marker of prognosis, and it may appear earlier in the complex process of anemia than low levels of hemoglobin. As noted before, high RDW levels may represent a culmination of multiple pathophysiologic processes occurring in acute inflammatory and infectious state.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^d0291e1b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, RDW measured at admission and during hospitalization was associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality. RDW is a routine laboratory test that may be useful in risk stratification of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^07a4cab2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Immidiate diagnosis of this disease is crucial, because this condition can lead to appendiceal perforation, potential peritonitis, and even death. We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width (RDW) in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. and wanted to discuss whether RDW alone provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient with acute appendicitis.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^084c709f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Utility of red cell distribution width in screening for iron deficiency [^e6b1b0d9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the sensitivity of an adult-derived red cell distribution width (RDW) reference limit in the detection of iron deficiency in young children.

Methods

Haematological analysis performed on a cohort of 13-month-old healthy term infants of North European ancestry.

Results

21/98 infants were iron-deficient (> 2.5% hypochromic red cells). Of the remaining 77, 35 with RDW > 13.9% also had evidence of incipient iron deficiency on the basis of significantly lower haemoglobin (11.5 vs 11.8 g/dl, p = 0.046), mean cell volume (75.6 vs 77.8 fl, p = 0.002) and mean cell haemoglobin (25.4 vs 26.2 pg, p = 0.002) values and higher zinc protoporphyrin (55 vs 44 μmol/molhaem, p < 0.001) values than those of the 42 with RDW ≤ 13.9%.

Conclusions

An adult-derived RDW reference limit has utility in screening for iron deficiency at the age of 13 months. The incidence of non-anaemic iron deficiency in this group was 52.8%.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^10724211]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio (RAR) is a novel comprehensive biomarker of inflammation and nutrition, used to evaluate immune status and immune response. Specifically, RDW serves as a biomarker that reflects the heterogeneity in red blood cell (RBC) volume. Multiple large-scale cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analyses have demonstrated a causal relationship between RDW and CI, as well as Alzheimer's disease. Serum albumin stands as a pivotal biomarker for assessing nutritional status and inflammation. Numerous studies have demonstrated a correlation between serum albumin levels and both neurodegenerative diseases and blood-brain barrier permeability. Previous studies have identified that RDW and serum albumin levels serve as biomarkers for multidimensional dysfunctions related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrition, but they represent these pathological aspects from different perspectives. It is noteworthy that the RAR, which combines RDW and serum albumin, has demonstrated significant predictive value in the prognosis of stroke and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent studies have found that RAR can accurately predict the prognosis of patients with community-acquired bacteremia, acute pancreatitis, and rheumatic diseases. However, the relationship between RAR and low cognitive performance in older adults remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between RAR and low cognitive ability in the elderly, with the hope of contributing to the understanding of the pathogenesis of low cognitive ability and early identification.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a7bec852]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^97447d64]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^2f6ca6c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^62d22b8d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The results from studies included in this review showed that mean values of RDW were statistically significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls. With respect to the rather limited data, based on only 2 clinical trials, RDW could be used as an effective marker to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. In the majority of the aforementioned studies RDW, at different cutoff values, showed a remarkable sensitivity and specificity in detecting active disease, calculated by means of clinical indices, endoscopic scores and laboratory parameters. RDW also showed a positive but variable correlation with well-established inflammatory biomarkers used in everyday clinical practice such as CRP, ESR, and to a lesser extent WBC and PLT, in both anemic and non-anemic IBD patients. Therefore, RDW could be considered an attractive disease activity marker in IBD, as it is calculated automatically in every CBC, has a low cost, is minimally invasive, has no specific technical requirements and can be easily reproduced.

On the other hand, there are certain aspects concerning its broad application that must be elucidated. There was great variability in the thresholds adopted for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the selection of cutoffs was arbitrary and data driven. Most studies were retrospective and were case-control studies. The use of controls in diagnostic accuracy studies usually results in overestimation of both sensitivity and specificity. Large-scale well-designed prospective studies for standardization of the cutoff value of RDW should now be mandatory. It is also necessary to conduct such studies in order to evaluate whether the limited but rather encouraging data are sufficient to establish RDW as a reliable activity index. Finally, there is a need to look deeper and clarify the pathophysiology of this relation. RDW seems to be a promising cost-effective tool that can be used to evaluate and monitor disease activity in IBD, but this requires more extensive and detailed research in the future.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^b6b3439c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

CRP is a sensitive acute phase protein that lacks specificity due to increased levels in all acute inflammatory processes. Its concentration increases with the duration and extent of the inflammation. In a meta-analysis examining the accuracy of CRP level in the diagnosis of AA, Hallan and Asberg found a wide range of sensitivity (40%-99%) and specificity (27%-90%). Similar to the literature, this study found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 41% for CRP in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Among the assessed parameters, CRP had the highest sensitivity and the lowest specificity.

RDW is commonly used to discriminate between microcytic anemia's due to iron deficiency and those due to thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies. Increased RDW levels are related to impaired erythropoiesis or erythrocyte degradation. The typical reference range spans between 11.6 and 15.5%. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher RDW levels, even within the normal reference range, were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and stroke independent of hemoglobin values. Furthermore RDW has been studied as a surrogate marker in many pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and celiac disease. Although the exact pathophysiological basis of this relationship is unclear, chronic inflammation, aging, malnutrition, and anemia are proposed underlying factors in this topic.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^5537cb91]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^1cd238c5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

Conclusion

In conclusion, RDW was positively associated with beta cell function in LADA individuals with low GAD titers. We observed a negative correlation between RDW and HbA1c in LADA patients with high GAD titers but not with low GAD titers. However, we need further large-scale studies or cohort studies to verify the relationship and interaction mechanism between RDW and beta cell function among LADA patients.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^738fa0b1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often anemic and have high RDW levels. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes among patients with CKD.

We retrospectively analyzed patients with CKD who were admitted to the department of cardiology of a tertiary hospital in 2011. The patients were divided into 2 groups: normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood investigation results, prescriptions, and outcomes were analyzed after a 3-year follow-up period. Six adjustment levels were performed to evaluate the effect of RDW on outcomes.

Results

This study involved 282 patients with CKD: 213 in the elevated RDW group and 69 in the normal RDW group. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values, lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin levels, and higher creatinine levels, compared with the normal RDW group. A linear trend was observed toward higher RDW in patients with deteriorating renal function. In the final adjusted model, RDW ≥ 14.5%, older age, and lower LVEF were associated with an increased risk of major composite CV outcomes.

Conclusion

RDW is a potentially useful cost-effective indicator of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Red blood cell distribution width is not a reliable biomarker for low iron stores in children with cystic fibrosis [^60c76d81]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Low iron stores in children, absolute iron deficiency (AID), can lead to impaired neurodevelopment and requires iron therapy. In the presence of infection/inflammation, like in cystic fibrosis (CF), serum ferritin (SF) is not a reliable biomarker for AID. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a promising alternative reported not to be influenced by infection in healthy children. Currently, there are no data on the diagnostic capacity of RDW to detect AID in pediatric CF patients. This was a prospective observational study that investigated iron status biomarkers in 53 Dutch pediatric CF patients. AID was defined using World Health Organization criteria for SF in stable patients (no recent pulmonary exacerbation) and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≤ 10 mg/l. Patients with AID had higher RDW levels than patients without AID (p = 0.019). An RDW ≥ 13.2% showed the following test statistics: sensitivity 100%; specificity 39.4%; positive predictive value 20%; and negative predictive value 100%. Furthermore, we found a correlation between RDW and CRP in the total group that originated from the stable patients (r = 0.308; p = 0.042). In conclusion, the diagnostic capacity of RDW for detecting AID in pediatric CF patients seems limited because RDW levels might also be influenced by chronic infection/inflammation in these patients.

### Red cell distribution width is an independent predictor of mortality in necrotizing fasciitis [^a1bb980d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing and potentially lethal infectious disease of the soft tissue. An elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with increased risk of death in patients with heart disease and infectious disease. We retrospectively assessed the association of elevated RDW with in-hospital mortality due to NF.

Methods

All patients had diagnoses of NF and were admitted to the emergency department of a single institution in Taiwan over a 4-year period. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and laboratory parameters were retrospectively reviewed. Red blood cell distribution width was categorized as elevated (> 14.5%) or not elevated. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality.

Results

A total of 98 patients were enrolled, and the mortality rate was 23%. Univariate analysis indicated that advanced age, initial hypotension, low hemoglobin level, and elevated RDW (69.6% vs 20%, OR = 9.14, P < .001) were significantly associated with mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that RDW was a significant and independent predictor of mortality in enrolled patients.

Conclusions

Elevated RDW is a significant and independent predictor of in-hospital mortality for patients with NF.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^4b4c540e]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A potential independent association was recently demonstrated between high red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients, although the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. Little is known about the impact changes in RDW may have on survival in critically ill patients. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of changes in RDW during hospital stay in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 329 patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) and received a standardized resuscitation algorithm (early-goal directed therapy) for severe sepsis or septic shock. The relationship between the changes in RDW during the first 72 hours after ED admission and all-cause mortality (28-day and 90-day) were analyzed by categorizing the patients into four groups according to baseline RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm (RDW at 72 hours - RDW at baseline).

Results

The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were 10% and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with increased RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm > 0.2% exhibited the highest risks of 28-day and 90-day mortality, whereas the patients with normal RDW level at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤ 0.2% (the reference group) had the lowest mortality risks. For 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in the patients whose RDW increased within 72 hours of ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm > 0.2%), compared to the reference group. These associations remained unaltered even after adjusting for age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, renal replacement therapy, albumin, hemoglobin, lactate, C-reactive protein and infection sites in multivariable models.

Conclusions

We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first 72 hours after hospitalization is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and inflammatory biomarkers in a large cohort of unselected outpatients [^f83acf0b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

A strong independent association has been recently observed between elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

Objective

To assess whether RDW is associated with plasma markers of inflammation since the mechanism(s) underlying this association remain unknown.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed results of RDW, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners for routine medical check-up.

Results

Cumulative results of RDW and other factors were retrieved from the database of our laboratory information system for 3845 adult outpatients during a 3-year period. When participants were grouped according to RDW quartiles, there were strong, graded increases of ESR and hsCRP (P < .001), both parameters being up to 3-fold higher in the fourth versus the first quartile. Accordingly, the percentages of those with hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L (from 28% to 63%; P < .001) and ESR greater than 40 mm/h (from 8% to 40%; P < .001) increased steadily across RDW quartiles. In multivariable regression analysis, ESR and hsCRP predicted RDW independently of age, sex, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and ferritin.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time a strong, graded association of RDW with hsCRP and ESR independent of numerous confounding factors. If confirmed in future follow-up studies, this association might provide a rationale to introduce the easy, inexpensive RDW in algorithms for cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^1cd3a779]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) reflecting MCV heterogeneity (quantitative index of anisocytosis, i.e. the percentage coefficient of MCV variation) can be considered another parameter of ID. Increased RDW is, however, typical not only for anaemia due to ID, but also anaemia resulting from deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folic acid, of chronic diseases and sideroblastic anaemia. In HF patients, there are associations between high RDW, and reduced haemoglobin, low MCV, reduced Tsat, increased mortality and hospitalization rates. –

Owing to pathophysiological links and overlaps in regulatory mechanisms of erythropoietin and iron metabolism, – subjects with ID frequently have increased circulating erythropoietin levels, which can be considered another index of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in HF patients, being related to poor outcomes.

Increased soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is another sensitive indicator of ID. Soluble transferrin receptor is the truncated form of transmembrane protein, a receptor for iron–transferrin complex and the major system responsible for the intracellular iron import. It is present on virtually all cells, but a vast majority is localized on erythroid precursors. When iron delivery to target tissues is insufficient for metabolic requirements, the expression of the transferrin receptor increases in order to facilitate intracellular iron influx. Consequently, circulating sTfR (originating from all cells metabolizing iron) quantitatively reflects both the tissue iron demand (tissue iron balance) and the erythroid proliferation rate (total erythroblast mass), but not body iron stores. No study has used this biomarker to indicate and/or guide therapy, and so it should be regarded as a research tool.

Because serum ferritin is a surrogate of iron stores and serum sTfR reflects the tissue iron demand, there is evidence that the combination of these two parameters may describe the iron status more accurately.

### Red blood cell distribution width: a severity indicator in patients with COVID-19 [^7b093e96]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was frequently assessed in COVID-19 infection and reported to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, there was no consensus regarding the optimal cutoff value for RDW. Records of 98 patients with COVID-19 from the First People's Hospital of Jingzhou were reviewed. They were divided into two groups according to the cutoff value for RDW on admission by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis: ≤ 11.5% (n = 50) and > 11.5% (n = 48). The association of RDW with the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 was analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the RDW was a good discrimination factor for identifying COVID-19 severity (area under the curve = 0.728, 95% CI: 0.626–0.830, p < 0.001). Patients with RDW > 11.5% more frequently suffered from critical COVID-19 than those with RDW ≤ 11.5% (62.5% vs. 26.0%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed RDW to be an independent predictor for critical illness due to COVID-19 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.27–4.55, p = 0.007). A similar result was obtained when we included RDW > 11.5% into another model instead of RDW as a continuous variable (OR = 5.41, 95% CI: 1.53–19.10, p = 0.009). RDW, as an inexpensive and routinely measured parameter, showed promise as a predictor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection. RDW > 11.5% could be the optimal cutoff to discriminate critical COVID-19 infection.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^9a990cfb]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Measuring RDW on admission is relatively simple and can be done during routine evaluation at the emergency room. Our data suggest that it may offer the physician another tool in the process of decision making whether to admit a patient diagnosed with CAP, in addition to the various scores that were developed in recent years for this purpose. Indeed, if RDW is proven to be a prognostic factor in older patients admitted with CAP, it might even be incorporated into such scores. In concordance with our data, several studies demonstrated the relation between mortality and elevated RDW in middle aged and older adults. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show the poor prognostic effect of elevated RDW in young patients with CAP.

The major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. In addition, our study examined RDW as a prognostic factor only in patients 60 years old and less. The majority of mortality and severe mortality in patients with CAP is in elderly patients, many of them have chronic hematologic and inflammatory co-morbidities. A larger cohort of this complex population is needed to clarify RDW as an independent risk factor in this population and to validate it prospectively including other inflammatory markers such as CRP, procalcitonin and IL-6. Notably, our study was planned to detect the association between elevated RDW and prognosis of CAP; however, we did not examine whether this observation is unique to CAP or could be demonstrated in other inflammatory and infectious states.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^7485eba4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### Thrombocytopenia… [^5bb97551]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

OTHER CAUSES Aplastic anemia, chemotherapy, irradiation, acute leukemias, and myelodysplastic disorders may result in severe or symptomatic thrombocytopenia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is associated with hemolysis, renal disease, and thrombosis complications. Hospitalized patients with comorbid conditions, such as sepsis, trauma, burns, or malignancy, can develop disseminated intravascular coagulation with resultant thrombocytopenia. 29 Drug-induced thrombocytopenia should be suspected in all patients presenting with an acute drop in platelet count. Most patients with drug-induced thrombocytopenia have moderate to severe thrombocytopenia reaching a nadir platelet count of 20 × 10³ per μL. 8 Physicians should ask specific questions about the use of any medications, including nutritional supplements and over-the-counter remedies. Quinine is a common cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia and often is missed in the patient history.

INFECTIONS Infections may cause thrombocytopenia by direct bone marrow suppression or increased peripheral platelet consumption. Common viruses include hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, varicellazoster, rubella, and mumps. Recent studies found thrombocytopenia in 14 percent of hospitalized patients with influenza A virus. 31 Platelet counts usually recover in patients with a self-limited viral infection. If the patient has a recent travel history, especially to South America or Mexico, dengue fever and malaria should be considered. Other travel-associated infections, such as typhoid fever, can cause thrombocytopenia. 32 Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease are common tick-borne illnesses that can cause transient thrombocytopenia.
33. LIVER DISEASE Chronic liver disease usually causes persistent thrombocytopenia, and manifests as cirrhosis, fibrosis, and portal hypertension.

The most common cause is chronic alcohol abuse; however, other etiologies include infectious hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease, nonalcoholic liver disease, and metabolic disorders. Patients who consume excessive amounts of alcohol can present with varying degrees of liver impairment ranging from asymptomatic fatty liver to end-stage liver disease. Activity Participation and Invasive Procedures General recommendations for activity participation have been based on historical data from patients with chronic severe thrombocytopenia.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^89651015]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dear editor

We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. They aimed to evaluate whether red cell distribution width (RDW) has a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The authors concluded that if compared to healthy controls, RDW levels were lower in patients with acute appendicitis. Being inexpensive and easy attainability of this parameter may strengthen its utilization in daily practice in the near future. We would like to thank the authors for their contribution.

RDW which is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, is an automated measure of the variability of red blood cell size. Previously it was shown that, RDW is an independent variable of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, strokes, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, it was also found to be related to mortality and other severe adverse outcomes in renal and infectious diseases. Aging, malnutrition, Iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, bone marrow depression, or chronic inflammation may affect RDW levels. Thus, it would have been better, if the authors had mentioned these RDW affecting factors.

In a previous study, two novel biomarkers, calprotectin (CP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were found to be related to acute appendicitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and mean platelet volume (MPV) are also associated with inflammatory diseases. In this view, it would also be relevant, if the authors included these parameters in the study.

We are of the opinion that the findings of Narci et al. will lead to further research concerning the relationship between RDW and acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, RDW should be considered with other inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, calprotectin) to provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient.

### The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on red cell distribution width: a subanalysis of the FAIR-HF study [^050fa2ca]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variability in red blood cell size, is a novel prognostic marker in chronic heart failure (CHF). Iron deficiency contributes to elevated RDW. In the FAIR-HF trial, i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) improved the 6 min walk test (6MWT) distance in iron-deficient CHF patients. We studied the effect of FCM on RDW and the relationship between RDW and 6MWT distance.

Methods and Results

In FAIR-HF, iron-deficient CHF patients were randomized to FCM or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. From the total cohort (n = 459), we included 415 patients in whom RDW values and 6MWT distance were available for baseline and at least one follow-up visit (after 4, 12, and 24 weeks). Baseline RDW was higher in anaemic (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL) compared with non-anaemic patients [15.2% (14.0–16.8) vs. 14.2% (13.4–15.4), P < 0.0001, median (interquartile range)]. In multivariate analysis, RDW was significantly associated with transferrin saturation (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002). Treatment with FCM led to a biphasic response; RDW increased within 4 weeks (+0.54% absolute change from baseline, P = 0.01) but fell to values below the placebo group after 24 weeks (-1.0%, P = 0.03). The 6MWT distance and RDW were inversely related at baseline (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). In all patients, the increase in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks was significantly correlated with a decrease in RDW (r = -0.25, P < 0.0001), even after adjustment for changes in haemoglobin.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency in CHF is associated with high RDW, even after adjustment for the presence of anaemia. Treatment with i.v. FCM in iron-deficient CHF patients decreases RDW.

### Red blood cell distribution width and 1-year mortality in acute heart failure [^6c80264e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) predicts mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) and stable coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of RDW in more acute settings such as acute HF, and its relative prognostic value compared with more established measures such as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), remains unknown.

Methods and Results

In a cohort of 205 patients with acute HF, independent predictors of RDW were identified using linear regression analysis. The association between RDW and 1-year survival in the context of other predictors was assessed using Cox's proportional hazards analysis. Red blood cell distribution width was elevated in 67 (32.7%) patients; RDW was independently associated with haematological variables such as haemoglobin (P < 0.001) as well as the use of loop diuretics (P = 0.006) and beta-blockers (P = 0.015) on presentation, but not with nutritional deficiencies, recent transfusion, or inflammatory variables. Log-transformed RDW values independently predicted mortality in multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis (hazards ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.06; P = 0.04); when stratified on the basis of RDW and NT-proBNP status, the combination provided additional prognostic information.

Conclusion

Red blood cell distribution width is frequently elevated among patients with acute HF and does not appear to be associated with nutritional status, transfusion history, or inflammation. Red blood cell distribution width independently predicts 1-year mortality in acute HF. The value of RDW appears additive to other established prognostic variables such as NT-proBNP.

### Back to basics: red blood cell distribution width: clinical use beyond hematology… [^ed77c24d]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The complete blood cell count is a widely available and commonly used inexpensive laboratory test used in clinical practice. Information contained therein includes the white blood cell count and differential count, red blood cell count, RBC indices, hemoglobin level, hematocrit concentration, and platelet count. The RBC indices include the mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, and RBC distribution width. Traditionally, the clinical use of RDW has been limited to helping differentiate certain types of anemias. During the past decade, this quick and inexpensive test has been the subject of several studies attempting to evaluate its use as, among other things, an inflammatory marker, (.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^87569899]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### A mendelian randomization-based exploration of red blood cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume with risk of hemorrhagic strokes [^7b43e0c0]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhagic stroke results from bleeding into/around the brain when a weakened vessel ruptures. The blood accumulates to compress the surrounding brain cells, leading to brain tissue damage and neurological deficits. According to American Stroke Association, hemorrhagic strokes occupy about 13% of all strokes consisting of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — bleeding into the brain parenchyma — and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Mortality and morbidity are high for hemorrhagic stroke while identifying risk factors of the hemorrhagic stroke helps detect and modify the risk, potentially reducing the odds of death or disability of the fatal disease. Identifying risk factors of the hemorrhagic stroke helps detect and modify the risk, potentially reducing the odds of death or disability of the fatal disease.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) describes the average size and volume of erythrocytes circulating in the bloodstream. It is calculated by dividing the hematocrit by the concentration of erythrocytes (hematocrit × 10/red blood cell count [millions/mm³ blood]). Red blood cell distribution width (RCDW) is defined as one standard deviation (SD) of erythrocyte volume divided by the MCV (SD/MCV × 100) and is used to measure the heterogeneity of red blood cell size. Therefore, RCDW and MCV are correlated biologically. RCDW could be a strong predictor of the risk and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Similarly, MCV can be used to calculate the mortality and morbidity rates of ischemic stroke. RCDW and MCV are often used to diagnose hematological system diseases, such as iron-deficiency anemia and bone marrow dysfunction. They help determine the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring after surgery or blood transfusions. Increases in RCDW can be observed more easily as MCV tends to remain at low levels; RCDW and stroke are generally associated with a group of patients with low MCV.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^0d38493f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The association of RDW and complicated hospitalization

Ninety five (55.6%) patients with complicated hospitalization had increased RDW as compared with 123 (26%) patients with uncomplicated admissions (P < 0.0001).

Complicated hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the WBC count (Figure 1); the complicated hospitalization rate was 15.7% in patients with normal RDW and WBC and 20.3% in patients with only abnormal WBC count, as compared with 33.3% in patients with elevated RDW alone (P = 0.001) and 51.2% in patients with combined abnormal leukocyte count and increased RDW (P < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1, the 90-day mortality was higher in patients with elevated RDW regardless of the WBC count; however, once again the combination of abnormal WBC and elevated RDW was significantly associated with the highest mortality rates.

In order to rule out the possibility that RDW effect on severe morbidity and mortality was unrelated to anemia, we compared complicated hospitalization in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 110 g/L and higher levels of Hb. The two groups were examined in patients with normal and elevated RDW. As depicted in Figure 2, patients with normal RDW had no difference in severe morbidity or mortality regardless of Hb levels. On the other hand, elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in both complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective of Hb levels.

### Prognostic value of red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio for predicting mortality in adult patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria in intensive care units [^1b48c0eb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics across quartile of RAR

Tables 3 and 4 list the characteristics of all the participants in this study. In the entire cohort, the median RAR was 5.28%/g/dl. The ranges of RAR levels were 0–4.339%/g/dl, 4.340–5.279%/g/dl, 5.280–6.779%/g/dl, and > 6.779%/g/dl in quartile 1 (Q1), quartile 2 (Q2), quartile 3 (Q3), and quartile 4 (Q4), respectively. Some clinical characteristics showed significant linear trends across the RAR quartiles (P for trend < 0.05). Patients in Q4 had higher levels of AST, PT, and APTT but lower levels of calcium and hemoglobin than those in Q1. Chronic renal disease and chronic hepatitis were substantially more prevalent in people with a high RAR than those with a low RAR. Consistent with the expected trends, the in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality rates were considerably greater in individuals with a high RAR than those with a low RAR (all P < 0.001; all P for trend < 0.001).

### Red cell distribution width is associated with cardiovascular risk and disease parameters in rheumatoid arthritis [^95be10d3]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Since red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease and inflammation in several conditions, the main aim of this study was to evaluate its prognostic value in RA patients and its potential associations with clinical features.

Methods

The history of CV events was retrospectively reviewed in 160 RA patients and RDW was recorded at disease onset and 6 and 12 months after diagnosis to calculate the accumulated value [area under the curve (AUC) RDW] and change during the first year (ΔRDW). In addition, RDW was analysed in 110 patients with established disease in relation to clinical features.

Results

Increased RDW at diagnosis and AUC RDW were able to predict the occurrence of CV events in RA patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.247 (95% CI 1.079, 1.441), P = 0.003 and HR 1.038 (95% CI 1.018, 1.059), P = 0.0001, respectively] after adjusting by potential confounding factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed a better power of discrimination for the AUC RDW (P = 3.394 × 10⁻⁵). In addition, an increase in RDW during the first year was associated with poor CV outcome (P = 0.010). On the other hand, RDW in patients with established RA was significantly associated with disease activity, acute phase reactants and severity.

Conclusion

RDW at disease onset may be used as an early marker of CV risk in RA, whereas in patients with established disease it was related to the activity of the disease. These findings suggest that RDW can be considered as a surrogate marker of inflammation and, consequently, CV risk in RA patients.

### Multiplicative interaction between mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in predicting mortality of elderly patients with and without anemia [^f04b9eab]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) is an important predictor of adverse outcomes. However, the strength of this biomarker has not been tested in a large outpatient elderly population. Also since increased RDW can be due to a variety of etiologies, additional biomarkers are needed to refine the prognostic value of this variable. We assembled a cohort of 36,226 elderly (≥ 65yo) patients seen at an outpatient facility within the Einstein/Montefiore system from January 1st 1997 to May 1st 2008 who also had a complete blood count performed within 3 months of the initial visit. With a maximum follow-up of 10 years, we found that an elevated RDW (> 16.6) was associated with increased risk of mortality in both non-anemic (HR = 3.66, p < 0.05) and anemic patients (HR = 1.87, p < 0.05). The effect of RDW on mortality is significantly increased in non-anemic patients with macrocytosis (HR = 5.22, p < 0.05) compared to those with normocytosis (HR = 3.86, p < 0.05) and microcytosis (HR = 2.46, p < 0.05). When comparing non-anemic patients with both an elevated RDW and macrocytosis to those with neither, we observed an elevated HR of 7.76 (higher than expected in an additive model). This multiplicative interaction was not observed in anemic patients (HR = 2.23). Lastly, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each RDW/MCV subgroup and found worsened survival for those with macrocytosis and an elevated RDW in both anemia and non-anemic patients. Based on our results, the addition of MCV appears to improve the prognostic value of RDW as a predictor of overall survival in elderly patients.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^9490bd71]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Kim et al. demonstrated that indicators of iron deficiency anemia, especially ferritin, were highly associated with coronary artery abnormalities. Kuo et al. showed that inflammation-induced hepcidin is associated with anemia development and outcomes in patients with KD. High levels of hepcidin lead to a low serum iron content and limit availability of iron for erythropoiesis, resulting in an increase in RDW. However, no indices reflecting iron metabolism were available in our study; therefore, we were unable to confirm a relationship between RDW and iron metabolism. We found that patients with KD and CALs had a lower mean erythrocyte volume, which may indirectly reflect iron deficiency. Thus, impaired iron mobilization may be a pathophysiological mechanism of the association between increased RDW and CALs.

Nonetheless, several limitations hindered our study. First, this was a retrospective study; therefore, selection bias may exist. Second, due to lack of height data, CALs were assessed according to absolute coronary artery diameter rather than mean BSA-adjusted Z-score. In addition, due to the limited sample size, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of CAL severity. Third, despite adjusting for multiple variables, it is possible that other residual confounding variables influenced the results, such as iron, folate, and vitamin B12. Finally, although an association between an increase in RDW and presence of CALs in patients with KD was established in the present study, whether RDW has a causal role in CAL development or whether it acts as a marker of the disease process needs further investigation.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^1fb66ee5]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Other studies found the sensitivity of RDW to be very high (96–100%) in detecting iron deficiency anemia. On the contrary, there is a report of a limited specificity of RDW for diagnosis of IDA among children with microcytic hypochromic anemia. At a cut-off value of 17.4%, as obtained from the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of RDW in diagnosis of IDA were 81.0% and 53.4% and a positive and negative predictive value of 63.0% and 72.2%, respectively.

One of the other approaches used to predict IDA is the use of indexes such as Mentzler's, discriminant function, Srivastava's, Shine and Lal's, MCV/MCH indices which are based on many hematological parameters instead of one. In our study also, when we used Hb and RDW together the sensitivity and specificity improved considerably with high positive and negative predictive values. These data suggest that the combined approach of using Hb ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15% (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 90.5% and negative predictive value of 98.9%) performs well obviating the need for using expensive biochemical tests for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia in a low resource setting.

### The relationship between red blood cell distribution width and islet β-cell function indexes in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^58ab5b72]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between red blood cell distribution and islet β-cell function indexes in patients with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults.

Methods

A total of 487 LADA patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Patients were divided into three groups according to RDW tertiles. Clinical and laboratory measurements of age, height, weight, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, RDW, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C-peptide and blood lipids were performed. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) were assessed using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) based on fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting C-peptide index (FCP). Correlations and multiple linear regressions were implemented to determine the association of RDW and islet function indexes.

Results

As the increase of serum RDW level, the presence of β-cell secretion increased(P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that there were significant correlations between RDW and male sex, age, duration, TG, Cr, FCP, and HOMA-β in all subjects. Multiple linear regressions indicated that RDW was significantly correlated with HOMA-β in the total population in both unadjusted and adjusted analysis. This finding could be reproduced in the subgroup of low GAD titers for HOMA-β. RDW were significantly associated with HbA1c in LADA patients with high GAD titers, but the correlation was not found in subgroup with low GAD titers in either unadjusted analyses or adjusted analysis.

Conclusions

RDW is associated with β-cell function assessed by HOMA-β after adjusting for covariates in LADA patients with low GAD titers.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^50534230]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of RDW with major composite CV outcomes and mortality in patients with CKD. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower LVEF levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels, and higher serum creatinine levels compared with the normal RDW group. RDW levels exhibited a graded increase across different stages of CKD. RDW ≥ 14.5% was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes and a trend toward higher mortality. A greater than 2-fold risk of major composite CV outcomes was observed in the elevated RDW group (HR = 2.581, CI = 1.541–4.322, P < .001). Age and impaired LVEF were additional covariates that were independent predictors of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. The incidence of outcomes is higher than that reported in a previous study, because our patients were confirmed to have CAD.

Patients with higher RDW levels are often considered to have erythropoietic stress. In the general population, patients with higher RDW levels are likely to be older and have smoking habits, higher body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, lower mean corpuscular volume, and higher serum creatinine levels. Elevated RDW was correlated with higher serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a larger left atrium, and lower LVEF values in patients with CV risk. RDW levels were also positively associated with C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and fibrinogen and negatively associated with albumin levels. Consequently, RDW was supposed to be a marker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

The pathophysiology of elevated RDW toward unfavorable CV outcomes has not been elucidated. Anemia and elevated serum creatinine, commonly occurring in patients with CKD, were risk factors for CV events. Our results reveal that the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes was independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, which have reported that the level of RDW, even within the normal reference range, was associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality irrespective of anemia, ferritin levels, and renal impairment. There should be other explanations for the poor prognostic effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. Two novel risk factors for CV events, oxidative stress and inflammation, could be possible underlying mechanisms.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^6c7840db]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is caused by the immunologic incompatibility of the blood type of the mother and child, which can result in anemia and jaundice in children. If it cannot be treated effectively in time, severe jaundice can be secondary to bilirubin encephalopathy, which can cause severe nervous system damage. As such, we must pay more attention to the early screening of HDN, which is very important for guiding the treatment plan and improving the prognosis of the patient. The hemolytic nature of HDN is described as the abnormal destruction and decomposition of red blood cells, causing heterogeneous manifestations such as abnormal red blood cell volume and morphology. The application of red blood cell morphology in the identification of hemolytic jaundice has been reported in the literature. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), the results of which are more objective and accurate than morphology, are commonly used parameters related to red blood cell volume. At present, the antibody screening of pregnant women is not routinely carried out. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) is routinely monitored among newborns in clinical practice. According to the changes in its level, three hemolysis tests are carried out to confirm HDN, but the tests take a long time; If the TSB level is low, HDN diagnosis may be missed. This study aims to explore the early changes of MCV and RDW in children with HDN, combined with bilirubin detection, to improve the efficiency of HDN diagnosis during hospitalization and reduce readmission rate.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of coeliac disease: a prospective study [^b7a93910]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Coeliac disease is frequently underdiagnosed because of its protean presentations. Serological tests may be helpful in screening programmes for populations at risk, but they are costly.

Aim

To determine prospectively whether a commonly available haematological test such as the red cell distribution width (RDW) could be of help in detecting unrecognized coeliac disease.

Methods

Of 353 consecutive adult patients referred to our outpatient malabsorption clinic, 198 in whom clinical suspicion was strong were referred for further investigations and intestinal biopsy. Seventy-six inflammatory bowel disease outpatients and 90 subjects admitted for diseases other than malabsorption were enrolled as the control group.

Results

RDW was increased in 94 (47.4%) and normal in 104 (52.5%) of 198 patients. Duodenal biopsy confirmed coeliac disease in 80 (85.1%) of the former patients and 69 (66.3%) of the latter patients. No correlation between RDW values and histological scores was found. Overall RDW increase was found in 80/149 (53.7%) patients with a definite diagnosis of coeliac disease, and in 14/49 (28.6%) patients in whom biopsy excluded the disease. A 1-year gluten withdrawal led to a significant decrease in RDW value, even in patients with obdurate mucosal impairment.

Conclusions

In patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of coeliac disease, an elevated RDW despite normal haemoglobin concentration may be a reliable predictor of the disease.

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in tuberculosis combined with other bacterial infections [^7524c430]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a common infectious disease of the lungs caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb infected one-third of the population in 2021, producing disease in approximately 10% and killing 1.6 million people. Co-infections involving tuberculosis(TB) and bacterial pathogens have been reported, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of TB. There is a significant increase in susceptibility to PTB and the risk of death among individuals aged 65 and over. Elderly patients with PTB have poor physique, low immunity, and chronic consumption of PTB, so they are more likely to be complicated by pulmonary bacterial infection. Distinguishing between TB and co-infections involving bacterial pathogens presents a significant clinical challenge. Failure to differentiate these conditions may result in poorer health outcomes, including increased healthcare costs, antimicrobial resistance, and higher mortality rates. Clinical observations indicate that PTB is often complicated with pulmonary bacterial infections, but they are difficult to identify using conventional diagnostic methods. This is especially true for patients with bacterial-negative PTB, which presents diagnostic challenges due to atypical imaging findings and prominent fever, along with abnormal laboratory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer(DD), and white blood cell count(WBC). Currently, diagnosis is primarily based on empirical anti-infective treatment or a combination of anti-tuberculosis and anti-infective therapies, followed by assessment of lesion absorption through chest X-ray and computed tomography scans. This approach may result in irrational use of drugs use and delayed patient recovery. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for TB. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) have been identified as emerging biomarkers for evaluating the severity of inflammation. Given that these ratios are easily and rapidly measured, a growing number of studies have focused on these indicators. Significant alterations in NLR, FAR, and RDW have been well-documented in various common acute and chronic diseases, including neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases. These biomarkers have garnered attention as potential diagnostic indicators capable of aiding in risk assessment and clinical decision-making. However, fewer studies have systematically examined the value of NLR, FAR, and RDW in the differential diagnosis of TB with concurrent bacterial infection. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the diagnostic value of NLR, FAR, and RDW in patients with TB and concurrent bacterial infection, and to provide a more accurate and reliable foundation for the differential diagnosis and individualized treatment of these patients.

### Prognostic value of red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume on mortality in hemodialysis patients [^058a1ad5]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are principally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Limited evidence is available for its prognostic value for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to definite the relationship between RDW and MCV and mortality in HD patients.

Method

This cohort study examined all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with 181 maintenance HD patients from February 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the median of RDW and MCV. Pearson analysis was conducted to determine the related factors of RDW and MCV. The independent association of RDW and MCV with mortality was examined with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.

Results

This study included 181 HD patients for a median follow-up of 71months. We found RDW was positively related to neutrophil count, C-reaction protein, and ferritin, while negatively related to hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. Only neutrophil count and ferritin were significantly related to MCV in this study. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high RDW group was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 3.787; 95% confidence interval, 1.037 to 13.834; p = 0.044). The relationship between RDW and MCV and CV mortality was not significant.

Conclusions

RDW could emerge as an additive risk factor for all-cause mortality in maintenance HD patients, independent of other factors. An absolute value of MCV to predict mortality and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms should be confirmed in the future.

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in tuberculosis combined with other bacterial infections [^6b288b73]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the NLR, FAR and RDW indicators have some clinical reference value for the differential diagnosis of PTB combined with other bacterial infection complication. Additionally, the diagnostic value of the three combined tests is higher. Clinicians should closely monitor the changes in the NLR, FAR and RDW indexes to reduce the misdiagnosis rate and omission rate, increase the understanding of the disease condition of the patient, and to provide reference for the clinical use of drugs.

### The association between hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio and asthma and asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^dc94e031]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, characterized by reversible airway constriction and hyperresponsiveness. Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database indicates that in 2019, approximately 262 million people were affected by asthma, with its incidence continuing to rise. One of the most severe consequences of asthma is exacerbation, also known as an asthma attack, which results in a substantial number of emergency department visits. This imposes a significant burden on global healthcare resources and the economy. Therefore, identifying accessible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive biomarkers for asthma and its exacerbations holds significant clinical value.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters have become valuable tools in asthma research in recent years due to their non-invasive nature, affordability, and accessibility. Among them, eosinophil count is recognized as a key biomarker of asthma-related inflammation, with elevated levels often associated with disease exacerbation and chronic inflammation. However, eosinophil count exhibits limited sensitivity at low levels, restricting its predictive utility across all asthma patients. Additionally, RDW an indicator of erythrocyte volume heterogeneity, has been linked to systemic inflammation and hypoxic conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated its association with the prevalence and mortality of several inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatic diseases, sepsis, and heart failure. Similarly, hemoglobin (HGB) primarily functions as an oxygen transport molecule and is widely used as a key biochemical marker for diagnosing anemia.

The HRR is an innovative composite biomarker that integrates HGB and RDW, providing comprehensive information on oxygen transport and inflammation. HRR was initially introduced in cancer research, and has since been demonstrated to be associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, offering greater comprehensiveness and reliability compared to HGB or RDW alone. HRR is influenced by both its components: hemoglobin levels can be altered by anemia, chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or hypoxia, while RDW tends to increase under conditions of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, or disrupted erythropoiesis. These factors make HRR a composite marker that captures both oxygen transport capacity and systemic inflammatory burden. Compared to RDW or HGB alone, HRR may offer improved stability and interpretability in reflecting chronic inflammatory conditions. Therefore, HRR may serve as an integrative marker reflecting both oxygen delivery and inflammatory burden.

Given the complex pathological characteristics of asthma and the interplay between systemic inflammation and hypoxia, we hypothesize that HRR may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease status in asthma patients. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HRR, asthma, and asthma exacerbations.

### Progressive rise in red cell distribution width is associated with disease progression in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [^5b0571b6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Single red cell distribution width (RDW) assessment is a consistent prognostic marker of poor outcomes in heart failure as well as in other patient cohorts. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of sequential RDW assessment in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

We reviewed 6,159 consecutive ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure between 2001–2006 and examined changes in RDW values from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Clinical, demographic, laboratory, and ICD-9 coding data were extracted from electronic health records, and all-cause mortality was followed over a mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 2.4 years. In this study cohort, median baseline RDW was 14.9%. RDW > 16% at baseline (18.5% of cohort) was associated with a higher mortality rates than RDW ≤ 16%. For each +1% increment of baseline RDW, the risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.19; P < .0001). At 12-month follow-up (n = 1,601), a large majority of subjects (68% in first tertile, 56% in second tertile of baseline RDW) showed rising RDW and correspondingly higher risk for all-cause mortality (risk ratio for +1% increase in changes in RDW was 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13; P = 0.001). This effect was independent of anemia status or other baseline cardiac or renal indices, and particularly strong in those with lower baseline RDW.

Conclusions

In our ambulatory cohort of patients with chronic heart failure, baseline and serial increases in RDW were associated with poor long-term outcomes independently from standard cardiac, hematologic, and renal indices.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^974454d7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationships between red cell distribution width (RDW), other inflammation-related markers and clinical features with the clinical and radiological severity of diverticulitis.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 250 patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis. Radiological diverticulitis severity was determined by the Hinchey classification. Clinical diverticulitis severity was determined based on the treatment applied (invasive versus conservative/medical treatment).

Results

High platelet count (p = 0.001) and high CRP (p < 0.001) were independently associated with the Hinchey Class II-IV. Need for invasive treatment was independently associated with presence of Hinchey stage II-IV (p < 0.001) and high (> 13.75) RDW (p < 0.001). With a cut-off value of > 13.75, RDW was able to predict patients requiring invasive treatment [Sensitivity = 75.86%, Specificity = 63.87%, AUC (95% CI) = 0.657 (0.580–0.734), p < 0.001].

Conclusiosn

RDW, which is an inexpensive and readily-available parameter, may be a supportive measure in the prediction of the clinical severity of diverticulitis. Together with other clinical and laboratory data, RDW could help identify patients with worse prognosis, facilitating appropriate decisions and precautions in their management.

### Could red cell distribution width be used for predicting cardiac injury in neonates with COVID-19? [^49dbd893]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect people of all age groups and it can occasionally cause life-threatening clinical illnesses in immunologically immature populations, especially in newborns. High red cell distribution width (RDW) values were used as an early prognostic biomarker of some neonatal diseases. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of RDW in severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected neonates.

Methods

Newborns with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a nasopharyngeal swab sample, who had refractory fever (> 38°C and lasting more than 24h during hospitalization), were screened for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in newborns (MIS-N), systemic inflammatory indexes calculated and cardiologic evaluations. Due to troponin levels (high: > 45ng/L and low: ≤ 45ng/L) patients were grouped.

Results

Out of the 68 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive newborns, 26 patients had refractory fever. Comparison of laboratory findings between the high and low-troponin groups showed that RDW and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio values were significantly higher in patients with high troponin levels (p = 0.022 and p = 0.030, respectively). The cut-off values with optimal sensitivity and specificity were determined as 1.00 for neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.205) and 16.6 for RDW (p = 0.014). None of the patients died.

Conclusions

Neonatal COVID-19 generally has a benign prognosis, but can progress to severe disease and cases of MIS-N are rare. RDW could be prognostic in the diagnosis and management of neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection with high troponin levels.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^5356f398]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the presence of diverticulosis, the lifetime risk of diverticulitis ranges from 10 to 25%, demonstrating the need for inexpensive tools to assess risks in these patients. Identifying and classifying patients with acute diverticulitis for medical or surgical treatment is crucial. Recent studies have explored ways to further classify management, such as distinguishing patients who can be treated as outpatients from those who require inpatient care. Accurately predicting the initial severity of the disease is essential for safely categorizing patients according to their treatment needs. Investigating the utility of readily available and inexpensive parameters routinely used in clinical practice is a reliable approach to address such challenges. Due to their wide recognition among physicians and well-established use scenarios, these parameters may be used safely and easily to predict the clinical severity and prognosis of acute diverticulitis. In this study, comorbidity, high WBC, and high CRP were independent predictors of radiologically severe diverticulitis, while Stage II-IV Hinchey class and high RDW were independent predictors of clinically severe diverticulitis. CRP showed the highest positive correlation with radiological severity. RDW predicted the need for invasive treatment with 75.86% sensitivity and 63.87% specificity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a significant relationship between RDW and diverticulitis severity, as well as its predictive value for surgical or interventional treatment. Although RDW was statistically associated with the need for invasive treatment, its moderate sensitivity and specificity limit its clinical value as a standalone biomarker. It is more appropriate to consider RDW as a supplementary indicator that may support clinical judgment when combined with radiological and laboratory findings.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^f74d9e11]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current strategy to identify iron deficiency anemia relies on markers involving high costs. Reports have suggested red cell distribution width (RDW) as a potential screening test for identifying iron deficiency anemia (IDA) but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Our study elucidates the discriminative ability of RDW for detecting IDA among young children.

Methods

2091 blood reports of children aged 1–3 years from an urban low socio-economic population of Delhi were analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity of RDW in discriminating IDA using receiver's operating characteristic curve. Hemoglobin and RDW were estimated using coulter, zinc protoporphyrin with AVIV fluorometer and serum ferritin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

A total of 1026 samples were classified as iron deficient anemia using gold standard. As a marker of overall efficiency, area under the curve for RDW was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81–0.84; p < 0.001). Sensitivity of RDW at cut-off of 18% to detect iron deficiency anemia was 76.5% and specificity 73.1% yielding a positive predictive value of 73% and negative predictive value of 76%. At a cut-off of RDW 16.4%, the sensitivity was 94% and at a cut-off of 21%, the specificity was 95%. Combination of hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15%, yielded a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%. These data suggest that simple coulter analysis estimating hemoglobin and RDW can be used for identification of children in need for iron therapy.

Conclusions

In India and similar settings, RDW > 15% with hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL identifies iron deficient anemic children without need for iron status markers which could help reduce cost of management especially in poor settings.

### Prognostic significance of red cell distribution width in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [^5b41235d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is routinely assessed as part of the complete blood count (CBC) to gather information on the heterogeneity in the size of circulating erythrocytes. RDW is a more sensitive screening marker for anemia, inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies. The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic value of RDW in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of data from 148 ESCC consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative esophagectomy and analyzed the correlation of RDW with various clinicopathological factors.

Results

Multivariate analyses identified a high RDW (HR, 2.061; P = 0.0286) as a significant risk factor for cancer-specific survival (CSS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test demonstrated that patients with a high RDW had a significantly worse prognosis in terms of CSS than those with a low RDW (P = 0.0011). In multivariate analysis, there was no significant relationship between RDW and CSS in pathological tumor node metastasis stage I or II patients. However, a high RDW (HR, 2.386; P = 0.0471) was confirmed to be an independent worse prognostic factor for CSS in pathological tumor node metastasis stage III cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test showed a significant relationship between RDW and CSS in patients with pathological tumor node metastasis stage III (P = 0.0175).

Conclusions

The RDW was a significant and independent predictor of poor survival in ESCC patients after curative esophagectomy. RDW may aid clinicians in detecting signs of recurrence very early and effectively customize treatment regimens. RDW is thus a convenient, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker to predict survival in ESCC.

### Relation of red cell distribution width to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and mortality in patients with and without heart failure [^efc59c35]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Higher red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). RDW is also closely associated with iron deficiency. However, the mechanism underlying this association is unclear. The relation between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and RDW has not been studied, especially in those without HF. We examined the relation between LVEDP and RDW in 1,084 consecutive stable patients who underwent elective coronary angiography. We observed that 38% had high LVEDP (> 16 mm Hg) and 29% had history of HF. The median RDW was 13.4%, which was higher with increasing LVEDP (p < 0.0001) and significantly higher in patients with HF (p < 0.0001). Baseline RDW were independently associated with high LVEDP even after multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per unit change 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 1.29, p = 0.044). Interestingly, result were stronger in non-HF cohort (adjusted OR per unit change 1.37, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.67, p = 0.001). In addition, elevated (third vs first tertiles) RDW levels were independently a predictor of high LVEDP and were associated with a 4.8-fold increased 5-year mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 4.11, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.96, p < 0.0001), even with the addition of B-type natriuretic peptide to the model (adjusted OR for LVEDP 2.25, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.05, p = 0.05; adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 3.79, 95% CI 1.033 to 13.89, p = 0.044, respectively). In conclusion, high RDW levels were observed in patients with or without HF and independently associated with high LVEDP and with mortality.

### The value of shear wave elastography combined with red blood cell distribution width in evaluating arterial erectile dysfunction [^4289abfc]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The erection process is an intricate neurovascular process that involves the coordination of the neurological, endocrine, psychological and circulatory systems. The inability of a man to achieve and/or sustain a penile erection that is sufficient for sexual engagement and for an acceptable sexual performance is known as erectile dysfunction(ED). ED can be classified as being psychogenic, organic (i.e. neurogenic, hormonal, arterial, cavernous, or drug-induced), or a mixture of psychogenic and organic. Vascular variables are crucial in organic ED because of the microcirculation of the penile corpus cavernosum (CCP). Arterial ED(AED), venous ED, and mixed ED are the three subtypes of vascular ED, with AED being the most prevalent.

The diagnosis of ED is therefore very complex, a process that requires differentiating among types of ED and identifying the causes, associated risk factors and potential life-threatening comorbidities. At present, it is mainly diagnosed through history taking, physical examination, laboratory assessment, and specific investigations.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is one of the quantitative parameters of routine complete blood cells and reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cells. It is a typical marker for differential diagnosis of different types of anemia. Recent studies have shown that RDW can be used as an independent diagnostic marker to predict cardiovascular diseases(CVD) (e.g. hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary syndrome), tumours, metabolic syndromes and inflammatory diseases. As a condition intimately associated with cardiovascular factors, some scholars believe that ED is an early symptom of subclinical CVD or even an independent marker. According to the association between ED and CVD, we hypothesized that clinically pertinent hematological parameters that can be used to predict or evaluate CVD would also be applicable to ED.

The features of shear wave elastography (SWE) include non-invasion quantification, convenience and high repeatability. SWE has been widely investigated to estimating thyroid, breast, and liver mass stiffness. A number of previous researches have investigated the feasibility of using SWE to quantitatively evaluate CCP stiffness for the diagnosis of ED. SWE provides noninvasive quantitative data on CCP stiffness and its change with age, as demonstrated by Inci et al. Hu et al found that compared with normal tissues, two-dimensional SWE can differentiate CCP lesions secondary to hyperlipidemia by quantifying elastic quantitative values.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^9b94a211]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In the study, it was also found that in the group with MCV > 96.35fL or RDW-CV > 16.05%, the probability of anemia in children was higher (20.3%vs36.5%, 22.0%vs36.5%, respectively). A few children underwent emergency blood transfusion to treat anemia symptoms, and then samples were taken for three hemolysis experiments. This will affect the results of the experiments due to the consumption of blood group antibodies, which may cause missed HDN detection. There are not many of such cases in this study, and there is still a lack of sufficient observation with regards to this. We can pay more attention to the dual role of MCV and RDW-CV in blood transfusion guidance and HDN screening in such children. Additionally, the reticulocyte count often rises in hemolytic conditions. Reticulocytes are larger than mature RBC, thereby elevating the MCV, and the mixture of reticulocytes with mature RBC elevates the RDW. Therefore, reticulocytosis should continue to be observed as the underlying mechanism for the observed MCV and RDW elevations. This study did not include cases diagnosed with suspected HDN and those with multiple causes of jaundice, such as HDN with premature delivery, infection, G6PD deficiency, etc. Thus, this study can continue to expand the data used to improve the comparison.

### Prognostic value of hemoglobin to red blood cell distribution width ratio in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a retrospective study [^b28f9d05]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have identified the hemoglobin (Hb) to red blood cell distribution width (RDW) ratio (HRR) is associated with the prognosis of a variety of malignant tumors. However, the relationship between HRR and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prognosis remains unexplored. This study aims to ascertain the prognostic significance of HRR in PDAC patients.

Methods

In a retrospective analysis, 128 PDAC patients undergoing initial surgical resection at Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital between January 2016 and September 2021 were included. Based on receiver operating characteristic curve-derived cut-off values, participants were categorized into low and high HRR groups. The correlation between HRR and patient prognosis was subsequently examined.

Results

Significant disparities in age, Hb levels, RDW, tumor locality, surgical intervention, and postoperative chemotherapy were observed between the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the low HRR cohort exhibited inferior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates (P = 0.002 for both). Univariate analysis indicated that male gender, adjacent tissue invasion, TNM stages III/IV, non-O blood types, low HRR, and lack of postoperative chemotherapy were linked to adverse DFS and OS outcomes (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis further delineated low HRR as an independent predictor of poor DFS and OS outcomes (HR: 1.520, 95% CI: 1.028–2.247, P = 0.036; HR: 1.537, 95% CI: 1.034–2.284, P = 0.034, respectively).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that a lower HRR is indicative of poorer DFS and OS in PDAC patients, underscoring its potential utility as a prognostic biomarker for this population.

### Association between red cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio and short-term mortality in patients with sepsis-associated delirium: a retrospective study from the MIMIC-IV database [^07c4b08f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

General information

Overall, 4021 patients diagnosed with SAD, aged 65.0 ± 16.2 years, were included in the analysis, with males comprising 58% of the sample. In this cohort, the overall prevalence of ICU 30-day mortality was 29.7% (Table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics before propensity score matching

Data are weighted estimates, and values are presented as means ± standard deviation or means (percentage). HR, heart rate; SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; Inr, International Normalized Ratio; Rdw, red blood cell distribution width; SAPS II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; LODS, Logistic Organ Dysfunction System; OASIS, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score; WBC, white blood cell; RAR, red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio; RRT, renal replacement therapy. Antibiotic, time: time from ICU admission to antibiotic initiation

ROC curve analysis for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with SAD yielded an optimal RAR cutoff threshold of 5.85, with an AUC of 0.635 (95% CI, 0.617–0.653; P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Patients with SAD were divided into low RAR group (RAR < 5.85) and high RAR group (RAR ≧ 5.85) (Table 1).

Compared to the low RAR group, the high RAR group exhibited a higher proportion of females and elevated proportions of severe liver disease, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and malignant cancer. Moreover, in this group, increased proportions were observed for heart rate and various special scores, while blood pressure and body temperature were lower (both P < 0.05). The high-RAR group displayed significantly elevated levels of INR, RDW, and WBC indicators compared to the low-RAR group (P < 0.05), whereas albumin, sodium, calcium, hemoglobin, platelet, and glucose levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the high-RAR group. Compared with the low-RAR group, the high-RAR group showed a decreased proportion of mechanical ventilation usage and an increased proportion of RRT, as well as elevated in-hospital mortality, ICU 30-day mortality, and ICU 90-day mortality (both P < 0.05) (Table 1).

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^f9164818]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1b1605bb]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) represents a chronic lung disease with unpredictable course.

Methods

We aimed to investigate prognostic performance of complete blood count parameters in IPF. Treatment-naïve patients with IPF were retrospectively enrolled from two independent cohorts (derivation and validation) and split into subgroups (high and low) based on median baseline monocyte count and red cell distribution width (RDW).

Results

Overall, 489 patients (derivation cohort: 300, validation cohort: 189) were analyzed. In the derivation cohort, patients with monocyte count ≥ 0.60 K/μL had significantly lower median FVC%pred [75.0, (95% CI 71.3–76.7) vs. 80.9, (95% CI 77.5–83.1), (P = 0.01)] and DLCO%pred [47.5, (95% CI 44.3–52.3) vs. 53.0, (95% CI 48.0–56.7), (P = 0.02)] than patients with monocyte count < 0.60 K/μL. Patients with RDW ≥ 14.1% had significantly lower median FVC%pred [75.5, (95% CI 71.2–79.2) vs. 78.3, (95% CI 76.0–81.0), (P = 0.04)] and DLCO%pred [45.4, (95% CI 43.3–50.5) vs. 53.0, (95% CI 50.8–56.8), (P = 0.008)] than patients with RDW < 14.1%. Cut-off thresholds from the derivation cohort were applied to the validation cohort with similar discriminatory value, as indicated by significant differences in median DLCO%pred between patients with high vs. low monocyte count [37.8, (95% CI 35.5–41.1) vs. 45.5, (95% CI 41.9–49.4), (P < 0.001)] and RDW [37.9, (95% CI 33.4–40.7) vs. 44.4, (95% CI 41.5–48.9), (P < 0.001)]. Patients with high monocyte count and RDW of the validation cohort exhibited a trend towards lower median FVC%pred (P = 0.09) and significantly lower median FVC%pred (P = 0.001), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis in the derivation cohort demonstrated higher all-cause mortality in patients with high (≥ 0.60 K/μL) vs. low monocyte count (< 0.60 K/μL) [HR 2.05, (95% CI 1.19–3.53), (P = 0.01)].

Conclusions

Increased monocyte count and RDW may represent negative prognostic biomarkers in patients with IPF.

### Elevated red cell distribution width is associated with cerebral infarction in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^b5ce9c3b]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with thrombotic disorders including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and ischemic stroke, independent of other inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elevated RDW is associated with cerebral infarction and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

Methods

In this retrospective single-center cohort of aSAH patients (October 2009-September 2014), elevated RDW was defined as a mean RDW > 14.5% during the first 14 days after aSAH. Outcomes included cerebral infarction (CI) by any mechanism and poor functional outcome, defined as discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 4, indicating severe disability or death.

Results

Of 179 patients, 27% had a high Hunt-Hess grade (IV-V), and 76% were women. Twenty-four patients (13.4%) underwent red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and compared to patients with normal RDW, patients with an elevated RDW were at greater odds of RBC transfusion (OR 2.56 [95% CI, 1.07–6.11], p = 0.035). In univariate analysis, more patients with elevated RDW experienced CI (30.8 vs. 13.7%, p = 0.017). In the multivariable model, elevated RDW was significantly associated with CI (OR 3.08 [95% CI, 1.30–7.32], p = 0.011), independent of known confounders including but not limited to age, sex, race, high Hunt-Hess grade, and RBC transfusion. In multivariable analysis, RDW elevation was also associated with poor functional outcome (mRS > 4) at discharge (OR 2.59 [95% CI, 1.04–629], p = 0.040).

Conclusions

RDW elevation is associated with cerebral infarction and poor outcome after aSAH. Further evaluation of this association is warranted as it may shed light on mechanistic relations between anemia, inflammation, and thrombosis after aSAH.

### Red cell distribution width in heart failure: prediction of clinical events and relationship with markers of ineffective erythropoiesis, inflammation, renal function, and nutritional state [^100a1232]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to independently validate the recent observations on the predictive role of red cell distribution width (RDW) for outcomes in chronic heart failure and to provide epidemiologic data on the biological correlates of RDW in heart failure (HF). Understanding the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear, largely hampered by the lack of epidemiologic studies demonstrating factors that are associated with anisocytosis in cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

One hundred ninety-five patients (145 men, 50 women) with systolic HF were enrolled and followed up for a median of 14.5 months. Primary end points were all-cause mortality and hospital readmission due to worsening HF symptoms. A total of 19 clinical chemistry, hematology, and biochemical variables were considered for analysis together with clinical parameters in Cox proportional hazards and multiple regression models.

Results

Red cell distribution width was found to be an N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide independent predictor of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.61 per 1 SD increase) in our study. Multiple correlations between biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis (serum iron, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor levels), inflammation and acute-phase reaction (interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I and soluble TNF receptor II, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin concentrations), undernutrition (total cholesterol and albumin levels), and renal function were observed. In the multiple regression model, the strongest relationship for RDW was obtained with soluble transferrin receptor, soluble TNF receptor I, soluble TNF receptor II, and total cholesterol.

Conclusions

Here we validate the strong, independent prediction of morbidity and mortality in HF by RDW. The described correlations between RDW and inflammation, ineffective erythropoiesis, undernutrition, and impaired renal function may facilitate the understanding why this marker is associated with adverse outcomes in HF.

### A study of red cell distribution width in neonatal sepsis [^816b72e1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate a new nontraditional value of the red cell distribution width (RDW) in predicting the clinical outcome of neonatal sepsis.

Methods

In this retrospective study, data were collected from the medical files of 500 full-term neonates with a diagnosis of early onset or late onset sepsis. Baseline RDW and other traditional biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), total leucocytic count, and platelet count were analyzed in light of the clinical data. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality.

Results

Red cell distribution width was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P < 0.0001). Red cell distribution width was significantly elevated in infants with septic shock compared with those having severe sepsis and those with sepsis (P < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation was found between RDW and CRP (r = 0.8; P < 0.0001). Red cell distribution width had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 for prediction of mortality, which was almost equal to that of CRP and platelet count. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed a positive association of RDW with mortality (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.241–1.399).

Conclusions

Red cell distribution width is a useful prognostic marker in neonatal sepsis. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm the value of this routinely available marker in this category of patients.

### Importance of RDW value in differential diagnosis of hypochrome anemias [^51619e83]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in adults carrying delta-beta thalassemia traits (deltabeta-TT) who were 20–40 years of age (n = 29), beta thalassemia traits (beta-TT) with an age range of 18–60 years (n = 49), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in individuals aged 1–18 years (n = 27), and in controls with an age range of 20–40 years (n = 20). Although red blood cell count, MCV, and MCH values showed no statistically significant differences between deltabeta-TT and beta-TT, the mean RDW value was significantly higher in deltabeta-TT (20.14 ± 1.21) compared to beta-TT (14.88 ± 1.77) (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between the means of RDW in deltabeta-TT and IDA (18.00 ± 1.94) (P > 0.05). A significant rise in RDW in IDA 5–7 days after initiation of iron therapy (P = 0.00) which was continued to rise up to the 4(th) week of therapy was suggested as an important tool in differentiation of IDA from deltabeta-TT. These observations could be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of deltabeta-TT from beta-TT and IDA by determining the red blood cell count, red cell indices, and RDW only.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Red blood cell indices and development of hospital-acquired anemia during acute myocardial infarction [^9a566e6a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired anemia (HAA) is common, often develops in the absence of bleeding, and is associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is unknown whether red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which are routinely available markers of iron deficiency, are associated with development of HAA during AMI. We studied 15,133 patients with AMI without anemia at admission. HAA was defined by nadir hemoglobin levels below age-, gender-, and race-specific thresholds and moderate-severe HAA was defined as nadir hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dl. We examined the association between low MCV (< 80 fL) and/or increased RDW (> 15%) on patients' initial complete blood cell count and moderate-severe HAA using multivariable modified Poisson regression. Moderate-severe HAA was more common in patients with high RDW and low MCV (45.5%), high RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (33.0%), and normal RDW and low MCV (28.0%) than in those with normal RDW and MCV (18.3%, p < 0.001). Compared to patients with normal RDW and MCV, those with increased RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 1.87), increased RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.42), or normal RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.65) were independently more likely to develop moderate-severe HAA. In conclusion, increased RDW and low MCV were independent predictors of moderate-severe HAA.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^f1f30ed4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width is a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count that actually reflects the degree of anisocytosis of the red blood cell population. It is a cost-effective tool used in everyday clinical practice along with other parameters to define and narrow the cause of anemia. In a series of pathologic entities, such as cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancy, chronic renal diseases and chronic respiratory diseases, where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults, red cell distribution width behaves as a significant and competent marker able to predict and assess disease activity and severity. A number of clinical studies based on these observations have aimed to evaluate its potential utility as an index of activity in inflammatory bowel disease. In this narrative review we present data from the international literature regarding its ability to express disease activity and we look into its relation with clinical, laboratory and endoscopic indices used to identify active disease. According to the results of published clinical trials, red cell distribution width is considerably correlated with disease activity and might serve as an index to differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis.

### Red blood cell distribution width / platelet ratio on admission as a predictor for in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective analysis from MIMIC-IV database [^cc2284b9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics on enrolled patients

A total of 1269 patients were enrolled in the study (Fig. 1), of which 843 (66.4%) were men. A comparison of baseline characteristics between the survivor and non-survivor groups based on prognosis within 180 days of admission to ICU was shown in Table 1. The average age of the patients was 68.8 ± 12.6 years. 83 patients died within 180 days of admission (mean length of stay: 122.4 ± 57.9 days). We found that patients in the non-survivor group had higher RPR on admission than patients in the survivor group (0.11 ± 0.07 vs. 0.08 ± 0.06, P < 0.001). In addition, other variables such as platelet, RDW, troponin T and creatinine showed significant differences between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups for concomitant disease, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac arrhythmia.

Baseline characteristics of the study population

Abbreviation: CK-MB = creatine kinase-MB; BUN = blood urea nitrogen; RPR = red blood cell distribution width/platelet ratio; RBC = red blood cell; RDW = red blood cell distribution width; MCH = mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC = mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; MCV = mean corpuscular volume; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention; CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting

Clinical outcomes

The ROC curve showed the optimal cut-off value of RPR on admission was 0.11. There were 221(17.4%) patients with RPR ≥ 0.11 on admission. Figure 2 showed KM curves for in-hospital mortality among patients stratified by RPR on admission. And we found that compared to the low RPR group, the high RPR group had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.750, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.766–4.276, P < 0.001). Figure 3 showed that the rate of in-hospital mortality of patients in high RPR group was about three times higher than that of patients with low RPR group.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^8b68d1b9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The hemolytic nature of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is described as the abnormal destruction and decomposition of red blood cells, causing heterogeneous manifestations such as abnormal red blood cell volume and morphology. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW) are commonly used parameters related to red blood cell volume. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) is routinely monitored among newborns. This study aims to explore the value of MCV and RDW, combined with TSB, to improve the efficiency of HDN diagnosis.

Methods

Three hundred eighty-eight children with HDN and 371 children with non-HDN pathological jaundice who were diagnosed and treated in the neonatal department of our hospital from January 2019 to December 2020 were included in the study. Clinical data collected include examination results of laboratory indicators, such as MCV, coefficient of variation of red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW-CV), standard deviation of red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW-SD), and TSB. The differences in the indicators between the two groups of children were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

1) The detection rate of HDN in children in the early group was higher than that in the late group (P < 0.001). 2) The early-stage group had lower TSB levels and higher values of MCV, RDW-CV and RDW-SD (P < 0.001). Compared with the children in the non-HDN group, the indices in the HDN group were higher in the early stage (P < 0.001). 3) In the early stage, the TSB, MCV, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD were positively correlated with the diagnosis of HDN (P < 0.001). Early monitoring of TSB, MCV, RDW-CV and RDW-SD was valuable for HDN detection, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.729, 0.637, 0.715, and 0.685, respectively (P < 0.001). 4) After a binary logistic analysis at TSB > 163.3 μmol/L, MCV > 96.35fL, and RDW-CV > 16.05%, the diagnosis rate of HDN increased (P < 0.001). The AUC of the HDN detected using the combined indicators was 0.841.

Conclusion

At MCV > 96.35fL or RDW-CV > 16.05%, children with jaundice in three days of birth (especially children with TSB > 163.3 μmol/L) should be screened for HDN. A combination of TSB, MCV, and RDW-CV can improve the early detection rate of HDN, contribute to reduce the readmission rate and risk of hyperbilirubinemia.

### Iron deficiency and red cell indices in patients with heart failure [^fcf2711c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure (HF) patients with normal vs. abnormal red cell indices (RCI), the associations between iron parameters and RCI, and prognostic consequences of ID independently of RCI.

Methods and Results

We analysed clinical data of 1821 patients with HF [mean age 66 ± 13 years; 71% men; New York Heart Association class I/II/III/IV (11%/39%/44%/6%); left ventricular ejection fraction > 45%: 19%]. Iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 µg/L or ferritin 100–299 µg/L with transferrin saturation < 20%) was common irrespective of the presence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL in women and < 13 g/dL in men) or low RCI, from 75% in anaemic subjects with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and MCH concentration (MCHC), to 36% in non-anaemic subjects with MCV, MCH, and MCHC above the lower limit of normal. After adjustment for clinical variables, iron parameters remained independently associated with haemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, mean reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHR), and red cell distribution width (RDW). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models there was a trend towards higher mortality in patients with vs. without ID when adjusted for relevant HF prognosticators and MCH or MCHC (but not haemoglobin, CHR or RDW).

Conclusions

Patients with HF should be routinely screened for ID irrespective of the presence of anaemia or abnormal RCI. The detrimental impact of ID on long-term survival in HF is partially independent of RCI.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^a82e5b5d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Normal RDW in basic evaluation was found in 32 patients (N group, mean RDW 13.7 ± 0.8%), elevated in 29 (E group, mean RDW 17.0 ± 2.5). The comparison between groups was shown in Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in studied parameters.

Data of 31 patients without CW at least 12-month follow-up were analyzed. There were ten patients with initially elevated RDW (E) and 21 with normal (N). In whole group after 3 and 12 months of treatment, no change of RDW level was found despite of statistically significant improvement in WHO-FC and tend to decrease of NTproBNP level (NS) (Table 3).

Comparison of data at diagnosis and after 3 and 12-month follow-up

Bold values — statistically significant differences

In both initial RDW-dependent groups (N and E) expected treatment response was observed. Number of patients with high-risk WHO-FC (III/IV) diminished after 1-year follow-up from 4 to 2 in group E (40–20%) and from 10 to 2 in group N (47–9%). NTproBNP changed in group E from 2596 ± 3233 pg/ml to 392 ± 282 pg/ml and in group N from 1212 ± 1645 pg/ml to 704 ± 1030 pg/ml. Because of too small groups statistical analysis was not performed.

### Relationship between red cell distribution width / albumin ratio and carotid plaque in different glucose metabolic States in patients with coronary heart disease: a RCSCD-TCM study in China [^03e88da6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that RAR was significantly related to carotid plaque formation in CHD patients and was strongest in diabetic glycemic state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the predictive value of RAR, a novel combined biomarker, with carotid plaque in patients with CHD.

RDW reflects the size distribution of red blood cells. Traditionally, it is used together with other hematological indicators for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Research shows that RDW can be considered as an indicator of chronic inflammation. In recent years, it has been gradually found that RDW is associated with CVD mortality, RDW can also be used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. High RDW correlates with an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis. In a cross-sectional study of middle-aged and elderly hypertensive patients, the results showed that with the increase of RDW, the proportion of carotid atherosclerosis patients increased. In a cohort study, it was found that RDW was associated with plaque in carotid atherosclerosis, and the association between RDW and the development of CVD could be explained by atherosclerosis. The erythrocyte membrane contains a large amount of free cholesterol, the accumulation of erythrocytes within the atherosclerotic plaque may promote plaque growth and instability. Unstable plaques rich in cholesterol are easy to rupture, so prone to cause acute atherosclerosis events.

ALB is an essential protein in human plasma, widely used to evaluate the nutritional status and reflect the systemic information. Hypoalbuminemia results from and reflects the inflammatory state. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, which participates in the process of CVD. ALB plays an anti-inflammatory role in this process, and once ALB decreases, the disease process will deteriorate. Several studies have reported an association between low ALB and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In addition, the prognostic value of low ALB in acute coronary syndrome and stable CHD has also been reported. The synthesis rate of ALB is affected by nutrient intake and systemic inflammation. Moreover, the decrease of ALB level is related to the increase of blood viscosity, impairment of endothelial function, and the increase of synthesis of an important mediator of platelet-derived carotid stenosis. These may be a potential mechanism to link serum ALB with the severity of carotid artery disease.
