## Question

What is the recommended to stop GLP1 agonist for weight loss

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to discontinue GLP-1 receptor agonists used for weight loss, including when to stop, whether to taper, and how to maintain weight loss after stopping to minimize rebound weight gain and cardiometabolic backsliding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chronic disease framing of obesity and what happens physiologically after GLP-1 RA withdrawal. Then, I should verify valid clinical indications for discontinuation and early stopping rules. Next, I will examine whether abrupt cessation is acceptable or if a transition is preferred based on the reason for stopping. After that, I need to lay out practical transition strategies, including lower-cost alternatives, interval extension, and switching within the class, while checking evidence strength. Finally, I should consider lifestyle countermeasures, monitoring cadence, and documentation and follow-up to catch early relapse and adjust the plan promptly.

> Let me first confirm the chronic disease model and the consequences of stopping effective therapy. Obesity behaves like a relapsing metabolic condition, and stopping GLP-1 RAs typically triggers weight regain and reversion of risk markers toward baseline; in the STEP 1 extension, about two-thirds of prior weight loss returned within a year off semaglutide, with cardiometabolic benefits fading in parallel, which argues for ongoing therapy when effective and tolerated [^112TCecx] [^115PUFTW]. Hold on, I should verify longer-term efficacy expectations while on treatment too; sustained benefits with semaglutide to 68 weeks and beyond are well described in meta-analyses of non-diabetic populations, reinforcing the rationale for continuation when appropriate [^111hWRbR] [^1113efYD].

> Next, I should review valid indications to discontinue. I need to check early stopping rules for primary nonresponse; for liraglutide 3.0 mg, failure to achieve at least 4% weight loss by week 16 predicts poor longer-term response and supports stopping, and analogous heuristics are commonly applied across agents, though formal thresholds vary by drug and jurisdiction [^117AjMRc]. I will now examine adverse effect–driven discontinuation; persistent moderate-to-severe gastrointestinal events and rare serious events often necessitate stopping in real-world cohorts, which is consistent with broader clinical experience and safety surveillance for GLP-1 RAs [^112WReZL] [^112GVAVv]. But wait, what if the barrier is non-medical, like affordability or coverage termination; costs and payer policies are major real-world drivers of discontinuation, so I need to ensure the plan addresses cost-related cessation explicitly and proactively [^112tvkGM] [^111ezbb1].

> Now, the mechanics of stopping: at first glance I might say we should taper all GLP-1 RAs to avoid rebound, but wait, let me verify pharmacologic necessity. Weekly agents have long half-lives that create a de facto pharmacokinetic taper, and there is no evidence that a formal dose taper is required for safety when discontinuing due to intolerance or inefficacy, although clinical monitoring for rebound hyperphagia and weight regain is prudent [^112TCecx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if the drug is working and the stop is cost-driven rather than medically necessary, abrupt cessation predictably leads to regain, so a planned transition strategy is preferred whenever feasible to preserve outcomes [^115PUFTW] [^112TCecx].

> I will now examine transition options when stopping is financially driven but efficacy was good. Let me consider generic anti-obesity medications as bridges; prospective real-world programs suggest that transitioning to combinations such as metformin, topiramate, bupropion, and sometimes phentermine can maintain a substantial fraction of GLP-1 RA–induced weight loss over 12–24 months, though these are lower-credibility data and often require combination therapy and close follow-up [^111vy3PZ] [^1149nxXb]. I should double-check the implication; while not randomized, these cohorts address a common scenario of coverage termination and support a pragmatic, cost-conscious bridge rather than cessation without pharmacologic support [^111vy3PZ].

> Let me think about dosing-interval extension as a maintenance strategy when cost or shortages threaten adherence. Mathematical modeling predicts that moving from weekly to every-2-week dosing retains roughly 70–75% of weight-loss efficacy for semaglutide and tirzepatide, and small case series during shortage conditions reported maintained large weight reductions with extended intervals, but hold on, I should verify the evidence quality; these are modeling studies and very small clinical series, so they warrant cautious, individualized use with outcome monitoring [^117V1ZpH] [^111ptEkp] [^1144mHQo] [^111id3oq]. I need to ensure patients are counseled that this is off-label and evidence-limited, with a plan to revert if weight regain accelerates [^111id3oq].

> I should also review in-class switching and lower-cost agent options. Switching from other GLP-1 RAs to semaglutide can yield incremental weight and HbA1c benefits and, in some analyses, improved short-term health care utilization versus discontinuation, while semaglutide has demonstrated better cost per percent weight loss than liraglutide for obesity, which can inform value-based choices when formularies allow [^116q1cwF] [^117AMpC3] [^111doaEb] [^111aCzzj]. Wait, let me verify broader class expectations; real-world comparative effectiveness shows greater average weight loss with semaglutide and tirzepatide than with earlier agents, but patient selection, dose achievement, and adherence drive variability, so I should confirm these factors before concluding that a prior GLP-1 RA truly "failed" [^115CF5qv] [^111ZKFqL].

> Regardless of the exit path, I need to pair discontinuation with intensified lifestyle support and monitoring. GLP-1 RA–associated weight loss often includes 25–40% lean mass contribution, so emphasizing dietary protein (for example, ≥ 1.2 g/kg adjusted to renal status) and progressive resistance training can mitigate sarcopenic risk during and after transition, and I should confirm readiness and resources for this shift [^115yq654]. I should review a monitoring cadence to catch early relapse; frequent weights and appetite assessment in the first month, then monthly through six months, with prompt action if early regain emerges, are reasonable given the rapid rebound documented after withdrawal in STEP and related analyses [^112TCecx] [^115PUFTW]. Let me verify alignment with guidelines; ADA guidance reinforces ongoing, longitudinal management for obesity and cardiometabolic risk, supporting structured follow-up during medication changes [^1113efYD].

> I will now formalize safety and documentation steps. I need to ensure the chart captures the specific indication for stopping, including financial barriers when present, to support appeals and future re-initiation, and I should schedule an early post-discontinuation visit, ideally within four weeks of the last dose, to reassess appetite, weight trajectory, and metabolic parameters, escalating therapy if needed in line with chronic-care principles [^1113efYD] [^112tvkGM]. But wait, what if rebound is brisk; a pragmatic trigger such as more than 3–5% regain within three months can prompt re-initiation of a GLP-1 RA when feasible or intensification of alternative pharmacotherapy, acknowledging the observed magnitude and timing of regain after withdrawal in trials [^112TCecx] [^115PUFTW].

> Summarizing my recommendation, I should confirm a valid reason before stopping GLP-1 RAs, recognizing obesity's chronicity and the high likelihood of regain after withdrawal; if the drug is effective and tolerated but unaffordable, I should avoid abrupt cessation and instead transition to lower-cost pharmacologic strategies, consider interval extension with caution, and reinforce lifestyle and close monitoring to preserve outcomes; if stopping for nonresponse or intolerance, abrupt cessation is acceptable without a formal taper, but I should still monitor closely for rebound and adjust therapy promptly in a chronic-care framework [^112TCecx] [^115PUFTW] [^notfound] [^111vy3PZ] [^1113efYD].

GLP-1 agonists should **generally not be stopped** after weight-loss goals are achieved, as discontinuation leads to significant weight regain [^112TCecx] and reversal of cardiometabolic benefits [^115PUFTW]. They are intended for **long-term use to maintain weight loss and metabolic improvements** [^115PUFTW] [^1113efYD]; if therapy must be stopped, taper the dose and implement intensive lifestyle and alternative pharmacologic strategies to minimize weight regain [^111vy3PZ].

---

## Clinical evidence on discontinuation and weight regain

- **STEP 1 trial extension**: After 68 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly, participants regained ~68% of lost weight [^112TCecx] within one year of stopping, with cardiometabolic benefits reverting toward baseline.

- **STEP 4 trial**: After a 20-week semaglutide run-in (mean weight loss 10.6%) [^115PUFTW], those who stopped regained 6.9% of baseline weight over 48 weeks, while those who continued lost an additional 7.9% [^114qLrEB].

- **SURMOUNT-4 trial**: Discontinuing tirzepatide after 36 weeks led to ~14% weight regain over 52 weeks, whereas continued therapy maintained weight loss [^114qLrEB].

Collectively, these data show that **stopping GLP-1 agonists leads to substantial weight regain** and reversal of metabolic benefits [^112i1j4A].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidance emphasizes the **chronic nature of obesity** [^115PUFTW] and the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy to maintain weight loss and metabolic health [^1113efYD]. There are no formal stopping rules for GLP-1 agonists after weight-loss goals are met; instead, **continued therapy is recommended** to sustain benefits.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing discontinuation

Decisions about stopping GLP-1 agonists **should be individualized**, considering:

- **Weight loss maintenance**: Ability to maintain weight with lifestyle alone [^112i1j4A].

- **Metabolic health**: Presence of comorbidities (e.g. T2D, hypertension, dyslipidemia) [^1113efYD].

- **Adverse effects**: Tolerability and side effects [^112GVAVv].

- **Patient preference**: Willingness for long-term therapy [^111ezbb1].

- **Cost and access**: Financial and insurance considerations [^112tvkGM].

## Risks and benefits of continued therapy versus discontinuation

| **Continued therapy** | **Discontinuation** |
|-|-|
| Sustained weight loss [^111hWRbR] | Significant weight regain [^112TCecx] |
| Maintained metabolic improvements [^1125HQ2F] | Reversal of metabolic benefits [^112TCecx] |
| Improved quality of life | Increased risk of obesity-related complications [^1125HQ2F] |
| Potential long-term safety concerns [^112GVAVv] | Reduced medication-related adverse effects |
| Financial burden [^112tvkGM] | Cost savings |

---

## Recommended strategies for discontinuation

If discontinuation is necessary, **use a structured approach**:

- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce dose gradually to minimize rebound appetite and weight regain.

- **Intensive lifestyle interventions**: Implement dietary, physical activity, and behavioral strategies [^1125HQ2F].

- **Alternative pharmacotherapy**: Consider cost-effective options (e.g. metformin, topiramate, bupropion) to help maintain weight loss [^111vy3PZ] [^1149nxXb].

- **Regular monitoring**: Track weight, metabolic parameters, and quality of life, with prompt intervention if weight regain occurs [^1113efYD].

---

## Conclusion and practical recommendations

GLP-1 agonists are intended for **long-term use to maintain weight loss** [^111hWRbR] and metabolic health; **discontinuation leads to substantial weight regain** [^112TCecx] and reversal of benefits. If therapy must be stopped, **taper the dose** and use intensive lifestyle and alternative pharmacologic strategies [^111vy3PZ] to minimize weight regain.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: a real-world study [^111vy3PZ]. Obesity (2024). Low credibility.

This prospective real-world study demonstrates that patients treated with GLP-1 RA therapy for 12 months, who achieved a BMI of less than 30 kg/m² and then transitioned to cost-effective alternative AOMs, were able to lose an average of 25.1% ± 2.6% of their body weight and maintain the weight reduction for up to 24 months. Furthermore, fat percentage, based on a bioelectrical impedance analysis, decreased by 10% after 12 months.

Among this cohort, those who transitioned to generic AOMs (such as metformin, topiramate, phentermine, and bupropion) after the MWLB pharmacy coverage ended at 12 months were able to maintain their weight loss up to 24 months. This demonstrates that alternative and inexpensive medications can be used for weight maintenance if GLP-1 RA therapy cannot be continued. These generic medications can offset the weight regain expected with GLP-1 RA discontinuation.

These results are noteworthy as many patients lose insurance coverage for GLP-1 RAs and are concerned about weight regain off the medications. Since these older-generation AOMs also target appetite, insulin resistance, cravings, and satiety, they are suitable and cost-effective alternatives for the treatment of obesity and overweight at the appropriate doses.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: The STEP 1 trial extension [^112TCecx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1,961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (or ≥ 27 kg/m² with ≥ 1 weight-related co-morbidity) without diabetes to 68 weeks of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16 weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off-treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany, and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.

Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, the mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.

One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their lost weight. Cardiometabolic improvements were not sustained, highlighting the potential need for ongoing treatment to maintain benefits.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: A narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^115PUFTW]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Another important concern regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) is the potential for weight regain upon discontinuation of treatment. In an extension of the STEP-1 trial, participants originally randomized to semaglutide regained 68% of their lost weight after one year of discontinuing treatment. Cardiometabolic improvements achieved with semaglutide also reverted towards baseline for most risk factors after one year.

The STEP-4 trial included a 20-week run-in period during which participants achieved a mean weight loss of 10.6% after treatment with weekly semaglutide. From week 20 to week 68, participants who discontinued the drug regained an average of 6.9% of their baseline body weight, while those who continued treatment lost an additional 7.9%. These findings suggest that ongoing treatment with GLP-1 RAs is required to maintain improvements in weight and health, highlighting the chronicity of obesity. Recognizing obesity as a chronic disorder underscores the need for long-term pharmacological treatment, similar to the approach used for managing type 2 diabetes or hypertension to achieve optimal control.

### Less frequent dosing of GLP-1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy [^1144mHQo]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first case series to describe the clinical outcomes of patients taking incretin mimetics with extended intervals between doses to maintain weight loss. This strategy emerged out of desperation amid drug shortages, yet these patients maintained a large proportion of their weight loss with fewer overall doses.

Our first patient deliberately self-administered tirzepatide 7.5 mg every 10 to 14 days and experienced an additional 13.7% reduction in body weight over 7 months, with maintenance thereafter. Incretin mimetic therapy enabled our second patient to lose 30% of body weight and safely discontinue insulin; even when limited supplies of tirzepatide forced her to dose intermittently, she retained an overall 22.8% reduction in body weight from baseline.

Naturally, a larger case series is needed to determine how the success of these two individuals extends to other patients.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^117AjMRc]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

It is well documented that early response to a weight loss intervention can predict long-term weight loss; this is the basis for the stopping rules for all recently approved weight loss medications. Weight loss response after 1 to 4 months has been used to predict weight loss at 1 year. Interestingly, in the Look AHEAD study, 1- and 2-month weight loss was associated with weight loss through year 8 among individuals with T2D who received an intensive lifestyle intervention.

To identify an optimal early response criterion for liraglutide 3.0 mg, we examined weight loss of ≥ 3%, 4%, or 5% at 8, 12, or 16 weeks in a pooled analysis predefined with the US FDA before trial data became available. Weight loss of ≥ 4% at week 16 was shown to be the best predictor of ≥ 5% weight loss at 56 weeks and to be appropriate for individuals with and without T2D and for both genders (Table 1, Supporting Information Table S1). Earlier time points would result in discontinuation of treatment for a significant number of individuals who would indeed achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks, while later time points would likely have achieved even greater predictive accuracy but were not considered as they would have entailed additional unnecessary exposure in nonresponders. Accordingly, the stopping rule in the United States specifies a weight loss of ≥ 4% at 16 weeks. While health authorities across the world focus on limiting treatment to those who will benefit, their approaches differ slightly. The European Medicines Agency required an early response criterio.

### Review of head-to-head comparisons of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^112g72vW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The weight benefit varies among GLP-1RAs and studies. For example, Ji et al. found that exenatide twice daily was associated with a significantly greater reduction in weight than exenatide once weekly (p < 0.001) but, in DURATION-1 and DURATION-5, weight loss was not significantly different between the two exenatide formulations. In the T-emerge 2 study, exenatide twice daily showed a greater (non-significant) reduction in weight than taspoglutide 10 mg once weekly but showed no difference in weight loss compared with taspoglutide 20 mg once weekly.

In the LEAD-6 study, exenatide twice daily and liraglutide treatment led to similar levels of weight loss (3.2 and 2.9 kg, respectively; p = 0.2235). Exenatide twice daily was associated with greater (non-significant) weight loss than lixisenatide in the GetGoal-X study, and liraglutide treatment led to greater weight loss than lixisenatide in the study by Kapitza et al. (p < 0.01; Figure 3). Other head-to-head trials revealed significantly greater reductions in weight with liraglutide than the once-weekly treatments exenatide (p = 0.0005), albiglutide (p < 0.0001), and dulaglutide (p = 0.011; Figure 4). Between-treatment differences were 0.9, 1.6, and 0.7 kg, respectively.

### Achievement of HbA1c and weight targets in adults with type 2 diabetes on once weekly injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy in UK primary care: A retrospective, real-world study [^113SgF6h]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

**Results**: The achievement of ≥ 1% HbA1c reduction and no weight loss or weight loss of > 0%, ≥ 5%, or ≥ 10% was highest for those within the second quintile, with percentages of 52.6%, 33.2%, and 14.1%, respectively. Attainment of both ≥ 1% HbA1c reduction and ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, or ≥ 15% weight reduction after 6 months was highest among patients with a T2D duration of 0%, ≥ 5%, or ≥ 10%. This was most notable in patients receiving one concomitant anti-diabetic treatment.

### Impact on HbA1c and body weight of switching from other GLP-1 receptor agonists to semaglutide: A model-based approach [^116q1cwF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The impact of switching treatment from another GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to semaglutide was investigated by analyses of exposure-response models.

- **Methods**: HbA1c and body weight time-course models were developed using up to 30 weeks of observations from four trials in the semaglutide phase 3 programme. Given the recommended dosing for each GLP-1RA, pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated based on published population pharmacokinetic models. Exposure was adjusted by the relative potencies to ensure that model predictions matched the effects observed in clinical trials. After 26 weeks of simulated treatment with liraglutide, dulaglutide, or exenatide extended-release, simulated semaglutide treatment was initiated 1 day after the last once-daily dose of liraglutide and 1 week after the last once-weekly doses of dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release.

- **Results**: The potency-adjusted total effective GLP-1RA concentration increased after switching from another GLP-1RA to semaglutide and was associated with reductions ranging from ~0.3% to ~0.8% points for HbA1c and from ~2% to ~4% for body weight with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Temporary slight deteriorations in HbA1c were observed after switching to semaglutide 0.25 mg from liraglutide 1.2/1.8 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg.

- **Conclusions**: Exposure-response modelling suggests that switching to semaglutide from liraglutide, dulaglutide, or exenatide extended-release results in further reductions in HbA1c and body weight.

### Obesity treatment with bariatric surgery vs GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112C18hC]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition with negative consequences for patients, the health care system, and society. The most effective treatment for class II and III obesity is metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS), often considered a last resort. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have recently shown promising results. This study aimed to compare weight loss and ongoing costs associated with MBS and GLP-1 RAs in the US.

This cohort study utilized data from the Highmark Health insurance claims database and the Allegheny Health Network electronic medical records in the US. Participants were patients with class II or III obesity treated with either MBS or GLP-1 RAs. They were enrolled in Highmark insurance for at least six months before the index treatment and had follow-up data available for at least 12 months. Using propensity score weighting, the populations were adjusted for differences in baseline spending, health care utilization, age, sex, comorbidities, and smoking status. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to July 2025.

- **Exposures**: MBS (sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) vs. GLP-1 RAs (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcomes were total weight loss and monthly ongoing costs (pharmacy, medical, and surgery costs) at baseline and over two years after index treatment. Mean adjusted costs were calculated using a linear mixed-effects model.

Analyses included 30,458 patients (mean [SD] age, 50 [11] years; 20,118 [66.1%] female).

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^114vYeLM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide and drives significant morbidity and mortality. It increases the risk of a variety of other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In the United States (US), approximately 71% of adults are overweight, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) in kg/m² greater than or equal to 25, including 41% who are obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 8% who are severely obese (BMI ≥ 40). The financial costs of excess adiposity are massive, with an estimated over $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US every year.

We are currently in the midst of a revolution in weight loss interventions. Indeed, while both lifestyle and older pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated limited efficacy, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) receptor agonists have recently been shown to yield unprecedented levels of weight loss. For example, the incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown via meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to induce placebo-adjusted average body weight losses of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, and have shown significant weight loss in a recent head-to-head comparison.

### Glp-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: A living benefit-harm modelling study [^114qLrEB]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The trade-off between the benefits and harms of GLP-1 RA treatment is challenging due to the multitude of parameters and outcomes to consider concurrently. It is even more challenging when considering GLP-1 RAs for weight maintenance. Evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for rapid weight loss in conjunction with lifestyle interventions during the first years of treatment. However, all RCTs showed that weight reduction stabilizes over time after the initial 1 or 2 years of treatment.

This triggers an important question: whether discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy (but having a high risk of weight rebounding) or continuing it for weight maintenance (with no further weight loss but higher harm risks) is beneficial for the overall health of individuals. This requires a separate analysis. For instance, the STEP 1 and STEP 4 trials demonstrated that patients who stopped taking semaglutide experienced significant weight regain and a reversal of cardiometabolic benefits, whereas those who continued the treatment maintained their weight loss. Similarly, the S-LITE and SURMOUNT-4 trials also reported weight regain following the discontinuation of liraglutide and tirzepatide, respectively. This was supported by an observational study, albeit in people living with diabetes, that reported an increased risk of CVD events in those who withdrew GLP-1 RAs.

The long-term harms and benefits are also not clear. Although the RCTs available so far are too short to observe long-term benefit or harm outcomes, they have signaled some important harms.

### Real-world GLP-1 RA therapy in type 2 diabetes: A long-term effectiveness observational study [^112WReZL]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Proportion of patients**: ■, with gastrointestinal adverse events a; □, withdrawn from GLP-1 RA treatment b; and, lacking efficacy for HbA1c or BMI reduction c. BMI refers to body mass index, and HbA1c stands for glycated haemoglobin. Solid Bar: Gastrointestinal adverse events; Empty Bar: Patients withdrawn from GLP-1 RA therapy; Grid Bar: Lack of efficacy for HbA1c or BMI.
	- a. Gastrointestinal adverse events included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea.
	- b. GLP-1 RA treatment withdrawal was based on either the patient's or physician's decision.
	- c. Lack of efficacy for HbA1c or BMI reduction was defined by achieving at least a 0.5% HbA1c and/or at least a 3% BMI reduction versus baseline after at least 6 months of follow-up.

Finally, Table 3 reflects changes in background therapy after the introduction of GLP-1 RA treatment. Early in the follow-up, a significant reduction in the number of antidiabetic drugs was observed (2.18 ± 0.99 vs. 1.80 ± 0.78 at 6 months; P < 0.001, ANCOVA test for repeated measures), and as expected, this reduction was mostly driven by a nearly total fall in the use of DPP-IV inhibitors. Conversely, a progressive increase in concomitant use with SGLT-2 inhibitors was seen, while SU use remained fairly constant. Notably, in 25.28% of patients on basal insulin and in 66.0% on bolus insulin at baseline, insulin therapy was completely withdrawn in subsequent follow-up visits.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^117V1ZpH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Alternative dosing of tirzepatide**: Figure 3 predicts the efficacy of tirzepatide under alternative dosing regimens, which involve decreasing dose frequency and potentially increasing dose size. In Figure 3A, the steady-state percent change in body weight is plotted as a function of the time between doses for 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide. Analogous to Figure 2A, decreasing the dose frequency does not commensurately decrease weight loss efficacy. For example, for the standard q1wk dosing, the model predicts steady-state body weight reductions of 17%, 21%, and 23% for tirzepatide at 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively, which is in good agreement with clinical data. For q2wk dosing, the model predicts steady-state body weight reductions of 12%, 16%, and 18% for tirzepatide at 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively. Hence, similar to semaglutide, the model predicts that patients retain roughly 75% of their weight loss when merely switching from q1wk to q2wk dosing.

- **Figure 3**: Alternative dosing regimens of tirzepatide decrease costs and maintain efficacy.
	- **Steady-state percent change in body weight (A)**: This is shown as a function of the dosing interval, i.e. the time between doses. The markers highlight weight loss for once-weekly dosing (q1wk) versus once every other week dosing (q2wk).
	- **Cost reduction and efficacy maintenance (B)**: A patient currently on 5 mg q1wk can decrease costs and maintain (or improve) efficacy. The markers indicate that switching to q2wk decreases costs by 50% and maintains (i) 70% of their weight loss if the dose size is kept at 5 mg, (ii) 95% of their weight loss if the dose size is doubled to 10 mg, and (iii) 111% of their weight loss.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1113efYD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the inclusion of a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for glycemic management. These can serve as an adjunct to healthy interventions for weight loss in adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Metabolic Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), and overweight or obesity. Specifically, they highlight the potential benefits of these agents in managing glycemic levels and supporting weight loss efforts.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111CwBAi]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to initial therapy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend including an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with demonstrated benefits for glycemic management, irrespective of HbA1c levels, and for slowing the progression of CKD and reducing cardiovascular events in adult patients with T2DM and CKD. These recommendations apply to individuals with confirmed eGFR of 20–60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or albuminuria. It is recognized that the glycemic benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors are reduced at eGFR levels below 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^112GVAVv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

As our review shows, our knowledge of adverse events for the GLP‐1RAs is largely based on the study of these drugs in the management of diabetes. There are several reasons why data on adverse events might not translate between these populations. For one, the users of GLP‐1RAs for weight management are roughly 20–25 years younger on average than those using the same drugs for the management of diabetes. Even under the strong assumption that the relative risk increases translate between these populations, the much lower baseline risk of most diseases among younger individuals will make the absolute magnitude of such risks markedly different. Second, some adverse effects might be directly or indirectly linked to the indication of diabetes and hyperglycemia. This is obvious for diabetic retinopathy and also hypothesized for the use of GLP‐1RA and the risk of NAION, making it uncertain whether the same effect can be expected with the use of the drugs for weight management. As such, there is a need to study the occurrence of adverse effects specifically among users of GLP‐1RA for weight management and, in particular, the absolute risk of these effects.

- **Methodological quality**: With the growing body of literature on the real‐world use and effects of GLP‐1RA, there is an increasing need to not only summarize this literature but also to evaluate and strengthen its methodological quality.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists induce loss of lean mass: So does caloric restriction [^115yq654]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

Caloric restriction (CR) studies show a trade-off in weight loss composition. While around 60% of weight loss comes from fat mass, approximately 30% comes from lean mass. This proportion fluctuates based on factors such as sex, age, the severity of calorie restriction (where more severe CR leads to greater muscle loss), and dietary composition. Even in very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD), which are characterized by higher lean mass loss due to the severity of CR, the former can be mitigated when this dietary approach is combined with resistance training and strategic protein intake. Pharmacologically induced weight loss with GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA) shows a lean mass loss of about 25%–40%, which could be particularly concerning in specific populations, such as the elderly or patients with sarcopenic obesity. However, the same holds true for CR approaches in these musculoskeletal fragile populations. Nevertheless, clinical studies indicate that GLP-1 RA-induced weight loss leads to an increased proportion of lean mass relative to total body weight, thus being overall positive from a body composition perspective.

Studies on metabolic surgery and CR show that, despite the muscle mass loss observed, weight reduction generally improves muscle functionality (e.g. insulin sensitivity) and physical mobility. Beyond the scientific study setting, where investigators tend to isolate different approaches (e.g. CR, metabolic surgery, or GLP-1 RA) to better understand their direct effect on clinical outcomes, it is crucial to stress that clinical guidelines for the treatment of obesity and its related complications (e.g. National Institutes of Health guidelines) should be considered in practice.

### Exenatide once weekly treatment maintained improvements in glycemic control and weight loss over 2 years [^114ZhA3C]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

The once-weekly (QW) formulation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide has been demonstrated to improve A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, serum lipid profiles, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes through 52 weeks of treatment. In this report, we describe the 2-year results of the open-label, open-ended extension to the DURATION-1 trial of exenatide QW for type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: A two-stage protocol was used: patients received either exenatide QW (2 mg) or exenatide twice daily for 30 weeks (5 μg for the first 4 weeks and 10 μg thereafter), followed by 1.5 years of treatment with exenatide QW (2 mg), for a total of 2 years (104 weeks) of exenatide treatment. Of the 295 (intent-to-treat [ITT]) patients who entered the trial, 73% (n = 216) completed 2 years of treatment (completer population). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SE) for these patients were: A1C, 8.2 ± 0.1%; FPG, 168.4 ± 43.0 mg/dL; body weight, 101.1 ± 18.7 kg; and diabetes duration, 7 ± 5 years.

- **Results**: In the completer population, significant improvements (LS mean ± SE [95% CI]) were maintained after 2 years of treatment in A1C (-1.71 ± 0.08% [-1.86 to -1.55%]), FPG (-40.1 ± 2.9 mg/dL [-45.7 to -34.5 mg/dL]), and body weight (-2.61 ± 0.52 kg [-3.64 to -1.58 kg]) compared with baseline. The percentages of patients who achieved an A1C of < 7.0% and ≤ 6.5% at 2 years were 60% and 39%, respectively. A significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP; -3.0 ± 1.0 mmHg [-4.9 to -1.1 mmHg]) was maintained through 2 years of treatment.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists combined with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce weight in type 1 diabetes [^115sJN1Z]. Obesity (2023). High credibility.

This study evaluated whether adding sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) to insulin reduced weight and glycemia in people with type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This retrospective analysis of electronic health records evaluated 296 people with type 1 diabetes over 12 months after medications were first prescribed. Four groups were defined: control (n = 80), SGLT2i (n = 94), GLP1-RA (n = 82), and combination of drugs (Combo) (n = 40). We measured changes at 1 year in weight and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

- **Results**: The control group did not have changes in weight or glycemic control. The mean (SD) percentage weight loss after 12 months was 4.4% (6.0%), 8.2% (8.5%), and 9.0% (8.4%) in the SGLT2i, GLP1-RA, and Combo groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The Combo group lost the most weight (p < 0.001). The HbA1c reduction was 0.4% (0.7%), 0.3% (0.7%), and 0.6% (0.8%) in the SGLT2i, GLP1-RA, and Combo groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The Combo group had the biggest improvements in glycemic control and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with baseline (all p < 0.01). Severe adverse events were similar between all the groups, with no increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Conclusions**: The SGLT2i and GLP1-RA agents on their own improved body weight and glycemia, but combining the medications resulted in more weight loss. Treatment intensification appears to result in benefits with no difference in severe adverse events.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116fzQM4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning initial therapy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend including a GLP-1 receptor agonist with demonstrated benefits for both glycemic management and the reduction of heart failure-related symptoms in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity, irrespective of HbA1c.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^111ptEkp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

To discover alternative dosing regimens of incretin mimetics that simultaneously reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy, we used mathematical modeling and simulation of semaglutide and tirzepatide to investigate dosing regimens that have not yet been studied clinically. For semaglutide, we employed a recent pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model. For tirzepatide, we utilized a recent PK model and reparameterized the semaglutide PD model to fit tirzepatide clinical data.

Reducing dose frequency does not commensurately reduce weight loss results. For example, switching from one dose per week (q1wk) to one dose every two weeks (q2wk) maintains roughly 75% of the weight loss. Furthermore, if the decrease in dose frequency involves an appropriate increase in dose size, then approximately 100% of the weight loss is maintained. In addition, we compared offering incretin mimetics to (1) a fraction of obese US adults with q1wk dosing versus (2) twice as many obese US adults with q2wk dosing. Though scenarios (1) and (2) require the same budget, analysis suggests that scenario (2) reduces national obesity and mortality to a much greater degree.

Our study highlights the potential utility of alternative dosing regimens of incretin mimetics. Compared with standard once-weekly dosing, costs can be halved while maintaining weight loss.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remain unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks.

The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of four randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the three trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m². Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: A joint advisory from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and The Obesity Society [^112tvkGM]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

In manufacturer-sponsored trials of GLP-1s for obesity, reported adherence, or sustained use, has ranged from 83% to 88% at 66–68 weeks. However, adherence is much lower in practice, with about 33%-50% at one year and 15% at two years. Discontinuation is associated with older age (≥ 65 years), poor weight response, and moderate or severe gastrointestinal side effects. The relative influences of other factors on discontinuation are unclear, including changes in insurance coverage, high out-of-pocket costs, medication shortages, or "false cessation" due to switching to compounded (pharmacy-prepared) GLP-1s. Low adherence may also relate to lower public and clinician awareness of the need for long-term use following a weight goal, health goal, or plateau is reached.

The US list price for GLP-1s for obesity ranges from approximately $12,000 to $16,000 per year. Full costs may be incurred by those who self-pay, due to either off-label use or lack of payer coverage. With manufacturer coupons and discounts, costs can be lowered to approximately $7,000 to $8,000 per year. Coverage and costs for Medicaid programs vary by state, as each state determines coverage decisions and negotiates prices with drug manufacturers. Some states have dropped coverage for GLP-1s due to high costs and unsuccessful pricing negotiations. Medicare does not currently cover GLP-1s for obesity but recently announced that they will be among the drug classes which the federal government will aim to negotiate in 2025; average price reductions in prior negotiations for other drug classes have ranged from 38% to 79% from the original list price.

### Liraglutide versus semaglutide for weight reduction-a cost needed to treat analysis [^111aCzzj]. Obesity (2023). High credibility.

Higher doses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists liraglutide and, more recently, semaglutide have demonstrated a significant reduction in body weight. However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear. The cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using semaglutide or liraglutide was calculated. The body weight reductions were extracted from the published STEP 1 trial and the SCALE trial results, respectively. A scenario analysis was performed to mitigate the primary differences between the two studies' populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022.

Liraglutide in STEP 1 resulted in a weight loss of 5.4% (95% CI: 5%-5.8%). Semaglutide in SCALE resulted in a weight loss of 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%). The total cost of therapy with liraglutide during the trial was estimated at $17,585 compared with $22,878 with semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with liraglutide is estimated at $3256 (95% CI: $3032-$3517) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide.

Semaglutide provides significantly better value for money than liraglutide for weight reduction.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment increases bone formation and prevents bone loss in weight-reduced obese women [^113NRz2b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) regulates bone turnover, but the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on bone in obese, weight-reduced individuals are unknown. This study investigates the role of GLP-1 RAs on bone formation and weight loss-induced bone mass reduction.

- **Design**: Randomized control study.
- **Setting**: Outpatient research hospital clinic.
- **Participants**: Thirty-seven healthy obese women with a body mass index of 34 ± 0.5 kg/m² and age 46 ± 2 years.
- **Intervention**: After a low-calorie-diet-induced 12% weight loss, participants were randomized to treatment with or without administration of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) for 52 weeks. In case of weight gain, up to two meals per day could be replaced with a low-calorie-diet product to maintain the weight loss.
- **Main Outcome Measures**: Total, pelvic, and arm-leg bone mineral content (BMC) and bone markers [C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1) and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP)] were investigated before and after weight loss, and after 52-week weight maintenance. Primary endpoints were changes in BMC and bone markers after 52-week weight maintenance with or without GLP-1 RA treatment.

Results showed that total, pelvic, and arm-leg BMC decreased during weight maintenance in the control group (P < .0001), but not significantly in the liraglutide group. Thus, total and arm-leg BMC loss was four times greater in the control group compared to the liraglutide group (estimated difference, 27 g; 95% confidence interval, 5–48; p = 0.01).

### Outcomes in GLP-1 RA-experienced patients switching to once-weekly semaglutide in a real-world setting: The retrospective, observational EXPERT study [^117AMpC3]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are highly effective for glycemic control and weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this retrospective, observational study, we analyzed glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight following switching to semaglutide from any other GLP-1 RA, using US electronic health records and prescription data.

- **Methods**: Adults (≥ 18 years old) with T2D were required to have at least one prescription for injectable semaglutide at the index date (treatment switch), at least one prescription for any other GLP-1 RA in the previous 365 days, a baseline HbA1c and/or weight measurement in the 90 days pre-index, and a follow-up measurement at 180 and 365 days post-index. HbA1c and weight cohorts were analyzed separately using an ANCOVA model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in patients with at least two prescriptions for pre-switch GLP-1 RA. A secondary analysis compared subgroups receiving different GLP-1 RAs pre-switch.

- **Results**: Patients with HbA1c (n = 710) and weight (n = 921) data had similar baseline characteristics. Significant reductions in HbA1c at 6 months (0.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8, -0.6) were sustained at 12 months. Weight reductions were significant at 6 months (-2.1 kg; 95% CI -2.6, -1.6) and greater at 12 months (-2.8 kg; 95% CI -3.9, -1.8). These patterns were consistent with the two-prescription sensitivity analysis and independent of the pre-switch GLP-1 RA.

- **Conclusion**: Switching to injectable semaglutide from any other GLP-1 RA was associated with significant improvements in glycemic control and weight.

### The current and future role of insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes: A narrative review [^114U7z6Y]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Long-term adverse consequences of discontinuation, in addition to losing the cardiorenal protection benefits, individuals who discontinue GLP-1 RA medications typically gain back much of the weight they had lost during therapy. In a retrospective cohort study of adults with T2D, investigators assessed changes in cardiovascular risk and other outcomes in 395 individuals with no history of CVD (primary prevention group) and 155 individuals with a known history of CVD (secondary prevention). In the primary prevention arm of the trial (n = 395), 40.25% of patients discontinued therapy following a mean of 3.2 years. At year 4, weight loss was significantly greater among patients who continued therapy than among those who discontinued therapy (−4.14 vs. −1.19 kg, respectively; p < 0.001), and even greater differences were observed in the secondary prevention group (−4.46 vs. −0.75 kg, respectively; p = 0.006). The investigators reported that discontinuation of therapy was independently associated with a significant increase in the risk of developing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE).

More significant differences in weight change were observed in a randomized trial that compared treatment with once-weekly semaglutide with a switch to placebo for weight maintenance in 902 adults with overweight or obesity following a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide. Among the 803 participants who completed the run-in period, mean weight loss over the 48-week follow-up period was significantly greater among those who continued therapy (−7.9%) compared to a 6.9% increase among those who switched to placebo.

### Glp-1 medication and weight loss: Barriers and motivators among 1659 participants managed in a virtual setting [^111ezbb1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, alongside dual receptor agonists targeting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, represent transformative therapies for obesity management. Despite their increasing use, patient perspectives of these treatments remain underexplored. This exploratory study aimed to examine the experiences and attitudes of individuals using GLP-1 medications (GLP-1s) for weight loss, focusing on motivators, barriers, and reasons for discontinuation.

Surveys were conducted to assess both the overall experience of using GLP-1s and the factors influencing discontinuation. A complementary video diary study provided qualitative insights into personal weight loss journeys.

Findings highlighted that 55% of the 1659 participants had attempted weight loss for over 10 years before starting GLP-1s. Perceived barriers to weight loss included eating habits, stress, and menopause. Motivators centered on reducing weight-related health risks and improving body satisfaction. Discontinuation was influenced by treatment costs, unmet weight loss expectations, and side effects. Participants reported that GLP-1 medications effectively reduced food-related thoughts ('food noise'), improved satiety, and supported healthier eating behaviors. However, stigma and affordability challenges were notable deterrents. While some patients adopted lifestyle changes alongside the treatment, others relied predominantly on GLP-1s for results.

These findings underscore the importance of addressing patient-specific needs and concerns to enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of GLP-1 therapies for weight management.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115CF5qv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In general, many real-world studies suggested smaller weight loss (in kg or %) than what has been observed in the RCTs, with results up to 6% with liraglutide, 14% with semaglutide, and 18% with tirzepatide versus placebo. Estimated weight loss was highly variable between studies; however, even within the same GLP-1RA, this was related to differences in user characteristics such as the proportion with T2D and previous use or not of GLP-1RA at baseline. Other influencing factors included differences in drug dosages, the comprehensiveness of the weight management program, follow-up time, and the weight measurement method used (e.g. self-reported or other measurements of body weight).

The percentage weight reduction over typically 6–12 months of follow-up ranged from 2.2% to 18.5% for liraglutide, 4.4% to 19.5% for semaglutide, and 4.8% to 21.2% for tirzepatide. Importantly, the weight-loss effectiveness of GLP-1RA was similar to what has been observed in trials when focusing on the subgroup of adherent patients who consistently took their prescribed GLP-1RA at 12 months follow-up. In contrast, studies reporting results in an 'as-started' approach found considerably lower effectiveness.

Semaglutide and tirzepatide initiators appeared to achieve the greatest weight loss in real life, while weight loss effects were weaker for patients with T2D than for obese people without diabetes, which was also observed in trials. Only two studies of tirzepatide for T2D were identified, and they reported lower weight loss results than in the trials. Both studies included many individuals switching to tirzepatide from other GLP-1RAs.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of suboptimal initial clinical response and weight gain recurrence after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112smhhS]. Obesity Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Suboptimal initial clinical response (SICR) and weight gain recurrence (WGR) are challenging issues following bariatric surgery. Recently, the promising weight loss effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been applied to bariatric patients. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of SICR and WGR after bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed across online databases. The primary outcomes were percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and absolute weight loss. Secondary outcomes included changes in biochemical markers and adverse effects (AEs).

- **Results**: Nineteen studies including 1290 patients were included. After at least 3 months of treatment, the pooled %TWL was 9.24% for liraglutide, 11.38% for semaglutide, and 15.50% for tirzepatide, with corresponding weight reductions of 8.56 kg, 11.62 kg, and 12.60 kg, respectively. Additionally, %TWL and weight loss with liraglutide use were 7.65% and 7.47 kg for ≤ 6 months, 10.22% and 9.30 kg for 6–12 months, and 10.80% and 9.72 kg for ≥ 12 months. For semaglutide, the %TWL and weight reduction were 10.18% and 9.43 kg at 6 months, and 13.15% and 14.68 kg at 12 months. Biochemical markers, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase levels showed significant reductions after GLP-1 RA treatment. Common AEs were nausea (23%), vomiting (6%), diarrhea (6%), constipation (10%), headache (6%), fatigue (8%), and abdominal symptoms.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: A model-based approach [^114ADEK6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

A predefined set of covariates based on prior knowledge of the liraglutide mechanism and previous liraglutide exposure-response analyses were tested using a stepwise covariate search algorithm for all variables identified with individual variability (IIV; forward inclusion: P < 0.01; backwards elimination: P < 0.001). The covariates assessed were:

- **Baseline characteristics**: Baseline body weight, baseline HbA1c, age at baseline
- **Diabetes status**: No diabetes, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes
- **Demographics**: Sex (female/male), race (white, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native)
- **Trial region**: Europe and Oceania, North America, Asia, Africa, South America

A detailed description of the covariate selection strategy is provided in the Supporting Information.

- **Influence of time of the year on weight change**: The influence of time of the year on the rate of weight change was initially graphically explored. First, using a temporary and exploratory model structure (Supporting Information, yearly variation sub-model), deviation factors for each month of the year were estimated, with January as reference. An oscillation pattern would be indicative of an underlying structure, suggesting the influence of time of the year on weight change. Following the identification of the weight oscillation pattern, different seasonal fluctuation sub-models were explored, and the final model was qualified based on the objective function and visual improvement in goodness-of-fit plots.

- **Precision of model parameters**: The precision of model parameters was derived by performing a sampling-importance-resampling procedure. The performance of the final model was evaluated using this approach.

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^1125HQ2F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Obesity remains a major public health problem, affecting almost half of adults in the United States. Increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality are major obesity-related complications, and management guidelines now recommend weight loss as a key strategy for the primary prevention of CVD in patients with overweight or obesity.

The recently demonstrated efficacy of some pharmacologic therapies for chronic weight management may encourage health care professionals to recognize obesity as a treatable serious chronic disease and motivate patients to re-engage with weight loss when previous attempts have been ineffective or unsustainable.

This review article summarizes the benefits and challenges associated with lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery, and historical pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of obesity, and focuses on the evidence for the efficacy and safety of the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist medications in the management of obesity and potential reduction of CVD risk.

We conclude that the available evidence demonstrates glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists should be strongly considered in clinical practice for the treatment of obesity and reduction of CVD risk in people with type 2 diabetes. If ongoing research proves glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to be effective in reducing the risk of CVD onset in patients with obesity, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status, it will herald a new treatment paradigm in this setting. Now is the time for health care professionals to better recognize the potential of these treatments.

### Preoperative glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and bariatric surgery outcomes: A systematic review [^117Rdvkz]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to systematically review existing evidence on the preoperative use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) before metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched systematically using relevant keywords for articles on the effect of preoperative GLP-1 RA use on MBS outcomes. Eleven observational studies evaluated the effects of preoperative GLP-1 RAs.

GLP-1 RAs enhance preoperative weight loss with earlier optimization for MBS. The preoperative use of these agents was associated with increased postoperative nausea but showed no significant differences in the rate of major complications or readmissions. Benefits included improved diabetes outcomes, although findings on postoperative weight loss were inconsistent, and some studies reported higher surgical adhesion rates. More robust evidence is needed to guide the incorporation of GLP-1 RAs into preoperative pathways for MBS.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: A model-based approach [^1143zNFb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Observed mean weight relative to baseline for Trial 1 (A), Trial 2 (B), and Trial 3 (C) versus time since the first dose is shown. The main trial phase for Trials 1 and 2 was up to week 56. Participants who discontinued the trial prematurely were asked to return to trial sites at week 56, and their weight was recorded (in‐trial). After the main phase, participants were discontinued from liraglutide treatment and followed up for 12 weeks. Response data are presented as mean change from baseline body weight as observed, with 95% confidence intervals. Lines represent the mean model population predictions. Data up to week 56 were included in the model development.

The bi-phasic PK/PD model that was used to describe the weight change–time profiles led to a significant improvement in both the log-likelihood (ΔOFV = ‐6710, +3 parameters) and the goodness-of-fit plots compared to a classic indirect response model. Figure 2 shows the early and sustained weight change phases, as well as the net weight loss effects for the placebo group following liraglutide 3.0 mg therapy. Treatment differences could be identified for both the transient and the sustained weight loss phases. Liraglutide increased the sustained weight change from baseline in a concentration‐dependent manner via a saturable concentration–effect relationship. The estimated liraglutide EC50 was 22.5 nmol/L (95% confidence interval 17.5–28.2), which is in good agreement with previous exposure–response analyses.

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^112ZXHFg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Obesity remains a major public health problem, affecting almost half of adults in the United States. Increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality are major obesity-related complications, and management guidelines now recommend weight loss as a key strategy for the primary prevention of CVD in patients with overweight or obesity. The recently demonstrated efficacy of some pharmacologic therapies for chronic weight management may encourage health care professionals to recognize obesity as a treatable serious chronic disease and motivate patients to re-engage with weight loss when previous attempts have been ineffective or unsustainable.

This review article summarizes the benefits and challenges associated with lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery, and historical pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of obesity, and focuses on the evidence for the efficacy and safety of the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist medications in the management of obesity and potential reduction of CVD risk. We conclude that the available evidence demonstrates glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists should be strongly considered in clinical practice for the treatment of obesity and reduction of CVD risk in people with type 2 diabetes. If ongoing research proves glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to be effective in reducing the risk of CVD onset in patients with obesity, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status, it will herald a new treatment paradigm in this setting, and now is the time for health care professionals to better recognize the benefit.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^1126RQHf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Our primary motivation was to investigate regimens that reduce costs and maintain high efficacy. Indeed, semaglutide and tirzepatide can cost more than $1000 per month in the US without insurance. While insurance subsidizes these medications for some patients, inadequate coverage limits access to these medications for tens of millions of Americans. Tirzepatide was recently made available in lower-priced vials, but these new offerings are only in the 2.5 and 5 mg dose sizes.

In addition to reducing costs, the dosing regimens that we analyzed may increase persistence and adherence. Indeed, less frequent dosing of GLP-1 products is associated with higher rates of persistence and adherence. While reference compares once-daily versus once-weekly doses, their results reflect the general principle that less frequent dosing tends to yield higher adherence. Furthermore, real-world persistence and adherence for GLP-1 products are major impediments to effective therapy. In fact, in a yearlong study of over 4000 people, Gleason et al. found that only 1 in 3 persons stayed on their GLP-1 and 27% took their medication as intended. Therefore, significant improvements in real-world efficacy may result from efforts to increase persistence and adherence, including by decreasing the dosing frequency.

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs in individuals who discontinue liraglutide and who switch from liraglutide to once-weekly injectable semaglutide [^111doaEb]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). High credibility.

The continued advancement in therapeutic options means that a patient's optimal treatment regimen may change over time, either with alterations in the patient's disease status or with the availability of new therapeutics. With the continued availability of new therapeutic options, patients and their providers may be able to further optimize therapeutic regimens and minimize discontinuations. In this study, switching from liraglutide to semaglutide was associated with lower healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs in the shorter term (e.g. 1 year) compared with discontinuation of liraglutide. In the longer term, switches that result in patients remaining on and being adherent to therapy may also reduce treatment burden by delaying treatment intensification or potentially even limiting the need for concomitant medications.

These benefits may be realized through greater therapeutic efficacy, but also through increased adherence and persistence due in part to patient-specific factors like less frequent dosing. Such practical factors, among others like medication tolerability and delivery device, emphasize the importance of efficient communication between pharmacists and physicians to identify people who may benefit from switching and the medications available to switch to.

### Reduced efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists therapy in people with type 1 diabetes and genetic forms of obesity [^112kXCPa]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Low credibility.

Once weekly Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RA) have been shown to improve glycemic outcomes and cause significant weight loss. However, 9% to 27% of individuals have little or no response to these drugs. In this article, we investigated the efficacy of GLP-1 RA therapy among adults with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely related to genetic mutations compared with obesity likely unrelated to genetic mutations.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, we compared body weight and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change with the use of GLP-1 RA therapy (including a dual agonist, Tirzepatide) over six months among adults with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely (n = 11, median age 39.5 years with a median BMI of 43.0 kg/m²) versus unlikely related to genetic mutation(s) (n = 15, median age 45.8 years with a median BMI of 38.7 kg/m²).

- **Results**: Six months of GLP-1 RA treatment resulted in a numerically lower reduction of weight (-5.75 ± 9.46 kg vs -8.65 ± 9.36 kg, P = 0.44) and HbA1c (-0.28 ± 0.96% vs -0.43 ± 0.57%, P = 0.64) among individuals with obesity likely versus unlikely related to genetic mutation(s), respectively. Fewer individuals with genetic obesity met goal weight loss ≥ 5% or HbA1c decrease ≥ 0.4% than did individuals with obesity unlikely related to a genetic cause (36.4% vs 80.0%, P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: The weight loss and glycemic lowering effects of GLP-1 RA therapy may be decreased in people with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely related to genetic causes. Further research is needed to understand GLP-1 RA mechanisms via energy regulation.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^115mvwEZ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP-1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, focusing on their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

- **Methods**: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to analyze the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

- **Results**: Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 on tirzepatide and 13,928 on semaglutide), with a mean age of 55.7 years (ranging from 52.0 to 63.7), and a mean follow-up of 35.9 weeks (ranging from 23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was -11.4% (from -15.3% to -8.27%) and -7.3% (from -8.3% to -6.08%), respectively. The meta-analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of -4.84 kg (95% CI: -6.21 to -3.47), favoring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate-severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

- **Conclusion**: Literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal- to moderate-severity AEs. Further research with comparative head-to-head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

### Longer-term liraglutide administration at the highest dose approved for obesity increases reward-related orbitofrontal cortex activation in response to food cues: Implications for plateauing weight loss in response to anti-obesity therapies [^115YHXss]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

GLP-1 analogs have recently risen to the forefront as effective medications for lowering weight through actions in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their actions in the CNS have not yet been studied in the human brain after longer-term administration at the highest dose approved for obesity (liraglutide 3.0 mg).

A total of 20 participants with obesity were treated with placebo and liraglutide (3.0 mg) in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial after 5 weeks of dose escalation. Neurocognitive and neuroimaging (fMRI) responses to food cues were examined at the clinical research center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

While using liraglutide, patients lost more weight (placebo-subtracted -2.7%; p < 0.001), had decreased fasting glucose (p < 0.001), and showed improved cholesterol levels. In an uncontrolled analysis, brain activation in response to food images was not altered by liraglutide vs placebo. When controlled for BMI/weight, liraglutide increased activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to food cues (p < 0.016, corrected for multiple comparisons).

In contrast to prior studies, we demonstrate for the first time that liraglutide treatment, administered over a longer period at the highest doses approved for obesity, does not alter brain activation in response to food cues. A counter-regulatory increase in reward-related OFC activation in response to food cues can be observed when neuroimaging data are controlled for BMI changes.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist usage in type 2 diabetes in primary care for the UK and beyond: A narrative review [^112i1j4A]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Body weight reduction was commonly observed in clinical trials evaluating GLP-1 RAs in people with T2D. Average changes in body weight in clinical studies of GLP-1 RAs, as stated in the summary of product characteristics, ranged from +0.9 to -6.5 kg. The weight reduction benefit with GLP-1 RAs, used as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies, has been demonstrated in various studies and is an important factor for consideration in the treatment of T2D.

The only exceptions were with liraglutide 1.2 mg OD and dulaglutide 0.75 mg OW, both of which had occasional weight gains, possibly due to the concomitant use of insulin or sulfonylurea (SU) in combination therapy. However, observed weight gains were marginally lower than those seen with the comparator medications in the clinical studies. The weight loss is usually sustainable in the presence of GLP-1 RA treatments, although there is some regain of lost weight upon cessation of GLP-1 RA treatments.

### Glp-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: A living benefit-harm modelling study [^111wDFtW]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

When accounting for all-cause discontinuation, instead of specific harm outcomes, the benefit-harm balance analysis showed that the probabilities of achieving a 10% weight loss with GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide, were all 1.00. For a 5% weight loss goal, the respective probabilities were 1.00 for semaglutide, 1.00 for liraglutide, 0.98 for tirzepatide, and 0.65 when considering all GLP-1 RAs combined.

### Switching to iGlarLixi versus continuation of a daily or weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes: A LixiLan-G trial subgroup analysis by HbA1c and GLP-1 RA use at screening [^1175gQdS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Change in weight by previous GLP-1 RA regimen**: Mean ± SD baseline weight was comparable between participants who switched to iGlarLixi and those continuing GLP-1 RAs, irrespective of previous GLP-1 RA regimen. In participants receiving QD/BID GLP-1 RA regimens at screening, LS mean ± SE change in weight from baseline to Week 26 was +2.1 ± 0.3 kg in those who switched to iGlarLixi and −1.4 ± 0.3 kg in those who continued on GLP-1 RAs; LS mean difference ± SE = 3.5 ± 0.4 kg, P < 0.0001. In participants receiving QW GLP-1 RA regimens at screening, LS mean ± SE change from baseline to Week 26 was +1.6 ± 0.3 kg in those switching to iGlarLixi and −0.8 ± 0.3 kg in those remaining on GLP-1 RA; LS mean difference ± SE = 2.4 ± 0.5 kg (P < 0.0001).

- **Hypoglycaemia by screening and previous GLP-1 RA regimen**: Overall, the incidence and rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (≤ 3.9 and < 3.0 mmol/L [≤ 70 and < 54 mg/dL]) were relatively low. Nevertheless, incidence and rates were higher in those who switched to the iGlarLixi therapy than in those who remained on GLP-1 RAs, irrespective of screening HbA1c or previous GLP-1 RA regimen. For each definition of hypoglycaemia, incidence and rates were highest in the QD/BID GLP-1 RA regimen subgroup.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: a real-world study [^1149nxXb]. Obesity (2024). Low credibility.

The high cost of novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) class agents often limits access and creates barriers to care. This real-world study evaluated the efficacy of older-generation generic antiobesity medications (AOMs) for weight maintenance after 1 year of GLP-1 RA therapy in patients who had achieved successful weight loss.

- **Methods**: We prospectively followed patients (N = 105) who had completed 12 months of therapy and were part of a "medical weight loss bundle", which included 12 months of GLP-1 RA therapy followed by 6 months of transition care. The baseline mean BMI was 36.4 kg/m². Body weight outcomes were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

- **Results**: After the medical weight loss bundle, 40 patients transitioned to generic AOMs. At 12 months, this cohort lost an average of 18.3% (95% CI [13.0%, 23.6%]) body weight from baseline, with a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m². At 18 months, they maintained the weight loss, with a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m². Subsequent follow-up visits (average 1.5 months later) without GLP-1 RAs showed further reduction, resulting in a total average weight loss of 25.5% (95% CI [23.1%, 27.9%]) compared to the initial visit.

- **Conclusions**: Patients successfully treated with GLP-1 RAs can maintain their weight loss using generic older-generation AOMs, suggesting potential cost savings for insurers and implications for policy regarding AOM coverage.

### Glp-1 receptor agonists: an updated review of head-to-head clinical studies [^113UGkgD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Summary of head-to-head trial data for GLP-1 receptor agonists**: In regards to weight, there is more ambiguity with the differentiation between agents. The long-acting agents tend to produce more significant weight loss compared with the short-acting agents, with semaglutide once again taking the lead on the greatest weight reduction. In terms of weight loss, the agents could be ranked (from most to least) in the following order: semaglutide > liraglutide > dulaglutide > exenatide XR = exenatide (twice daily) = lixisenatide.

- **Adverse effects**: GI adverse effects appear to be highest with the short-acting agents as well as subcutaneous semaglutide and appear to be lowest with exenatide XR. Injection site reactions may be more common with the longer acting agents, particularly exenatide once-weekly, which can cause transient small nodules at the injection site. However, patient satisfaction data indicate that once weekly injections result in higher patient satisfaction compared with twice daily injections. Comparing just the once weekly agents, patient satisfaction appears highest for dulaglutide, which is a single-use, disposable pen device that requires few steps.

Discontinuation rates due to adverse events vary between agents and studies, but are low overall with less than 10% of patients in the studies discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy due to adverse events. In clinical practice, discontinuation rates are likely to be higher, possibly due to less time and resources dedicated to patient education, support, and follow up. The risk of hypoglycemia is low with GLP-1 RAs.

### Duration-1: Exenatide once weekly produces sustained glycemic control and weight loss over 52 weeks [^1171MF28]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: In the Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in A1C, Weight and Other Factors Through Intervention with Exenatide Once Weekly (Duration-1) study, the safety and efficacy of 30 weeks of treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide once weekly (exenatide QW; 2 mg) was compared with exenatide BID in 295 patients with type 2 diabetes. We now report the safety and efficacy of exenatide QW in 1) patients who continued treatment for an additional 22 weeks (52 weeks total) and 2) patients who switched from exenatide BID to exenatide QW after 30 weeks.

- **Research design and methods**: In this randomized, multicenter, comparator-controlled, open-label trial, 258 patients entered the 22-week open-ended assessment phase (n = 128 QW-only; n = 130 BID→QW). A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, blood pressure, fasting lipids, safety, and tolerability were assessed.

- **Results**: Patients continuing exenatide QW maintained A1C improvements through 52 weeks (least squares mean -2.0% [95% CI -2.1 to -1.8%]). Patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW achieved further A1C improvements; both groups exhibited the same A1C reduction and mean A1C (6.6%) at week 52. At week 52, 71 and 54% of all patients achieved A1C 40 mg/dl, and body weight was reduced by > 4 kg after 52 weeks. Nausea occurred less frequently in this assessment period and was predominantly mild. No major hypoglycemia was observed.

- **Conclusion**: Exenatide QW elicited sustained improvements in…

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: A model-based approach [^113LdcBt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The global obesity epidemic continues to grow, with an estimated 38% of the world's adult population predicted to be overweight and 20% obese by 2030. Even though first-line interventions, such as diet and increased physical activity, can lead to weight loss, studies show that people tend to regain the lost weight in the long term. This is potentially due to well-regulated body weight homeostatic mechanisms and decreased effort regarding weight maintenance over time. Thus, effective and well-tolerated interventions are needed to aid with weight reduction and help sustain the lost weight in the long term.

Novel incretin hormone-based pharmacotherapeutic approaches have been proposed as a viable strategy for weight management in overweight or obese patients. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a member of the incretin hormone family that stimulates insulin secretion and dose-dependently inhibits glucagon secretion. It has been shown to lead to weight loss via a reduction in energy intake by increasing satiety and reducing hunger.

### Exposure-response analyses of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management [^1166fYj7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Liraglutide 3.0 mg, an acylated GLP-1 analogue approved for weight management, lowers body weight through decreased energy intake. We conducted exposure-response analyses to provide important information on individual responses to given drug doses, reflecting inter-individual variations in drug metabolism, absorption, and excretion.

- **Methods**: We report efficacy and safety responses across a wide range of exposure levels, using data from one phase II (liraglutide doses 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0 mg) and two phase IIIa SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (3.0 mg) and SCALE Diabetes (1.8; 3.0 mg) randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 4372).

- **Results**: There was a clear exposure-weight loss response. Weight loss increased with greater exposure and appeared to level off at the highest exposures associated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in most individuals but did not fully plateau in men. In individuals with overweight/obesity and comorbid type 2 diabetes, there was a clear exposure-glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) relationship. HbA1c reduction increased with higher plasma liraglutide concentration (plateauing at ∼21 nM); however, for individuals with baseline HbA1c > 8.5%, HbA1c reduction did not fully plateau. No exposure-response relationship was identified for any safety outcome, with the exception of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Individuals with gallbladder AEs, acute pancreatitis, or malignant/breast/benign colorectal neoplasms did not have higher liraglutide exposure compared with the overall population.

These analyses support the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^111Xctun]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The recent further developments of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA) have led to longer-acting compounds suitable for once-weekly injection. A weekly formulation of exenatide (exenatide QW, Bydureon; Amylin and Lilly Pharmaceuticals) became available in 2011. Albiglutide (GlaxoSmithKline), a human GLP-1 analog for once-weekly injection, is far advanced in development, as are other compounds on a human GLP-1 basis. Lixisenatide (Sanofi-Aventis) is a GLP-1 RA similar to exendin-4 for once-daily injection that is far advanced in clinical studies.

In the initial clinical studies with exenatide, performed in patients failing either on metformin or on sulfonylurea therapy or on a combination of both, additional exenatide treatment demonstrated a decrease of HbA1c versus placebo of 0.9–1.0%, accompanied by a weight loss of 1.6–2.8 kg. The patients with metformin as baseline therapy had the lowest rate of hypoglycemia and the best results concerning glycemic improvement and weight loss. In this group, the hypoglycemia incidence was not significantly increased compared with placebo. The higher hypoglycemia incidence in the sulfonylurea-treated patients was due to the use of the sulfonylurea, which exerts its insulinotropic action in a glucose-independent manner. The open 3-year study extension of this set of studies demonstrated a sustained HbA1c reduction of 1.0% and a weight loss of 5.3 kg in the study completers. Nausea was reported by approximately 40% of patients. This was mild to moderate and transient and led to a discontinuation of the drug in only ~5% of patients. These studies led to the approval of the first…

### Why do patients with obesity discontinue glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues [^113oKLQi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The final analysis included 350 patients, with a mean age of 45.7 ± 10.5 years, predominantly female (n = 283, 81%). Overall, the average treatment duration across all patients was 707 ± 425 days. Among these, 174 patients (50%) were classified as having discontinued obesity medication based on clinic records. Ultimately, 83 of the 174 patients (48%) responded to telephone follow-up, providing 123 reasons for discontinuation, as some gave multiple reasons. The median stay time was 1,028 days for patients on treatment and 394 days for discontinued patients. The total exposure time across the full cohort was 678.2 patient-years, based on the cumulative duration of therapy per individual.

Patients were treated primarily with semaglutide, followed by liraglutide. Of the 50% who continued treatment, 84.5% lost at least 5% of their body weight, 67% lost at least 10%, and 39.4% lost at least 15%. In contrast, among those who discontinued treatment, 58% had lost at least 5%, 32% had lost at least 10%, and 13% had lost at least 15%. The nadir weight loss at or before 1 year across all participants was 15.2% ± 8.4% (ranging from 6.8% to 23.6%). When stratified by persistence status, those who stayed on treatment achieved significantly greater weight loss at or before 1 year (17.8% ± 7.2%) than those who discontinued (12.6% ± 8.7%; p = 0.002). The median duration of treatment was 1,028 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 758–1,196 days) for patients who stayed on treatment, and 394 days (IQR: 210–582 days) for those who discontinued treatment.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^111ZKFqL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

- **Comparative effectiveness studies on weight loss**: In general, there were few large, methodologically strong head-to-head comparative effectiveness studies of weight loss in obese users of different GLP-1RA for weight loss. Liraglutide has been compared with dulaglutide, showing no clear difference in weight loss. In patients receiving GLP-1RA treatment for T2D or obesity, semaglutide use was more likely to lead to weight reduction of ≥ 10% compared with liraglutide use. In individuals without T2D, weight loss was 6.9% for semaglutide, 6.6% for liraglutide, and 3.1% for dulaglutide.

	- A newer large real-world comparative cohort study from the US of more than 18,000 adults with overweight or obesity compared weight loss during treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide. The treatment was labeled for T2D, yet only 52% of individuals in the study were classified as having T2D. The achieved treatment doses were not reported. The study found a larger weight loss at 12 months for tirzepatide (−15.3%) versus semaglutide (−8.3%) in individuals who had not been excluded due to discontinuation or GLP-1RA switching. Two recent studies based on the TriNetX database have compared users of tirzepatide with either users of semaglutide or other GLP-1RAs (combined). Anson et al. followed individuals after six months of completed treatment with tirzepatide and semaglutide and found that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and decreased risk of developing T2D in individuals without pre-existing diabetes compared with semaglutide at one-year follow-up.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^111id3oq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

As in all mathematical analyses of biomedical systems, our study has a number of limitations. Chiefly, as discussed above, the efficacy and safety of less frequent dosing regimens have yet to be documented in large populations of actual patients. For instance, we neglected patient variability in their pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses, though it is known that individual patients vary significantly in their weight loss outcomes from semaglutide and tirzepatide. Our calculations also assumed that patients persist in taking the medications with perfect adherence (i.e. no discontinuation of treatment and no missed doses), but in fact, persistence and adherence are significant problems for actual patients. Understanding how such patient variability and nonadherence affect our predictions presents an important avenue for future research.

Furthermore, in light of patient variability, it may be advisable for physicians to try different dose regimens with individual patients to determine the appropriate frequency and dose size required to sustain a desired weight. In fact, dose-dependent side effects may mean that some patients cannot tolerate a dose that is large enough to decrease dose frequency while still sustaining their weight loss target. For patients who cannot maintain once-weekly dosing, perhaps due to financial constraints, decreasing frequency is likely preferred to simply discontinuing their GLP-1 therapy, since complete discontinuation typically results in regaining two-thirds of the lost weight within one year. These limitations notwithstanding, our study highlights the potential utility of alternative dosing regimens.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: A real-world study [^115gamCH]. Obesity (2024). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 3, 69 out of 105 patients received GLP-1 RA therapy specifically during the MWLB for 12 months. Of these patients, 71% were treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg/week, 49% were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/week, 14.5% received oral semaglutide, 13% received dulaglutide, and 7% received tirzepatide. The utilization of GLP-1 RAs was greater than 100%, as more than one GLP-1 RA was used for an individual patient; this was done due to medication shortages, decreased efficacy, or side effects.

Of these 69 patients, 40 were transitioned to generic second-generation AOMs after the MWLB ended. Of the 69 patients, 80% were given metformin extended release, 20% were given phentermine, 32.5% were given topiramate, 32.5% were given bupropion, and 2.5% were given naltrexone to help maintain weight loss. However, upon transition to primary care, for weight maintenance, phentermine was avoided due to its controlled substance designation. On average, most patients required more than one generic AOM to help maintain weight loss after discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy, which is why utilization was greater than 100%.
