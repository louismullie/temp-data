## Question

What laboratory tests are recommended at an annual wellness visit for a 22-year-old female with hypertension, anxiety, and seasonal allergies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests to order at an annual wellness visit for a 22-year-old woman with hypertension, anxiety, and seasonal allergies, including what to prioritize, what to add for secondary causes, and what to avoid as unnecessary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal baseline hypertension workup. Then, I should consider cardiometabolic risk screening and ECG. Next, I will evaluate early-onset hypertension implications for secondary hypertension testing, especially primary aldosteronism. After that, I need to check whether thyroid testing is warranted given anxiety-like symptoms. I will also incorporate sex-specific considerations, clarify what not to order, and finally synthesize what to repeat annually versus once, ensuring each recommendation aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical driver and why this case needs more than routine care. Early-onset hypertension under age 40 raises the pretest probability of secondary causes and warrants an expanded evaluation beyond a minimal panel, and screening for hypertension-mediated organ damage is recommended even when other risk amplifiers are absent in this age group, so I should ensure the lab plan reflects this higher-yield workup in a young adult rather than a generic adult pathway [^111fcR2S] [^114eDiT2].

> I need to establish the baseline hypertension laboratory core, and I should double-check that I'm not missing essentials. Universal recommendations include assessing renal involvement and electrolytes: serum sodium, potassium, creatinine with eGFR, and urine testing for kidney damage; importantly, wait, I should verify whether a plain urinalysis is best here or if a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is preferred for sensitivity, and indeed ESC 2024 favors the albumin-to-creatinine ratio as the ideal initial test for renal involvement in hypertension, with repeat intervals driven by CKD status and clinical context [^1114ry3p] [^112mzThn] [^112mzThn].

> Next, I will now examine metabolic and cardiovascular risk screening because it materially alters long-term management even in young adults. Fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c should be obtained to screen for dysglycemia, and a fasting lipid profile should be measured to enable ASCVD risk stratification and preventive therapy planning; let me confirm HbA1c is acceptable for screening and diagnosis in this setting, and yes, standardized HbA1c is endorsed for diagnostic use when NGSP certified, while fasting glucose remains acceptable, so either approach is reasonable depending on availability and prior results [^112mzThn] [^113RFeJ4] [^114kWJK4].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiac baseline assessments that are guideline-based and practical for a 22-year-old. A 12-lead ECG is recommended in all patients with hypertension to screen for LVH, conduction abnormalities, and occult ischemia, even if asymptomatic at this age, and serves as a baseline for future comparison; I will avoid overpromising repeat intervals since guidelines emphasize baseline acquisition with repeats guided by clinical change rather than fixed annual schedules [^113pLW7Y] [^1134nmk5].

> Because the patient is under 40, I need to ensure appropriate screening for secondary hypertension. I should double-check the highest-yield test first, and the Endo-ERN 2024 guideline explicitly recommends screening for primary aldosteronism in any patient with early-onset hypertension, typically with an aldosterone–renin ratio, and ESC 2024 underscores comprehensive screening for main secondary causes in patients diagnosed before age 40, with tailoring for obesity and sleep apnea when present [^116tfr3W] [^114eDiT2].

> Let me consider the thyroid angle carefully, since anxiety, tremulousness, and insomnia can overlap with hyperthyroid symptoms. I should confirm that guidelines support thyroid testing in hypertensive patients with suggestive features, and indeed ACC/AHA 2017 recommends obtaining TSH and free T4 when hyperthyroid or hypothyroid symptoms are present, which fits this presentation and makes TSH plus free T4 reasonable here [^112J99hJ].

> I need to incorporate sex-specific and reproductive considerations without overreaching. Initially, I might say a pregnancy test is not routinely indicated at an annual wellness visit, unless she is on teratogenic antihypertensives or there is a possibility of pregnancy that would change management; wait, I should clarify this more precisely: Hypertension Canada advises repeating core labs and pregnancy testing with a frequency that reflects the clinical situation, so pregnancy testing is appropriate if results would immediately alter treatment decisions (for example, prior to starting or continuing ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or other teratogens), but it is not mandated routinely in all asymptomatic visits without such implications [^115NCHjR].

> Next, I should review what tests to avoid so we do not drift into low-yield, non-indicated screening. Allergy testing is not indicated for stable seasonal allergic rhinitis that is already clinically established and controlled, so serum allergy panels at annual wellness add little here; similarly, while some hypertension guidelines include a CBC, others do not, so CBC is optional rather than essential for hypertension-specific evaluation, and routine liver panel testing is unnecessary unless hepatotoxic medications or clinical clues mandate it, which helps avoid overtesting [^112FVUn4] [^116pA188] [^113RFeJ4].

> Let me now synthesize the annual follow-up cadence versus one-time screening to ensure I'm not overordering. For an annual wellness visit in a stable young adult with established hypertension, repeat electrolytes, creatinine with eGFR, glucose or HbA1c, and fasting lipids at least annually is reasonable in maintenance care, with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio preferred to dipstick when assessing renal involvement; ECG should be repeated based on new symptoms or interval changes rather than automatically, and aldosterone–renin ratio is typically a one-time screen unless clinical suspicion evolves or prior results were equivocal [^115NCHjR] [^1114ry3p] [^113RFeJ4].

> Putting this together, my final lab plan is as follows, and I should double-check each element against guideline anchors. Obtain urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or, if unavailable, urinalysis; serum electrolytes including sodium and potassium; serum creatinine with eGFR; fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c using standardized methods; a fasting lipid profile; TSH with free T4 given the anxiety and possible hyperthyroid overlap; and an aldosterone–renin ratio once if not previously done to screen for primary aldosteronism in early-onset hypertension, while reserving a baseline ECG if not already on file and avoiding routine allergy panels, with CBC as optional based on local wellness protocols rather than hypertension-specific need [^1114ry3p] [^112mzThn] [^114kWJK4] [^113pLW7Y] [^112J99hJ] [^116tfr3W] [^113RFeJ4].

---

For a 22-year-old female with hypertension, anxiety, and seasonal allergies, the annual wellness exam should include **CBC, CMP, lipid panel, fasting glucose or HbA1c, TSH, urinalysis, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio** to assess cardiovascular risk, metabolic status, renal function, and thyroid disease [^113RFeJ4]. Add a **12-lead ECG** [^113pLW7Y] [^1134nmk5] if hypertension is newly diagnosed or uncontrolled. Consider **secondary hypertension screening** (e.g. primary aldosteronism) [^116tfr3W] in young adults with early-onset hypertension [^114eDiT2]. Allergy testing is not routinely indicated unless symptoms are severe or refractory [^112FVUn4] [^116kyguJ]. Repeat labs annually or as clinically indicated [^115NCHjR], and monitor electrolytes and renal function if on antihypertensives [^notfound].

## Recommended laboratory tests

### Hypertension-related laboratory tests

Current guidelines **recommend** the following laboratory tests for the initial and annual evaluation of hypertension in young adults:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia or polycythemia, which can influence blood pressure and overall health [^113RFeJ4].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR), electrolytes (sodium, potassium), and liver function tests.

- **Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c**: Screen for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as hypertension increases cardiovascular risk [^114kWJK4] [^113Rmpb9].

- **Lipid panel**: Evaluate cardiovascular risk factors, including total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides [^112mzThn].

- **Urinalysis**: Detect proteinuria or hematuria, indicating potential renal involvement [^112mzThn].

- **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio**: Assess for microalbuminuria, an early marker of renal damage [^1114ry3p].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction, which can contribute to hypertension and anxiety symptoms [^112J99hJ].

- **12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Recommended for initial evaluation or if hypertension is uncontrolled, to assess for cardiac involvement [^113pLW7Y].

---

### Anxiety-related laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing for anxiety is **not generally recommended** unless clinically indicated; however, targeted tests may be considered to rule out medical conditions that can mimic or exacerbate anxiety symptoms:

- **TSH**: Already included above, to rule out thyroid dysfunction [^112J99hJ].

- **CBC**: Already included above, to rule out anemia or other hematologic conditions.

- **CMP**: Already included above, to assess electrolyte imbalances or metabolic disturbances [^113RFeJ4].

---

### Seasonal allergy-related laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing for seasonal allergies is **not typically required** unless symptoms are severe, refractory, or atypical. When clinically indicated, consider **allergy testing (skin prick or specific IgE blood tests)** based on symptom severity and patient history [^112FVUn4] [^116kyguJ].

---

## Frequency of laboratory testing

These laboratory tests are **generally annual**, unless clinical circumstances warrant more frequent monitoring — for example, when antihypertensive medications may affect renal function or electrolytes [^115NCHjR] [^1123DA34].

---

## Additional considerations

Given the patient's age and medical history, consider screening for **secondary hypertension**, as early-onset hypertension (< 40 years) may have an underlying secondary cause [^114eDiT2]. Screen for primary aldosteronism and other secondary causes when clinically indicated [^116tfr3W] [^115pQeUo].

Both guidelines recommend obtaining a personal and family history, performing a physical examination that includes measurement of blood pressure, and obtaining basic laboratory testing. Although the specifics of the latter overlap in requiring a fasting blood glucose, blood/serum sodium and potassium, lipid profile, serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinalysis, and ECG, there are discrepancies. The ACC/AHA guidelines exclusively recommend a complete blood count, serum calcium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, whereas the ESC/ESH guidelines uniquely recommend hemoglobin/hematocrit, blood uric acid, glycated hemoglobin A1c, liver function tests, a urine protein test, or ideally, a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

- **Optional tests**:
	- **ACC/AHA**: An echocardiogram, uric acid, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio.
	- **ESC/ESH**: Echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, cognitive function testing, and brain imaging. These additional tests can be used for the recognition of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD).

Thus, the assessment of HMOD and its implementation in risk stratification was an important consideration for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in the ESC/ESH guidelines.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2017 [^112kgBQJ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Changes in the 2017 adult immunization schedule from the previous year's schedule include new or revised ACIP recommendations for influenza, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccines:

- **Influenza vaccination**: Changes are related to the low effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist, MedImmune) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the United States during the 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 influenza seasons and revised recommendations for the use of the influenza vaccine among patients with egg allergy. These changes are reflected in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

	- LAIV should not be used during the 2016–2017 influenza season.

	- Adults with a history of egg allergy who have only hives after exposure to egg should receive age-appropriate inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV).

	- Adults with a history of egg allergy with symptoms other than hives (e.g. angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or emesis, or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention) may receive age-appropriate IIV or RIV. The selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.

### The annual physical examination: Important or time to abandon [^113D27uP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination, combined with the provider belief that the physical examination is of proven value and can detect subclinical illness, has led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country.

The authors review the forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults. They provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113Rmpb9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Glucose: Recommendation**: When glucose is used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, it should be measured in venous plasma A (high).

- **Glucose: Recommendation**: When glucose is used for screening of high-risk individuals, it should be measured in venous plasma B (moderate).

- **Glucose: Recommendation**: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes (Good Practice Point [GPP]).

- **Glucose: Recommendation**: Outcome studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of screening C (moderate).

- **Diagnosis/Screening**:

The diagnosis of diabetes is established by identifying the presence of hyperglycemia. For many years, the only method recommended for diagnosis was a direct demonstration of hyperglycemia by measuring increased glucose concentrations in the plasma. In 1979, a set of criteria based on the distribution of glucose concentrations in high-risk populations was established to standardize the diagnosis. These recommendations were endorsed by the WHO. In 1997, the diagnostic criteria were modified to better identify individuals at risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. The revised criteria comprised:

1. An FPG value ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL).
2. A 2-h postload glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during an OGTT.
3. Symptoms of diabetes and a casual (i.e. regardless of the time of the preceding meal) plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL).

If any one of these three criteria is met, confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day is necessary to establish the diagnosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in early pregnancy for patients with preexisting hypertension:

- **Serum creatinine**: Evaluation of renal function is critical.
- **Serum potassium**: Monitoring electrolyte levels is essential for managing hypertension.
- **Fasting blood glucose**: Important for screening and managing potential gestational diabetes.
- **Urinalysis**: Key in detecting proteinuria, indicative of preeclampsia.

Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically concerning the evaluation for thyroid disease, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining TSH and fT4 to screen for thyroid disorders in patients with hypertension and any of the following:

- **Hypothyroidism**: Dry and coarse skin, cold skin, cold intolerance, constipation, hoarseness, weight gain, delayed ankle reflex, periorbital puffiness, slow movement, and goiter.

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Heat intolerance, nervousness, tremulousness, insomnia, weight loss, diarrhea, proximal muscle weakness, lid lag, fine tremor of the outstretched hands, and warm and moist skin.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^113GhXGe]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

- **Detection and management of hypertension**: Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for the detection and management of secondary hypertension, the definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, and hypertension in older adults. They also address specific populations, such as men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

- **Strategies to improve adherence**: Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the importance of these strategies in hypertension management.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^1123DA34]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Laboratory tests:

- **Serum potassium**: The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, with 4.5 mEq/L often used as a reference point. If hypokalemia develops, corrective measures such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods should be taken. Institute these measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq/L require careful observation and treatment. Note that serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration; a rise in plasma pH may decrease plasma potassium concentration and increase intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium. Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

- **Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen**: Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules may produce elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or creatinine levels. This is apparently due to a reversible reduction of the glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity. Levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly individuals.

### Winrevair [^115PG6tZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: WINREVAIR may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential before starting WINREVAIR treatment.

- **Contraception**:
	- **Females**: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WINREVAIR and for at least 4 months after the final dose if treatment is discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
	- **Infertility**: Based on findings in animals, sotatercept-csrk may impair female and male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In male rats, although adverse histologic changes in reproductive organs were not reversible following a 13-week period, functional fertility demonstrated reversibility.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of WINREVAIR have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age.

- **Geriatric use**: A total of 81 patients ≥ 65 years of age participated in clinical studies for PAH, of which 52 (16%) were treated with WINREVAIR. No differences in efficacy of WINREVAIR were observed between the < 65-year-old and ≥ 65-year-old subgroups. With the exception of bleeding events (a collective group of adverse events of clinical interest), there were no differences in safety between the < 65-year-old and ≥ 65-year-old subgroups. Bleeding events occurred more commonly in the older WINREVAIR subgroup, but with no imbalance between age subgroups for any specific bleeding event.

### Recommendations for the allergy management in the primary care [^116pA188]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of patients seeking medical advice for allergic diseases are first seen in a primary care setting. Correct diagnosis and identification of all offending allergens is an absolute prerequisite for appropriate management of allergic disease by the general practitioner. Allergy diagnostic tests recommended for use in primary care are critically reviewed in accordance with the significant workload in a primary care setting. Simplified pathways for recognition and diagnosis of allergic diseases are proposed, which should be further adapted to local (national) conditions.

### Adherence to recommended laboratory testing for hypertension: Insights from a nationwide cohort [^1118UZvv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations, the prevalence of laboratory testing among patients newly diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) in the United States remains unknown. This study evaluated the prevalence of guideline-recommended laboratory testing in patients with newly diagnosed HTN.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX database of adults aged 18 years and older who were newly diagnosed with HTN between 2018 and 2023. Patients were stratified by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The primary outcome was the prevalence of laboratory testing within six months of diagnosis, including complete blood count (CBC), basic/complete metabolic panel (BMP/CMP), lipid profile, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting glucose, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram (ECG).

- **Results**: Among 2,052,702 patients (mean age 59.3 years, 47.3% female), testing completion rates were: CBC (40.8%), BMP/CMP (42.7%), lipid profile (17.0%), TSH (14.8%), fasting glucose (9.6%), urinalysis (21.9%), and ECG (36.3%). Older age (≥ 65 years) was associated with higher completion rates for CBC (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.19–1.20), BMP/CMP (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.16–1.17), TSH (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13–1.15), fasting glucose (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.32–1.35), urinalysis (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.18–1.20), and ECG (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.26–1.28). Female sex was associated with lower rates for CBC (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–0.99), BMP/CMP (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.96), lipid profile (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.89–0.90), ECG (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.96–0.97) but higher for TSH (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.25–2.17) and urinalysis (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.12–1.14).

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of laboratory testing in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension shows variability based on age and sex.

### The adult well male examination [^117UHZ5W]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The adult well male examination should incorporate evidence-based guidance toward the promotion of optimal health and well-being, including screening tests shown to improve health outcomes. Nearly one-third of men report not having a primary care physician. The medical history should include substance use, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, diet and exercise habits, and symptoms of depression. Physical examination should include blood pressure and body mass index screening. Men with sustained blood pressures greater than 135/80 mm Hg should be screened for diabetes mellitus. Lipid screening is warranted in all men 35 years and older, and in men 20 to 34 years of age who have cardiovascular risk factors. Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm should occur between 65 and 75 years of age in men who have ever smoked. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening men for osteoporosis or skin cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has provisionally recommended against prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer because the harms of testing and overtreatment outweigh potential benefits. Screening for colorectal cancer should begin at 50 years of age in men of average risk and continue until at least 75 years of age. Screening should be performed by high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every year, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years combined with fecal occult blood testing every three years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for testicular cancer.

### Tegretol XR [^112gxq2n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS), high-resolution HLA-B✱1502 typing is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B✱1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B✱1502 alleles are detected.

Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.

Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur (see PRECAUTIONS, General and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of active liver disease.

Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.

Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.

Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants.

### Incidence of hypertension among US Hispanics/Latinos: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, 2008 to 2017 [^113J6Q11]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

To identify individuals recommended for treatment of hypertension, the following variables were measured at the second examination: age, diabetes mellitus, CKD, prior CVD, and 10-year risk of the first CVD event. Diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose classification was measured from self-reported medication use, an oral glucose tolerance test, or fasting blood samples. It was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, an oral glucose tolerance test 2-hour post-load glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%, or self-reported use of hypoglycemic agents. CKD was defined as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m². Age at examination 2 was self-reported along with a history of CVD, which was defined as a prior heart attack, stroke, or heart procedure such as angioplasty, stent, or bypass. Among individuals without a history of CVD, the 10-year predicted risk of CVD was calculated using the pooled cohort risk equations.

For our primary analyses, of the 16,415 HCHS/SOL participants recruited from 2008 to 2011, we excluded individuals with hypertension (n = 5300) or missing hypertension information (n = 66) at examination 1, and those who did not show up (n = 4792) or were missing hypertension information (n = 86) at examination 2. Our final analytic sample included 6,171 participants. For our supplementary analysis using JNC7 to define hypertension, our analytic sample size was larger and included 7,730 participants free from JNC7-defined hypertension at examination 1.

### Vasomotor rhinitis [^111xNwqq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vasomotor rhinitis affects millions of Americans and results in significant symptomatology. Characterized by a combination of symptoms that includes nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, vasomotor rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion reached after taking a careful history, performing a physical examination, and, in select cases, testing the patient with known allergens. According to a 2002 evidence report published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there is insufficient evidence to reliably differentiate between allergic and nonallergic rhinitis based on signs and symptoms alone. The minimum level of diagnostic testing needed to differentiate between the two types of rhinitis also has not been established. An algorithm is presented that is based on a targeted history and physical examination and a stepwise approach to management that reflects the AHRQ evidence report and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals. Specific approaches to the management of rhinitis in children, athletes, pregnant women, and older adults are discussed.

### What would be the outcome if the American Diabetes Association recommendations of 2010 had been followed in our practice in 1998–2006 [^115ZTxAt]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In 2010, the American Diabetes Association published recommendations regarding the population to be screened for dysglycaemia; the diagnostic criteria for intermediate hyperglycaemia and diabetes using oral glucose tolerance testing and HbA₁c; and the patients eligible for treatment with metformin. We aimed to evaluate the consequences of screening with oral glucose tolerance test or HbA(1c) in an at-risk population.

Among 1177 overweight or obese consecutive adults without known diabetes who were referred to our department for weight management, we selected 1157 individuals (83% female; 80% European) fulfilling the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria for dysglycaemia screening.

The mean age was 41.2 ± 13 years, BMI 37.0 ± 7.2 kg/m², fasting plasma glucose 4.9 ± 0.8 mmol/l, and HbA₁c (turbidimetric immunoassay) 5.7 ± 0.7% (39 mmol/mol). Based on oral glucose tolerance test and HbA(1c), 76 (6.6%) and 113 (9.8%) patients had diabetes, including 34 sharing both criteria; 307 (26.5%) and 478 (41.3%) had intermediate hyperglycaemia; and 130 (11.2%) and 255 (22.0%) would be treated with metformin. The sensitivity/specificity of HbA₁c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for the diagnosis of diabetes according to the oral glucose tolerance test were 44.7/92.7%. Diabetes risk scores and UK Prospective Diabetes Study cardiovascular risk score were the highest in the 130 patients having both an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test and HbA₁c ≥ 5.7%.

In a population at risk for diabetes, the HbA(1c) strategy could lead to diagnosing more individuals.

### Differences across the lifespan between females and males in the top 20 causes of disease burden globally: A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^112jc28b]. The Lancet Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

Disaggregating data by sex and gender identity is crucial, yet it constitutes only the initial step in unraveling the roots of health disparities between men, women, and gender-diverse individuals. To effectively tailor responses that accommodate the life experiences and health challenges of all and promote changes, it is imperative to continue innovating in the analysis of secondary health data from a gender perspective. This involves acknowledging gender as a social construct and focusing on the power dynamics and societal norms, which are key drivers of health disparities.

An approach that includes multiple geographical and social contexts is crucial for pinpointing and addressing the particular health needs of diverse populations. For example, our analysis of HIV/AIDS indicated that aside from sub-Saharan Africa, where females faced significantly higher burden, males were disproportionately affected in all other regions. This pattern highlights the need for targeted policies and planning to address the specific risk behaviors, social dynamics, and access to health-care services of females and males in various parts of the world. Without granular and intersectional insights, the systemic barriers that sustain health inequities will remain unchallenged.

### Management of arterial hypertension: Challenges and opportunities [^113jkGKb]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The asymptomatic nature of hypertension (HTN), in conjunction with its disease burden, underlines the importance of routine blood pressure (BP) screening. According to the World Heart Federation (WHF), HTN screening should occur from the age of 18 and be repeated every two years, depending on the availability of resources. Meanwhile, guidelines have taken a more pragmatic approach, recommending repeat measurement between one and five years, depending on BP levels. Opportunistic screening for HTN and frequent measurement of BP is particularly relevant in high-risk individuals to increase awareness of HTN, enabling early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.

In addition, evidence suggests that setting-based screening programs improve the diagnosis and control rate of HTN. It should not be forgotten to exclude causes for secondary HTN, which can be managed, such as iatrogenic factors (including corticotherapy, NSAIDs, and vasoconstrictors), as well as renal, cardiovascular, endocrine diseases, or others.

Different equipment and techniques are used for BP measurement, and the accuracy of these devices varies widely, reducing the efficacy of mass BP screening programs to diagnose HTN accurately. Particularly in low-resource settings, access and procurement of validated and accurate BP machines remain a challenge. In agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) quality standard for BP machines, having enough calibrated and validated machines available to ensure screening and diagnosis should be a priority.

Out-of-office BP measurements — such as self-home BP monitoring (HBPM) or 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) — should be encouraged and are the recommended strategy for diagnosis.

### Utility of routine testing for patients with asymptomatic severe blood pressure elevation in the emergency department [^1147CKDC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of unanticipated, clinically meaningful test abnormalities in emergency department (ED) patients with asymptomatic, severely elevated blood pressure. Recommendations typically advise assessment for occult, acute hypertensive target-organ damage in these patients.

This research was conducted as a prospective observational study across three urban academic EDs. We enrolled consecutive patients who had a systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mm Hg during two measurements, provided they reported no symptoms of hypertensive emergency. Each patient underwent a basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, ECG, CBC count, and chest radiograph. We interviewed treating physicians about the indications for each test and whether abnormal results were anticipated based on clinical findings. Once the test results were available, physicians assessed whether the abnormal findings were clinically meaningful. Clinically meaningful results were those that led to unanticipated hospitalization, medication modification, or further immediate evaluation. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of unanticipated, clinically meaningful test abnormalities.

In the results, 109 patients with asymptomatic, severely elevated blood pressure were enrolled. Of these, 57 patients (52%) exhibited unanticipated abnormal test results. Clinically meaningful unanticipated test abnormalities were identified in 7 patients (6%): 2 cases in the basic metabolic panel (2%), 3 in the CBC count (3%), 3 in the urinalysis (4%), 2 in the ECG (2%), and in the chest radiograph.

### Fludrocortisone acetate [^111f958w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The physician should advise the patient to report any medical history of heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney, or liver disease, and to report the use of any medicines to determine if these might interact adversely with fludrocortisone acetate (see Drug Interactions).

Patients on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice.

The patient's understanding of their steroid-dependent status and increased dosage requirement under various stress conditions is vital. Advise the patient to carry medical identification indicating their dependence on steroid medication and, if necessary, instruct them to carry an adequate supply of medication for emergencies.

Stress to the patient the importance of regular follow-up visits to check progress and the need to promptly notify the physician of dizziness, severe or continuing headaches, swelling of feet or lower legs, or unusual weight gain.

Advise the patient to use the medicine only as directed, to take a missed dose as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next dose, and not to double the next dose.

Inform the patient to keep this medication and all drugs out of the reach of children.

Patients should be monitored regularly for blood pressure determinations and serum electrolyte determinations (see WARNINGS).

### Tasigna [^1149DvLm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Monitoring laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation, and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of Tasigna therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy, as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.

- **Fluid retention**: In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving Tasigna.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1137xiH3]. Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood, and high blood pressure (HBP) often begins in youth, evolving into hypertension (HTN) through repeated measures. Understanding the best practices for diagnosing, managing, and treating systemic HTN in children and adolescents is crucial for primary and subspecialty care providers.

- **Objectives**: To provide a technical summary of the methodology used to generate the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents", which updates the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents".

- **Data sources**: The review utilized Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Excerpta Medica Database references published between January 2003 and July 2015, followed by an additional search between August 2015 and July 2016.

- **Study selection**: The focus was on English-language observational studies and randomized trials.

- **Methods**: Key action statements (KASs) and additional recommendations were developed through a detailed systematic review of the literature, concerning the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HBP in youth. A content outline was used to define the scope, resulting in four patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, time questions. Key questions addressed include: (1) diagnosis of systemic HTN, (2) recommended work-up of systemic HTN, (3) optimal blood pressure (BP) goals, and (4) impact of high BP on indirect markers of cardiovascular disease in youth. After reference selection, a two-person review was conducted.

### Homeostasis model assessment: Insulin resistance and beta-cell function from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in man [^117QNGwV]. Diabetologia (1985). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" is essential for evaluating conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels, and it is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The HOMA-IR model provides insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be given in different units.

For fasting glucose, you can use:

- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

For fasting insulin, the options are:

- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are provided in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = [(fasting insulin in uIU/mL × fasting glucose in mg/dL)/405]

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: Allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly one in every six Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of two years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base.

### What methods are being used to create an evidence base on the use of laboratory tests to monitor long-term conditions in primary care? A scoping review [^115At98P]. Family Practice (2020). Low credibility.

The second-best approach is to use a quasi-experimental design, comparing the effect of an already implemented policy change, such as the publication of new testing guidelines. Routinely collected primary and secondary care data could then be used to perform an interrupted time series analysis. However, this is problematic because GP practices do not strictly follow the guidelines on testing, and the guidelines often do not give clear recommendations. Alternatively, a new testing strategy could be implemented in one area and compared to a demographically similar region. These approaches may be cheaper but can still be time-consuming because a long follow-up will be needed and are more prone to bias.

Finally, a retrospective comparative cohort study using routinely collected healthcare data may provide some insight into the benefits of using 'a lot of tests' versus using 'a minimal number of tests' and 'frequent testing' versus 'applying longer testing intervals'. Due to the large variation in testing between GP practices, irrespective of the population demographics they serve, these practices could be divided into those that tend to test often and those that tend to test less. Patients from 'high' and 'low' testing practices could be matched on demographic factors, co-morbidities, and disease severity. The differences in adverse outcomes specific to the disease and healthcare usage between both groups could be investigated. Although this approach would be much cheaper and time-saving, it will be difficult to investigate patient harms due to over-testing.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115XCax4]. JAMA (2020). Low credibility.

The prevalence of hypertension, both primary and secondary, in children and adolescents in the US ranges from 3% to 4%. Primary hypertension occurs primarily in children older than 13 years and has no known cause. However, it is associated with several risk factors, including family history and higher body mass index. In contrast, secondary hypertension primarily affects younger children and is most commonly caused by genetic disorders, renal disease, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular abnormalities.

To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, test accuracy, the effectiveness and harms of treatment, and the association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood.

This recommendation statement applies to children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years who are not known to have hypertension or who are asymptomatic.

The USPSTF concludes that evidence to support screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents (I statement).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, particularly in the context of initial evaluations, the ACEP 2013 guidelines advise against routine screening for acute target organ injury — such as serum creatinine, urinalysis, and ECG — in the emergency department for patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure (hypertension stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). It is recommended, however, to consider obtaining serum creatinine measurements to identify potential kidney injury, which could affect patient disposition, such as the need for hospital admission, in selected patients who might have poor follow-up.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: A comparison of the 2017 ACC/AHA, 2018 ESC/ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^1177HXWz]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

We utilized summary statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the US adult population aged at least 20 years who are noninstitutionalized and not on antihypertensive medication. This data was used to simulate a distribution of blood pressure measurements for 1,000,000 individuals. Each simulated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was taken as the individual's true SBP, representing their true underlying average blood pressure.

We applied estimates of within-person variability, in terms of coefficients of variation, to our population of true SBPs to generate observed SBPs across five independent sets of measurements. These sets represented an annual assessment of blood pressure over five years. Each measurement set included:

- **Average of two separate office measurements**: Taken in duplicate and repeated six weeks apart, equivalent to office blood pressure measurement;
- **1 day of ambulatory measurements**: Daytime average from 24-hour ambulatory monitoring;
- **1 week of home measurements**: Self-monitoring of blood pressure over seven days with replicate measurements taken twice daily, with the first day's data discarded, equivalent to home blood pressure measurement.

We derived the estimates of the coefficient of variation from the largest primary study, based on a randomized clinical trial of 163 subjects. Further details of the primary study for estimates of within-person variability are provided in the S1 Appendix.

Subsequently, we calculated the cumulative probability that at least one set of blood pressure measurements would be above a specified threshold of 130 mmHg for office/nonoffice measurements.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^11414n9t]. Hypertension (2022).

The guidelines for hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults were developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) through the collaboration of multiple contributors.

- **Guideline contributors**: To develop these guidelines, WHO established four groups:
	- An internal WHO Steering Group to coordinate the guideline development process.
	- A Guideline Development Group (GDG), composed of a diverse group of primary care and subspecialty physicians who were hypertension experts, pharmacists, nurses, health-oriented academics, a patient representative, and policymakers, to review the evidence and develop recommendations. The WHO selected the members of the GDG based on relevant expertise, considering appropriate representation by region and sex. An independent methodologist facilitated GDG deliberations.
	- An External Review Group, composed of technical experts, representatives of hypertension patient groups, and ministries of health from low-resource countries, to provide peer review of the guidelines.
	- An independent contracted systematic review group that conducted the overview of reviews and summarized evidence.

The guidelines were developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. In brief, the WHO Steering Group, in collaboration with the Guideline Development Group, formulated key questions and rated outcomes to identify critical elements for the development of the guidelines. Conflicts of interest were addressed in line with the Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics policy, and all members of the GDG completed the standard WHO Declaration of Interest forms, which were reviewed.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111mzPux]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for hypertension, specifically in relation to screening indications, the USPSTF 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for hypertension with office blood pressure (BP) measurement in adults aged 18 years and older. BP measurements should be taken outside the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before initiating treatment.

### Secondary arterial hypertension: When, who, and how to screen [^116WixjN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertension refers to arterial hypertension due to an identifiable cause and affects approximately 5–10% of the general hypertensive population. Because secondary forms are rare and the workup is time-consuming and expensive, only patients with clinical suspicion should be screened. In recent years, some new aspects have gained importance regarding this screening.

In particular, increasing evidence suggests that 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring plays a central role in the workup of patients with suspected secondary hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnea has been identified as one of the most frequent causes. Finally, the introduction of catheter-based renal denervation for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension has dramatically increased the interest and the number of patients evaluated for renal artery stenosis.

We review the clinical clues of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Specific recommendations are given as to the evaluation and treatment of various forms of secondary hypertension. Despite appropriate therapy or even removal of the secondary cause, BP rarely ever returns to normal with long-term follow-up. Such residual hypertension indicates either that some patients with secondary hypertension also have concomitant essential hypertension or that irreversible vascular remodeling has taken place. Thus, in patients with potentially reversible causes of hypertension, early detection and treatment are important to minimize or prevent irreversible changes in the vasculature and target organs.

### Odefsey [^112myiww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In Trial 1216, the median baseline eGFR was 104 mL per minute for participants who switched to Odefsey from FTC/RPV/TDF (N = 316), and the mean serum creatinine decreased by 0.02 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48. In Trial 1160, the median baseline eGFR was 110 mL per minute for participants who switched to Odefsey from EFV/FTC/TDF (N = 438), and the mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48.

- **Bone mineral density effects**: Changes in BMD from baseline to Week 48 were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Trials 1216 and 1160. In Trial 1216, mean bone mineral density (BMD) increased in participants who switched to Odefsey (1.61% lumbar spine, 1.04% total hip) and remained stable or decreased in participants who remained on FTC/RPV/TDF (0.08% lumbar spine, −0.25% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1.7% of Odefsey participants and 3.0% of FTC/RPV/TDF participants. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 0% of Odefsey participants and 1.2% of FTC/RPV/TDF participants.

	- In Trial 1160, mean BMD increased in participants who switched to Odefsey (1.65% lumbar spine, 1.28% total hip) and decreased slightly in participants who remained on EFV/FTC/TDF (−0.05% lumbar spine, −0.13% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 2.3% of Odefsey participants and 4.9% of EFV/FTC/TDF participants. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 1.4% of Odefsey participants and 3.3% of EFV/FTC/TDF participants.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114kWJK4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The role of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization has been a major barrier. With improved standardization through the NGSP and the IFCC, and new data demonstrating the association between HbA1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes. In making its recommendation, the Committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its preanalytical stability and decreased biological variation. Finally, the clinical convenience of the HbA1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests, compared with glucose-based diagnosis, convinced the Committee to recommend HbA1c testing for diagnosis.

A value ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic based on the observed relationship with retinopathy. For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay. The ADA indicates that although either an HbA1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred. The frequency of HbA1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA1c methods should be used to diagnose (or screen for) diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA1c should not be used for diagnosis.

### Kombiglyze XR [^113iCtvY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea. The percentage of patients who discontinued due to lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group.

The change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to Week 24 was also tested but was not statistically significant. The percentage of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested.

- **Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin plus an SGLT2 inhibitor**: A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline HbA1c of ≥ 7% to ≤ 10.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older, and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m². Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (≥ 1,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead-in treatment period.

### Position statement executive summary: Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114wiHZW]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Glucose meters**: There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening. The imprecision of the results, coupled with the substantial differences among meters, precludes the use of glucose meters for the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening for diabetes.

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. However, data are insufficient to claim an associated improvement in health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not known.

- **Patient instruction**: Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and conventional laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands.

- **Performance goals**: Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed. These targets vary widely and are highly controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of meters, with an intermediate goal of limiting total error for 95% of samples to ≤ 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to < 0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations, the European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews, as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposition.

### Undiagnosed hypertension among young adults with regular primary care use [^114q1ovv]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the United States. Blood pressures from young adulthood predict the incidence of future cardiovascular events. Among young adults (18–39 years), approximately 20% of men and 15% of women have diagnosed hypertension, with an expected increase in prevalence due to high obesity rates. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), rates of hypertension control have improved in the United States (defined per NHANES as an average SBP of < 140 mmHg and diastolic pressure of < 90 mmHg among patients with hypertension or self-reported use of blood pressure-lowering medication). However, young adults have consistently low prevalence of hypertension control (38%) compared with middle-aged (40–59 years) and older (≥ 60 years) adults, whose prevalence of control is 54 and 53%, respectively. This is concerning because young adults with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for chronic kidney disease and premature strokes, particularly in the presence of diabetes.

Unfortunately, prior studies report low hypertension diagnosis prevalence in young adults meeting criteria for hypertension. Reasons for this disparity are largely unknown. Limited studies identifying barriers to hypertension diagnosis in young adults have focused on lower primary care use and the lack of a regular source of primary care as contributing factors. However, a previous study demonstrated that young adult and middle-aged women (18–49 years) are less likely to be diagnosed with hypertension.

### Proleukin [^11132MZa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The following clinical evaluations are recommended for all patients prior to beginning treatment and then daily during drug administration:

- **Standard hematologic tests**: Include CBC, differential, and platelet counts.
- **Blood chemistries**: Include electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function tests.
- **Chest x-rays**: Essential diagnostic imaging.

Serum creatinine should be ≤ 1.5 mg/dL prior to the initiation of Proleukin treatment. All patients should have baseline pulmonary function tests with arterial blood gases. Adequate pulmonary function should be documented (FEV₁ > 2 liters or ≥ 75% of predicted for height and age) before initiating therapy.

All patients should be screened with a stress thallium study. Normal ejection fraction and unimpaired wall motion should be documented. If a thallium stress test suggests minor wall motion abnormalities, further testing is suggested to exclude significant coronary artery disease.

Daily monitoring during therapy with Proleukin should include vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration rate), weight, and fluid intake and output. In a patient with decreased systolic blood pressure, especially less than 90 mm Hg, constant cardiac rhythm monitoring should be conducted. If an abnormal complex or rhythm is observed, an ECG should be performed. Vital signs in hypotensive patients should be taken hourly.

During treatment, pulmonary function should be monitored regularly by clinical examination, assessment of vital signs, and pulse oximetry. Patients exhibiting dyspnea or clinical signs of respiratory impairment need special attention.
