## Question

What is an angiomyolipoma of the kidney?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an angiomyolipoma of the kidney is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and histology to anchor the diagnosis. Then, I should classify subtypes and clinical contexts. Next, I will review epidemiology and pathogenesis to frame risk. After that, I will examine clinical presentation and imaging features, including fat-poor disease pitfalls. Then, I need to assess bleeding risk stratification and thresholds for intervention. Finally, I will synthesize management pathways, including surveillance, embolization, surgery, and mTOR inhibitors, and I will close by highlighting special scenarios like epithelioid variants and TSC screening considerations [^1129XYbR] [^112pLjUa].

> Let me first confirm the core definition and histology so I do not build on a shaky premise. An angiomyolipoma is a benign mesenchymal renal tumor with a triphasic mix of thick-walled vessels, smooth muscle, and mature adipose tissue, and immunophenotypically it expresses melanocytic markers such as HMB-45 and Melan-A alongside smooth muscle actin, which helps distinguish it from renal cell carcinoma; tumor-to-tumor metastasis into AML is rare but reminds me to verify unusual histology carefully before concluding the diagnosis [^111sDVcy] [^1173LzH6] [^114TQHxU].

> Hold on, I should clarify the subtyping because this affects both imaging interpretation and behavior. Classic AML is the typical triphasic lesion, whereas the epithelioid variant can show more aggressive behavior and occasionally malignant potential, so I need to be cautious and not assume all AMLs are indolent; furthermore, AMLs can be fat-rich or fat-poor on imaging, with fat-poor lesions often mimicking RCC and requiring correlation or even biopsy to resolve diagnostic uncertainty, and I should also keep in mind the syndromic context of TSC or LAM versus sporadic cases [^111sDVcy] [^113xV2sM] [^113vf6xK] [^1129XYbR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the prevalence figures vary, I should double-check and reconcile them. Most comprehensive reviews place AMLs at roughly 0.2–0.6% of all renal masses in the general population, yet some series cite proportions up to about 3%, which likely reflects selection and ascertainment differences; there is a female predominance, and in TSC the prevalence is far higher, in the range of approximately 55–80% across cohorts, so I need to keep syndromic risk front-and-center when lesions are bilateral or multifocal in younger patients [^1129XYbR] [^111sDVcy] [^113N2anN] [^113652Hq].

> Let me consider the molecular pathogenesis next, because it informs targeted therapy. I need to ensure that biallelic inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2 with downstream mTORC1 hyperactivation is recognized as the principal driver across sporadic and TSC-associated AMLs, with biologic kinship to LAM and the broader PEComa family; experimental models and human genomic studies reinforce that TSC1/TSC2 loss is both primary and sufficient in many cases, which rationalizes mTOR inhibition as disease-modifying therapy in appropriate patients [^113652Hq] [^113N2anN] [^111ZLBjk] [^113hDHrL].

> I will now examine clinical presentation and the bleeding phenotype so I do not over- or under-treat. Most AMLs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally; when symptomatic, patients may have flank pain, hematuria, or acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage, historically linked to increasing tumor size, female sex of childbearing age, and syndromic disease; however, I should also consider that the proportion of the angiomyogenic component, not just absolute size, may better correlate with bleeding risk in some series, which affects how I counsel patients about surveillance versus intervention [^1129XYbR] [^1149bEY7] [^112VGkFW].

> Next, I should review imaging features with extra attention to fat-poor AMLs, because that is where misclassification risk is highest. Fat-rich AMLs show macroscopic fat on noncontrast CT with attenuation ≤ −10 HU and characteristic signal behavior on MRI with fat suppression, whereas fat-poor AMLs are typically homogeneously hyperdense on unenhanced CT, homogeneously low on T2-weighted MRI and ADC maps, and often demonstrate avid early enhancement with washout; chemical-shift MRI may show minimal signal drop only in a minority of fat-poor cases, so I should not over-rely on that single sign when the T2 and enhancement pattern are strongly suggestive [^113tXtTX] [^113QFStP] [^116m4m4F].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound and the need for follow-up in very small lesions. Ultrasound often reveals a hyperechoic lesion consistent with AML, but specificity is imperfect and extra-renal components confound accurate sizing; still, subcentimeter hyperechoic lesions with classic AML features rarely grow or prove malignant on follow-up, and small solitary AMLs under 20 mm generally exhibit negligible growth and may not require routine imaging surveillance in well-selected patients, although I should confirm stability if measurement reliability is uncertain [^116bFwrS] [^115sP18C] [^111u82dt].

> Let me now think through risk stratification and thresholds for action, and I should be careful not to anchor on a single number. The historical 4 cm threshold has guided many decisions, yet emerging data suggest size alone may overestimate risk and lead to overtreatment; aneurysm size ≥ 5 mm was once emphasized, but newer analyses question its predictive value, while an increased angiomyogenic proportion appears associated with bleeding; in practice, I should integrate symptoms, growth, composition, patient factors, and access to emergency care, and follow contemporary guidance recommending selective embolization or nephron-sparing surgery in patients with large tumors, women of childbearing age, inadequate follow-up or emergency access, or persistent pain or bleeding [^114G9yev] [^111gTc1M] [^112VGkFW] [^112pLjUa].

> I should double-check that surveillance remains a safe default for the right patients, because unnecessary procedures can impair renal function. Large retrospective cohorts show that most untreated AMLs, including many > 4 cm, demonstrate minimal or no growth over years and require intervention only infrequently, supporting active surveillance for asymptomatic, low-risk lesions with individualized imaging intervals, and this aligns with the broader literature that cautions against reflexive treatment based solely on diameter [^115Ae27W] [^111u82dt] [^1129XYbR].

> Now, I will evaluate embolization because it is pivotal in emergency and prophylactic settings. Selective transcatheter arterial embolization is effective for acute hemorrhage control and for prophylaxis in high-risk AMLs, achieving high technical success with meaningful size reduction, though reintervention rates over time are not trivial, particularly in TSC with multifocal disease, and outcomes can vary by embolic technique; I should counsel patients that embolization preserves parenchyma but may require staged or repeat procedures [^113kcwYE] [^1129XYbR] [^111qr5kP] [^116zA3Ke].

> Hold on, I should verify the durability and materials nuance, because that can matter in complex cases. Series using liquid embolics such as Onyx demonstrate substantial medium-term size reductions without hemorrhage recurrence and with stable renal function, and earlier long-term cohorts confirm good safety with occasional need for repeat embolization, particularly for very large or syndromic tumors, which I should factor into longitudinal planning and follow-up imaging schedules [^111mAuna] [^112ZLHLC] [^11295hx3].

> Let me consider surgery next and be precise about indications. Nephron-sparing surgery is preferred when malignancy cannot be excluded, when anatomy is unfavorable for embolization, or when tumors are large, complex, or recurrent, and modern series show low recurrence and excellent renal preservation; guidelines also allow consideration of nephron-sparing surgery for bleeding AMLs depending on local expertise, and comparative data suggest that surgery, like embolization, may entail a greater interim GFR decline than surveillance, underscoring the need to individualize choices [^112Awkfv] [^111DxHGK] [^112NmbLF].

> I need to check the role of mTOR inhibitors carefully and align with regulatory-quality evidence. Everolimus is first-line systemic therapy for TSC-associated or sporadic LAM-associated AMLs without an immediate surgical indication, with EXIST-2 and its extension showing durable volume reductions of ≥ 50% in a substantial proportion and no renal bleeding events on therapy, and the FDA labeling details dosing, response criteria, and monitoring, so I should integrate this option early in bilateral, multifocal, or surgically challenging disease [^111BPMa9] [^115Lc6pi] [^1134TX8V].

> But wait, what if the AML is epithelioid or behaves atypically. In suspected epithelioid AMLs, which can be lipid-poor and demonstrate aggressive features on imaging and histology, I should escalate concern for malignant potential and manage more like RCC with surgical excision and closer follow-up, acknowledging that consensus is limited and evidence remains heterogeneous, which argues for multidisciplinary review and pathology correlation before finalizing the plan [^113xV2sM] [^114QvcFH].

> Next, I should review syndromic screening implications so I do not miss TSC or LAM in the appropriate context. The presence of bilateral or multiple AMLs in patients aged 18–40 years should prompt evaluation for TSC, and if present, multidisciplinary care including genetic counseling and surveillance for LAM is warranted; respiratory society guidance also reminds me to screen for renal AMLs in LAM and to address bleeding risk before lung transplantation, reinforcing the tight linkage between these entities [^112xHKC5] [^117X6iAs] [^115LmnkL] [^113N2anN].

> I should confirm one more imaging nuance so I do not overstate diagnostic certainty. While MRI can achieve very high specificity for AML, including many fat-poor cases, I must be cautious that not every fat-invisible lesion is decisively characterized, and in equivocal scenarios, percutaneous biopsy may be appropriate to exclude RCC, particularly when management would change based on a definitive diagnosis, though I should balance biopsy yield against procedural risks and the potential that results may not alter care in small masses [^1129XYbR] [^113QFStP] [^116W32Nz].

> In summary, renal angiomyolipoma is a triphasic, mTOR-driven benign neoplasm that is often indolent yet capable of life-threatening hemorrhage; accurate imaging characterization, nuanced bleeding risk assessment that goes beyond size alone, and individualized management spanning surveillance, selective embolization, nephron-sparing surgery, and mTOR inhibition for TSC/LAM-associated disease provide the best framework for care, with special vigilance for epithelioid variants and syndromic presentations that warrant escalated evaluation and follow-up [^1129XYbR] [^112pLjUa] [^1134TX8V].

Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a **benign renal tumor** [^111sDVcy] composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat [^114PsnKK], most often detected incidentally on imaging [^116m4m4F]. It is a **benign tumor that can bleed**, especially when > 4 cm or with aneurysms [^114PsnKK] [^113op6K2], and is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) [^113N2anN] [^113652Hq]. Diagnosis relies on identifying intralesional fat on CT/MRI [^113tXtTX] [^113QFStP]; fat-poor AMLs may need biopsy to exclude malignancy [^113vf6xK]. Management is size- and symptom-based: small asymptomatic lesions are surveilled, while larger or symptomatic tumors are treated with embolization [^111qr5kP], nephron-sparing surgery, or mTOR inhibitors in TSC [^112pLjUa] [^1134TX8V] [^111BPMa9]. Prognosis is **excellent** [^111sDVcy] [^114PsnKK], but epithelioid variants can be aggressive and require closer follow-up [^114QvcFH].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

AMLs account for **~3% of renal masses**, with 80% sporadic and 20% TSC-associated [^114PsnKK]. There is a **female predominance**, particularly in sporadic cases [^1129XYbR]. AML is strongly linked to TSC; TSC-associated tumors are often bilateral, multiple, and larger [^113N2anN] [^113652Hq].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Incidental detection**: Most are found incidentally on imaging [^116m4m4F] [^111u82dt].
- **Symptoms**: Flank pain, hematuria [^114PsnKK], palpable mass, or acute hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) [^111qr5kP].
- **TSC-associated AMLs**: More likely bilateral, multiple, and symptomatic [^113N2anN] [^112xHKC5].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Ultrasound**: Hyperechoic renal mass, often with posterior acoustic shadowing [^116bFwrS] [^115sP18C].
- **CT**: Intralesional fat (≤ −10 HU) is diagnostic; fat-poor AMLs are hyperdense and enhance homogeneously [^113tXtTX] [^113QFStP].
- **MRI**: Fat suppression confirms fat; fat-poor AMLs are T2 hypointense with avid early enhancement and washout [^113tXtTX] [^113QFStP].
- **Biopsy**: Consider for fat-poor lesions to exclude RCC [^113vf6xK] [^114PsnKK].

---

## Histopathology

Classic AML shows a **triphasic mix** of thick-walled vessels, smooth muscle, and mature fat [^112fRDKN]. The **epithelioid variant** is predominantly epithelioid and has **malignant potential** [^114QvcFH]. Immunohistochemically, HMB-45, Melan-A, and SMA are positive, whereas epithelial markers are negative [^1173LzH6] [^112fRDKN].

---

## Complications

- **Hemorrhage**: Risk rises with size (> 4 cm) and aneurysms [^114PsnKK] [^113op6K2].
- **Renal impairment**: From large or multiple lesions [^112NmbLF].
- **Malignant transformation**: Rare, mainly in epithelioid AMLs [^112fRDKN] [^113xV2sM].

---

## Management strategies

| **Tumor size and symptoms** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| - < 4 cm <br/> - Asymptomatic | Active surveillance with periodic imaging [^111sDVcy] [^115Ae27W] [^111u82dt] |
| - ≥ 4 cm <br/> - Symptomatic <br/> - Aneurysm ≥ 5 mm | Selective arterial embolization (SAE) or nephron-sparing surgery [^112pLjUa] [^113op6K2] [^111qr5kP] |
| - TSC-associated <br/> - Multiple <br/> - Unresectable | mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) [^1134TX8V] [^111BPMa9] |
| Fat-poor or suspicious for malignancy | Partial nephrectomy or biopsy [^113tXtTX] [^113vf6xK] |

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **excellent** for classic AMLs; epithelioid variants require closer surveillance [^114PsnKK] [^114QvcFH]. Follow-up includes **regular imaging** to monitor growth and complications [^111u82dt] [^115Ae27W].

---

Renal angiomyolipoma is a benign renal tumor with a **risk of bleeding** profile, especially when large or aneurysmal. Management is individualized by size, symptoms, and TSC status, with surveillance for small lesions and intervention for larger or symptomatic tumors.

### Case report and literature review of complex renal angiomyolipoma [^111sDVcy]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipoma (AML), or renal hamartoma, is the most common benign renal tumor, accounting for approximately 3% of all renal masses. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies AML into two types: classic and epithelioid. Classic AML is characterized by varying proportions of thick-walled mature blood vessels, spindle or epithelioid smooth muscle cells, and adipose tissue. In contrast, epithelioid AML features prominent epithelioid components, including spindle cells and giant cells, and tends to exhibit more aggressive behavior than typical benign angiomyolipoma.

Although 80% of AMLs are sporadic, approximately 20% are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Abdominal masses are a common disease. Based on the severity of the mass, they can be divided into malignant tumors and benign tumors. According to the location of the mass, they can be classified as abdominal wall tumors, abdominal organ tumors, and retroperitoneal tumors.

Patients with abdominal masses usually do not notice any conscious symptoms. When pain occurs, the condition has often become very serious, resulting in missing the best treatment opportunity. Therefore, it is crucial to make a clear diagnosis of patients with abdominal masses as soon as possible. For the diagnosis of a huge abdominal mass in this case, it is still necessary to consider whether there are other coexisting tumors, especially in patients with bilateral renal space occupying lesions. It is essential to distinguish the rare coexistence of renal cell carcinoma and retroperitoneal tumors. Clinically, AML presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment.

### Renal angiomyolipoma without visible fat: Can we make the diagnosis using CT and MRI [^113tXtTX]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas without visible fat (AML.wovf) are benign masses that are incidentally discovered mainly in women. AML.wovf are typically homogeneously hyperdense on unenhanced CT without calcification or haemorrhage. Unenhanced CT pixel analysis is not useful for diagnosis. AML.wovf are characteristically homogeneously hypointense on T2-weighted (T2W)-MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Despite early reports, only a minority of AML.wovf show signal intensity drop on chemical-shift MRI due to microscopic fat. AML.wovf most commonly show avid early enhancement with washout kinetics at contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. The combination of homogeneously low T2W and/or ADC signal intensity with avid early enhancement and washout is highly accurate for the diagnosis of AML.wovf.

- **Key points**:
	- AML.wovf are small incidental benign renal masses occurring mainly in women.
	- AML.wovf are homogeneously hyperdense with low signal on T2W-MRI and ADC map.
	- AML.wovf typically show avid early enhancement with washout kinetics.
	- Combining features on CT/MRI is accurate for the diagnosis of AML.wovf.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: Findings from the Tuberous Sclerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^113N2anN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from inherited or sporadic germline mutations of TSC1 or TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively. It is characterized by hamartomatous lesions in multiple organs, including the brain, kidney, skin, heart, lungs, and retina.

Renal problems are very frequent in patients with TSC, following neurological manifestations and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipoma, epithelial cysts, polycystic kidney disease, and renal cell carcinoma. The occurrence rate and clinical characteristics of renal lesions in TSC have been assessed primarily in either single- or two-centre case series or in population-based studies with small sample sizes yielding varied findings. The estimated prevalence of angiomyolipoma varied between studies and ranged from 55% to 80%. Some studies showed a higher proportion of renal angiomyolipoma in females, whereas others have shown no gender disparity. Patients with TSC2 mutations have been reported to exhibit a higher incidence and severity of angiomyolipoma compared with patients with TSC1 mutations. Patients with TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma are susceptible to spontaneous life-threatening haemorrhage.

Despite considerable progress in the understanding of TSC and associated renal manifestations, there is a need for a large population-based cohort study to better understand the clinical characteristics and natural history of renal angiomyolipoma in patients.

### Everolimus for renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis: extension of a randomized controlled trial [^1134TX8V]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment for renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (sporadic LAM), but follow-up is limited. Longer-term efficacy and tolerability data from a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are presented.

- **Methods**: Following favorable results from the primary analysis (data cutoff 30 June 2011) of the EXIST-2 trial, patients still receiving study treatment were allowed to enter an open-label extension. Everolimus was initiated at 10 mg once daily and titrated based on tolerability. The primary outcome was the angiomyolipoma response rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in target lesion volumes). Safety was a secondary endpoint.

- **Results**: As of the cutoff date (1 May 2013), 112 patients had received everolimus. The response rate in 107 patients with angiomyolipoma (median duration of medication exposure of 28.9 months) was 54%. The proportion of patients achieving angiomyolipoma reductions of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% increased over time, reaching 81.6% (62/76) and 64.5% (49/76), respectively, by Week 96. No everolimus-treated patients experienced renal bleeding. The long-term safety profile was consistent with previous reports; adverse events (AEs) were mostly Grade 1/2, and there were no new safety issues. The frequency of emerging AEs and severe AEs lessened over time.

- **Conclusions**: Longer-term everolimus treatment appeared safe and effective in patients with TSC- or sporadic LAM-associated renal angiomyolipoma.

### Controversies related to epithelioid variant of renal angiomyolipoma: a review of the literature [^114QvcFH]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a review of the epithelioid-type angiomas to determine their clinical course and propose an appropriate plan for follow-up. We present the case of a patient with possible adrenal carcinoma suggested by computed tomography, for whom the histopathologic study revealed an epithelioid angiomyolipoma arising from the kidney. In the absence of consensus, we consider it worthwhile to register the very few cases diagnosed and record a detailed follow-up of the clinical course. We recommend surgical treatment and a follow-up regimen similar to that for renal carcinoma.

### Can subcentimetre ultrasound detected angiomyolipomas be safely disregarded [^115sP18C]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

To optimize follow-up, lesions on baseline ultrasound (US) can be dismissed if renal lesions conform to the US criteria of an angiomyolipoma (AML).

The present study was a 10-year retrospective review of patients with incidental hyperechoic renal lesions on US to ascertain outcomes from subsequent imaging, clinical encounters, and cancer registrations. Exclusions included renal calculi, tuberous sclerosis, Von-Hippel-Lindau, or a known cancer.

After excluding 39 patients, 1,493 patients were identified. One hundred and sixty had more than one lesion, with 87 patients having bilateral lesions. Regardless of indication, 889 patients had subsequent imaging within 5 years (59.5%). The average size of all AMLs was 13.2 mm. In the group with lesions that were < 10 mm (807), 438 had imaging follow-up with an average follow-up time of 1.5 years. Mean lesion size in this group was 7 mm, with an average increase of < 0.5 mm on follow-up. No lesions were found to be malignant on subsequent imaging, nor did any of these patients have a subsequent renal cancer diagnosis registered at local multidisciplinary team meetings.

No incidental subcentimetre hyperechoic renal lesion with imaging characteristics of an AML demonstrated significant growth or developed into a malignancy on follow-up.

### Case report and literature review of complex renal angiomyolipoma [^116W32Nz]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma depends on B-ultrasound, CT, MRI, and other imaging examinations. At present, ultrasound diagnostic technology has been widely applied in clinical practice, and the quality of ultrasound images has also been greatly improved, which has enhanced the effectiveness and accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis. Ultrasound can effectively reflect the location, size, and relationship between the patient's abdominal mass and surrounding tissues; therefore, ultrasound should be the preferred method for examining abdominal masses.

The ultrasonic manifestations of renal angiomyolipoma are mainly high echogenicity, which has high diagnostic value for lumps with ruptured hemorrhage. However, further examination with CT and MRI is feasible for masses that cannot be clearly diagnosed. CT and MRI can diagnose angiomyolipoma mainly by determining the presence of adiposity in the tumor. The imaging characteristic of adiposity in the tumor on CT is lesion attenuation ≤ −10 HU, and the tumor to spleen ratio on MRI is 16.5%. Angiomyolipomas with little or no fat are difficult to diagnose by imaging. To distinguish from kidney malignancy, percutaneous renal biopsy is feasible for further diagnosis. However, the issue of whether to encourage the use of renal biopsy technology for diagnosing kidney tumors has attracted widespread attention. Considering the safety and effectiveness of biopsy, in some cases, renal mass biopsy may not change the clinical treatment of small renal mass patients. On the other hand, renal tumor biopsy may help identify some predictive factors.

### Safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial embolization in renal angiomyolipomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kcwYE]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) stands as a pivotal intervention in the management of renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), demonstrating a robust capability for inducing tumor reduction. The success of TAE intervention for renal AMLs hinges on tumor size reduction, a parameter consistently validated across the literature. The process begins with the catheterization of the arterial supply to the AML, a step meticulously guided by advanced imaging modalities such as CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Once the catheter is appropriately positioned, embolic agents are deployed to occlude the vessels supplying the tumor.

Our meta-analysis explored multiple parameters to identify how TAE led to tumor size reduction. We found a mean tumor reduction of 1.848 cm, reflecting findings from previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews. For instance, Lin et al. (2019) and Murray et al. (2015) reported reductions of 2.09 cm and 3.4 cm, respectively. Additionally, our meta-analysis revealed a mean tumor size reduction of 43.298%. These findings are consistent with Lin et al. (2019), which reported a 30% tumor size reduction. Abouelkheir et al. (2022) identified a significant positive correlation between tumor size reduction and the initial tumor size. This correlation is crucial for intervention considerations, as there is an ongoing debate in the literature about the correct indication for TAE intervention based on the size of the renal tumor.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of renal angiomyolipoma [^114PsnKK]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Advances in minimally invasive therapies and novel targeted chemotherapeutics have provided a breadth of options for the management of renal masses. Management of renal angiomyolipoma has not been reviewed comprehensively in more than a decade. This paper provides an updated review of the diagnosis and management strategies for renal angiomyolipoma.

We conducted a PubMed® search of all available literature for renal or kidney angiomyolipoma. Further sources were identified in the reference lists of identified articles. Specifically, we reviewed case series of partial nephrectomy, selective arterial embolization, and ablative therapies, as well as trials of mTOR inhibitors for angiomyolipoma from 1999 to 2014.

Renal angiomyolipoma is an uncommon benign renal tumor. Although associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, these tumors also occur sporadically. The risk of life-threatening hemorrhage is the main clinical concern. Due to the fat content, angiomyolipomas are generally readily identifiable on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, fat-poor angiomyolipoma can present a diagnostic challenge. Novel research suggests that various strategies using magnetic resonance imaging, including chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging, have the potential to differentiate fat-poor angiomyolipoma from renal cell carcinoma. Active surveillance is the accepted management for small asymptomatic masses. Generally, symptomatic masses and masses greater than 4 cm should be treated.

### Renal angiomyolipoma: Long-term results after arterial embolization [^11295hx3]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Selective arterial embolization of renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) was performed to prevent hemorrhage in patients with AMLs larger than 4 cm. This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy of AML embolization.

- **Materials and methods**: Nineteen patients underwent embolization for 30 renal AMLs between July 1991 and June 2002. Of these, 10 patients had tuberous sclerosis (TS) with multiple AMLs, and nine patients had a solitary sporadic AML. Embolization was performed using ethanol mixed with iodized oil (Ethiodol) in 29 tumors; coils were used in addition to the ethanol/Ethiodol mixture in one case. All tumors were completely embolized according to angiographic criteria, including vascular stasis and absence of arterial feeders. The efficacy of embolization was determined over a mean follow-up period of 51.5 months (range, 6–132 months). Recurrence was defined as an increase in tumor size of greater than 2 cm on follow-up imaging and/or symptoms that required repeat embolization. An institutional review board exemption was obtained to perform this retrospective study.

- **Results**: Embolization of the renal AMLs was technically successful in all 19 patients and for all 30 lesions. AML recurrence was noted in 31.6% of patients (n = 19) and for 30% of lesions overall (n = 9). Six of 10 patients in the TS group had AML recurrences. No recurrences occurred in the patients with sporadic AML. In the TS group of 10 patients, there was a total of 21 AMLs and the overall tumor recurrence rate was 42.9% (nine of 21). Six lesions in four patients had to be addressed.

### Renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis — rare but potentially life-threatening lesions [^115ayuXc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

We discuss an 18-year-old girl diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis complex and known to have renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). Despite having no regular urological follow-up, she presented with left-sided abdominal pain and haematuria on urine dipstick testing at the out-of-hours General Practitioner (GP) service. She was initially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis and discharged with simple analgesia and antibiotics. Subsequent imaging of her renal tract demonstrated multiple large AMLs with evidence of recent bleeding, which required arterial embolisation.

### The role of partial nephrectomy for the management of sporadic renal angiomyolipoma [^112Awkfv]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiomyolipoma is a benign renal tumor with a tendency to grow over time, potentially leading to local complications. Due to the benign nature of these lesions, renal-preserving treatments are recommended. Nephron-sparing surgery has been evaluated in our practice for treating renal angiomyolipoma.

- **Methods**: We reviewed our institutional nephrectomy registry to identify patients who underwent nephron-sparing surgery for renal angiomyolipoma from 1970 to 2004. Patients with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis were excluded. This study recorded patient demographics, perioperative complications, and postoperative outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 58 patients who underwent nephron-sparing surgery for sporadic renal angiomyolipoma, comprising 44 women and 14 men. The median tumor size was 3.9 cm, with a range of 0.8–12.5 cm. In 7 patients (12%), several ipsilateral angiomyolipomas were resected, whereas 2 patients underwent surgery for bilateral angiomyolipomas. The early complication rate was 12%, with 3 patients (5%) experiencing a urine leak. Over a median postoperative follow-up of 8 years (range, 1–31 years), 2 patients (3.4%) exhibited radiographic evidence of local recurrence, although no patient experienced symptom recurrence. The median preoperative serum creatinine level was 1.0 mg/dL (range, 0.5–3.9 mg/dL), and at last follow-up, it was 1.1 mg/dL (range, 0.6–3.6 mg/dL). None of the patients developed de novo chronic renal insufficiency following surgery, including 4 patients treated for angiomyolipomas in a solitary kidney.

- **Conclusions**: Nephron-sparing surgery for sporadic renal angiomyolipoma demonstrates promising outcomes in renal preservation and shows a low complication rate with no development of chronic renal insufficiency in the studied cohort.

### CT imaging findings of renal epithelioid lipid-poor angiomyolipoma [^113xV2sM]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

To identify specific imaging and clinicopathological features of a rare potentially malignant epithelioid variant of renal lipid-poor angiomyolipoma (E-lpAML), a study was conducted involving 20 patients with E-lpAML and 43 patients with other lipid-poor angiomyolipomas (lpAML). The study retrospectively included these patients, examining their multiphase computed tomography (CT) imaging features alongside clinicopathological findings. Independent predictors for E-lpAML were identified using multivariate logistic regression and were employed to construct a diagnostic score to differentiate E-lpAML from other lpAML.

The E-lpAML group comprised 6 men and 14 women, with a median age of 39.45 years (SD ± 15.70, ranging from 16.0 to 68.0 years). E-lpAML typically appeared as hyperdense mass lesions, located at the renal sinus (8 cases, 40%) or the renal cortex (12 cases, 60%). These lesions exhibited a "fast-in and slow-out" enhancement pattern (seen in all cases, 100%), cystic degeneration (18 cases, 90%), an "eyeball" sign (11 cases, 55%), and tumor neo-vasculature (15 cases, 75%) on CT imaging.

- **Multivariate logistic regression analysis**: This analysis revealed that the independent predictors for diagnosing E-lpAML were the presence of cystic degeneration on CT imaging and the CT value of the tumor during the corticomedullary phase of enhancement.

A predictive model using these two predictors was developed, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.5% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 84.3–98.2%), with a sensitivity of 95.0% (95%CI: 75.1–99.9%) and a specificity of 83.72% (95%CI: 69.3–93.2%).

In conclusion, specific CT imaging features and predictors were identified that could assist in the accurate diagnosis of E-lpAML. These findings should be beneficial for clinical practice and further research.

### Renal angiomyolipoma-investigating radiological signs indicative of risk for bleeding [^1149bEY7]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Tumor tissue composition (n = 48).

Bleeding angiomyolipomas were slightly smaller at embolization in terms of axial diameters (6.5 cm vs. 7.5 cm) and total volumes (111 cm³ vs. 132 cm³), though these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.69) (Table 3). Most angiomyolipomas contained more fatty tissue than blood vessels or smooth muscle.

The median angiomyogenic component volume was 12 cm³ (3–50), with bleeding tumors showing a higher median volume (27 cm³) compared to non-bleeding ones (8 cm³), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.11) (Fig. 2a). Non-bleeding tumors were predominantly in the 0–10 cm³ category of angiomyogenic component volume, where only 19% (4/21) bled (Fig. 3a).

- **Figure 2a**: Distribution of the volume of the angiomyogenic component, encompassing blood vessels and muscle, in 48 angiomyolipomas, with or without bleeding, before embolization. Note the non-linear scale on the y-axis, which better highlights differences in the box plots compared to a linear scale.
- **Figure 2b**: Distribution of the proportion of the angiomyogenic component in the same tumors.

- **Figure 3a**: Number of angiomyolipomas, with or without bleeding before embolization, grouped by volume of the angiomyogenic component (in intervals of 10 cm³). Note that the intervals to the right of > 110 cm³ on the x-axis are not consistent in scale.
- **Figure 3b**: Number of angiomyolipomas, with or without bleeding before embolization, grouped by proportion of the angiomyogenic component (in intervals of 5%).

The median angiomyogenic component proportion was 10% (3–31), with bleeding tumors showing an increased median proportion.

### Treatment of renal angiomyolipoma: pooled analysis of individual patient data [^116zA3Ke]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Although several studies have shown excellent outcomes with different treatment modalities, the present results suggest suboptimal outcomes after AML embolisation. In the past, embolisation was the treatment of choice for AMLs, probably because analyses of different treatment modalities have shown that embolisation is effective for bleeding tumours. Preservation of the renal parenchyma, effective occlusion of bleeding vessels, and surgery prevention are considered the main benefits of embolisation.

However, in our study, the 3-year rate of freedom from re-intervention after embolisation was 63.5%, whereas it approached 100% for all other treatment modalities. Embolisation was performed in 128 tumours, 30.5% of which were asymptomatic and 25.0% of which were bleeding. Tumours treated by embolisation also had the largest mean diameter (9.1 ± 4.8 cm).

Remarkably, only the treatment modality was associated with a risk of re-intervention, consistent with the results of other series. We observed that the risk of re-intervention was lower if embolisation was performed for bleeding tumours with a diameter of 8 cm, likely because of their high vascularity, making embolisation of these large tumours more complex and less efficacious.

A 19-year-old patient with tuberous sclerosis presented with a renal angiomyolipoma. Because animal trials of tuberous sclerosis showed an effect of rapamycin on renal tumors, our patient was administered rapamycin for 6 months. During this time, the renal angiomyolipoma shrank significantly, regrew during an 8-month period, and decreased in size again after the readministration of rapamycin.

### Tumor-to-tumor metastasis: Report of 2 cases of metastatic carcinoma to angiomyolipoma of the kidney [^114TQHxU]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare phenomenon. Renal cell carcinoma is the most common recipient of tumor-to-tumor metastasis in malignant tumors. However, renal angiomyolipoma has not been reported to be a recipient. Here, we report two cases of tumor-to-tumor metastasis to renal angiomyolipoma. In one case, the donor tumor originated from neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas, and in the other case, the donor tumor was from adenocarcinoma of the lung. The donor tumors displayed morphologic features that did not easily fit into renal angiomyolipoma, and they also demonstrated patterns of immunoreactivity consistent with the primary tumors rather than with renal angiomyolipoma. To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of tumor-to-tumor metastasis to renal angiomyolipoma. An awareness of this phenomenon is important to avoid an incorrect diagnosis when encountering unusual morphologic features in renal angiomyolipoma.

### Enhancing disease awareness for tuberous sclerosis complex in patients with radiologic diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma: an observational study [^112kM3es]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a birth incidence of 1 in 6,000 and an estimated 1 million affected individuals worldwide. TSC is caused by an inactivating mutation in either the TSC-1 or the TSC-2 gene, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin. These proteins form a complex that activates the GTPase-activating protein Rheb to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The lack of mTOR inactivation leads to an increase in protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, differentiation, and growth, which may affect virtually every organ. Therefore, TSC is very variable in its clinical manifestations.

Formerly, TSC was defined by Vogt's triad of facial angiofibromas, mental retardation, and intractable epilepsy. Nowadays, the clinical diagnosis is usually confirmed by either a set of major and minor diagnostic criteria or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC-1 or TSC-2 by molecular genetic testing. Even though neurological (90%) and cutaneous (90%) manifestations, such as cortical tubers, epilepsy, giant cell astrocytoma, hydrocephalus, neurodevelopmental impairment, and facial angiofibromas, are the most common symptoms of TSC, 70 to 80% of TSC patients are also affected by renal angiomyolipoma (AML).

Histologically, these benign tumors are composed of blood vessels, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle. In contrast to sporadic AML, TSC-associated AML usually manifests in childhood and adolescence. Growing renal AMLs pose a significant cause of mortality in TSC patients, since they bear…

### Safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial embolization in renal angiomyolipomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129XYbR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Renal angiomyolipoma (AML), constituting the most prevalent benign renal tumor, accounts for 0.2–0.6% of all renal masses and displays a female predilection exceeding 2:1. While 80% of cases occur sporadically, the remaining 20% are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Typically, renal AMLs follow a benign course due to gradual growth with symptoms manifesting when the tumor size reaches 4 cm or greater. However, their association with TSC leads to rapid growth. AMLs are classically diagnosed by the presence of fat on ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can achieve 99% specificity, even in fat-poor AMLs. Currently, the European Association of Urology and Canadian Urological Association recommend that asymptomatic renal AMLs of 4 cm require treatment.

Traditionally, nephron-sparing surgery has seen great success in the management of AMLs. However, more minimally invasive approaches such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) techniques have emerged and seen success since 1986. TAE is a sophisticated and targeted approach that selectively occludes the feeding arteries of the tumor and induces a controlled ischemic environment within the AML while minimizing collateral damage to the surrounding healthy renal tissue. This nuanced technique showcases TAE as a valuable option for both acute scenarios involving hemorrhage and as a proactive measure to limit the vascular supply to renal AMLs.

### Renal angiomyolipoma: From imaging to intervention [^116m4m4F]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

A high volume of cross-sectional imaging has created a window of opportunity for radiologists to identify renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). The purpose of this review is to help the reader recognize the spectrum of renal AML appearances using different imaging methods and to gain an understanding of the classic and atypical features for appropriate lesion characterization. Risk factors for AML growth and rupture will be highlighted. An overview of the imaging features of acute AML rupture will be provided, principally relating to computed tomography (CT) assessment. A series of cases will be presented, including a case of peripartum renal AML rupture during Caesarean section, leading to a diagnostic dilemma.

- **Indications for intervention**: The indications for intervention and available treatment options will be considered, including medical therapy, surgery, and interventional radiology (IR) techniques along with their pros and cons.

- **Emergency interventional radiology management**: Emergency interventional radiology management with selective transarterial embolization will be presented and analyzed in relation to technique, angiographic appearances (pre and post-embolization), and associated complications.

### Management of renal angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex [^114zJGkH]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Intensive management is generally recommended for angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which are known to have a more aggressive nature than sporadic tumors. In this study, we evaluated the management of these tumors.

The records of 6 men and 6 women with TSC, and a mean age of 28.8 years, with angiomyolipomas treated from 1984 to 2000 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had bilateral multiple tumors with a mean size of 6.6 cm. There were 10 lesions classified as small (less than 4 cm), 6 medium (4 to 10 cm), and 8 large lesions (10 cm or greater). Computerized tomography was repeated annually for follow-up observation and semiannually after embolization.

Excluding from study 3 tumors treated prophylactically, intervention was required in 20%, 50%, and 100% of small, medium, and large tumors, respectively. Among 14 tumors followed by observation, 8 grew and 4 required intervention. Uncontrollable hemorrhage did not develop in any patient. While some tumors showed remarkable growth in decade 3, growth did not exceed 1.5 cm per year. Embolization was performed in 11 tumors and tumors shrank in 10. Although 1 patient experienced renal atrophy, all patients but 1 are alive without renal failure, with a mean follow-up of 60 months.

Although asymptomatic angiomyolipomas associated with TSC grow gradually, severe hemorrhage is rare and most tumors can be managed conservatively with annual computerized tomography. Embolization is the first choice of intervention but should be reserved until symptoms develop.

### Natural history of renal angiomyolipoma (AML): Most patients with large AMLs > 4 cm can be offered active surveillance as an initial management strategy [^115Ae27W]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The natural history of renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is unknown. Treatment recommendations are primarily derived from smaller case series, which often exhibit selection bias towards symptomatic patients.

- **Objective**: To define the natural history of renal AML, including growth rates, size, and clinical presentation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A unique radiology data-mining system (Montage; Montage Healthcare Systems, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was employed to retrospectively review the radiology database in an academic health center from 2002 to 2013 to identify all renal AMLs. Out of 2741 patients identified, 447 with 582 AMLs had three or more imaging studies suitable for analysis.

- **Intervention**: Angioembolisation, surgery, radiofrequency ablation, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: The primary endpoint was the growth rate of untreated AMLs. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine changes in growth rate over time. The association among growth rate, size, patient factors, and interventions was also evaluated.

- **Results and limitations**: The majority of untreated AMLs (> 92%) had not shown growth at a median follow-up of 43 months, with no significant difference in growth rates between AMLs ≤ 4 cm and > 4 cm. Most AMLs were found in female participants (80%) and were asymptomatic (91%). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was confirmed in 3.8% (n = 17) and presented at an earlier age with a median size of 5.5 cm (p < 0.001). Interventions were performed in 5.6% of patients. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

### Case report and literature review of complex renal angiomyolipoma [^113mYJgn]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare benign renal tumor with notable clinical implications, including potential compression of adjacent organs and a heightened risk of spontaneous hemorrhage, particularly when the tumor grows large. We present a complex case involving renal AML in a 52-year-old male patient who exhibited persistent left flank pain. Radiological imaging revealed a bilateral AML, with the most significant lesion on the left measuring approximately 13.5 × 19.3 × 15.6 cm. This lesion was associated with multiple renal stones, fluid accumulation, and atrophy of the left kidney. Surgical intervention was necessary, leading to open nephrectomy and removal of the left renal mass. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma and left renal atrophy. This case report provides critical insights into the multifaceted nature of renal AML, covering its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment, and thus enhances the understanding and management of this condition in clinical practice.

### Efficacy of prophylactic selective arterial embolization for renal angiomyolipomas: Identifying predictors of 50% volume reduction [^113op6K2]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is an uncommon benign tumor, representing 1–3% of all renal tumors (Fujii et al; Steiner et al; Nelson and Sanda; Harabayashi et al.). AMLs are classified broadly into two types: the sporadic type, constituting 80% of renal AMLs; and AMLs associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC), constituting 20% of all renal AMLs (Fujii et al; Steiner et al; Harabayashi et al.). AMLs are identifiable on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their fat content (Flum et al.). In symptomatic cases, the most common symptom is flank pain, followed by a palpable mass and hematuria (Nelson and Sanda). AMLs are also considered hypervascular tumors, with fine feeding arteries accompanied by microaneurysms. These tumors are thus at risk of intratumoral hemorrhage, rupture, and massive retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal hemorrhage, which can prove life-threatening (Nelson and Sanda; Harabayashi et al; Soulen et al.).

Radical and partial nephrectomy, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), and ablative therapies, including cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation, are considered treatment options (Flum et al.). Among them, TAE is widely performed for AMLs as the first choice for prophylaxis or emergency treatment for bleeding (Steiner et al; Van Baal et al; Kennelly et al.). Previous reports have generally suggested that prophylactic treatments such as TAE should be performed for asymptomatic AMLs ≥ 4 cm in diameter or AMLs with microaneurysms ≥ 5 mm in the feeding artery (Yamakado et al.).

### Renal angiomyolipoma-investigating radiological signs indicative of risk for bleeding [^111gTc1M]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

To compare imaging differences between bleeding and non-bleeding angiomyolipoma with respect to the proportion and attenuation of the angiomyogenic component and the occurrence and size of aneurysms, CT scans and angiographies preceding 58 consecutive embolisations at two institutions from 1999 to 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Tumor volume was measured by contouring the angiomyolipoma on CT scans. The partial volume of the angiomyogenic component (blood vessels and smooth muscle relative to fatty tissue) was derived using attenuation threshold values measured in Hounsfield Units.

Bleeding angiomyolipoma exhibited a significantly higher proportion of angiomyogenic component (23%) than non-bleeding angiomyolipoma (8%) (p = 0.042). Angiomyolipoma with 0–5% angiomyogenic component had a lower risk of bleeding compared to those with ≥ 5% angiomyogenic component (13% vs 42%). Mean attenuation values of angiomyogenic components did not differ between bleeders and non-bleeders. Aneurysms were observed in 24% of angiomyolipoma during angiography. No statistically significant association was found between the occurrence of aneurysms and bleeding, neither when all aneurysms were included nor when only aneurysms ≥ 5 mm were considered. Tuberous sclerosis patients had larger tumors (11.4 cm vs 6.0 cm), but no significant difference in bleeding was observed (p = 0.53).

A higher proportion of the angiomyogenic component in bleeding renal angiomyolipoma suggests a possible association with bleeding.

### Sporadic, classic-type renal angiomyolipoma with renal vein and inferior vena cava extension: An incidental case [^116zL7r4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) were first described in the early 1900s by Gravitz, but it was not until 1951 that they were named renal AML. These kidney tumors are rare, occurring in 0.13%-0.44% of the population. These mesenchymal tumors are composed of smooth muscle-like, adipocyte-like, and epithelioid cells. Depending on the predominant cell population, they can be further subclassified into classic, epithelioid, and AML with epithelial cyst.

A 32-year-old woman presented with mild, intermittent, epigastric, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an incidental lesion within the inferior vena cava (IVC). A CT scan showed a lesion within the left renal vein extending into the IVC with 40% narrowing and a fat-containing mass in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 15mm, suggesting an AML. Thrombectomy was performed, and the specimen was positive for classic variant renal AML.

Initial diagnosis is centered on imaging studies, based on fatty tissue concentration. The AML expresses melanocytic markers, which helps differentiate it from renal cell carcinoma. Although AML is considered a benign condition, there is evidence of malignant transformation. Active surveillance is recommended for lesions less than 4cm. Nephron-sparing surgery is the procedure of choice. Nephrectomy is recommended if there is a high probability of malignancy. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been proposed as an alternative treatment.

### Whole exome sequencing identifies TSC1/TSC2 biallelic loss as the primary and sufficient driver event for renal angiomyolipoma development [^113652Hq]. PLoS Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipoma is a pathologically benign mesenchymal kidney tumor characterized by vascular, smooth muscle, and adipocyte elements. Angiomyolipomas are rare in the general population, with an autopsy prevalence of about 1 in 1,000, but are seen in more than 70% of adults with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) (MIM: 191100, 613254) where they are usually multifocal and bilateral. TSC is a genetic disorder characterized by seizures, tumor development in the brain, heart, kidney, and skin, and a distinctive set of neurodevelopmental syndromes known as TSC-associated neurologic disorder (TAND). TSC arises due to inactivating heterozygous or mosaic mutations in either TSC1 (approximately 21%) or TSC2 (approximately 79%).

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a pathologic condition related to angiomyolipoma, in which similar cellular proliferation occurs in the lung in the form of small (< 5 mm) nodules, causing progressive cystic lung disease that can be fatal. LAM occurs almost exclusively in women and is seen at a much higher frequency in those with TSC compared to the general population, with up to 80% of women with TSC having evidence of cystic lung disease. Both angiomyolipoma and LAM belong to the family of Perivascular Epithelioid Cell tumors (PEComa).

Previous genetic studies have shown that angiomyolipomas arising in TSC patients occur due to biallelic inactivation of either TSC2 or TSC1. The first mutational event ("hit") in TSC2 or TSC1 is the germline mutation that causes TSC in the individual. The genetic "second hit" event leads to the hyperactivation of mTORC1 (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1) and co…

### Afinitor disperz [^111BPMa9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of AFINITOR was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received AFINITOR 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation.

The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by the use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.

### Benign renal angiomyolipoma with inferior vena cava thrombosis [^112bi6Vx]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To present a new case of an uncommon complication of a benign renal tumor, we explore the presentation of benign renal angiomyolipoma (AML) with tumor thrombus in females. Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is a recently described rare variant of renal angiomyolipoma. It can occur in patients with or without tuberous sclerosis and may potentially be malignant. Benign renal angiomyolipoma rarely presents with evidence of extension into the renal vein, inferior vena cava (IVC), or atrium. We report a case of benign renal AML with a tumor thrombus to the IVC in a 46-year-old female who presented with right-sided flank pain associated with a right-sided abdominal mass.

- **Methods**: Right radical nephrectomy with IVC tumor thrombectomy.

- **Results**: The patient is totally asymptomatic. At 1 month after surgery, an abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of thrombus within the IVC. A CT scan of the abdomen at 3 months post-operatively showed no evidence of recurrence.

Surgical treatment of angiomyolipoma with IVC thrombus is warranted due to the risk of malignancy and to prevent tumor embolus to the heart or lungs.

### Fat poor renal angiomyolipoma: Patient, computerized tomography and histological findings [^113vf6xK]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed our experience with fat poor cases of angiomyolipoma. The records of patients with angiomyolipoma, as determined by pathological study from 1998 to 2004, were reviewed by recording patient demographics and outcomes. Fat poor cases were defined as the failure of imaging to demonstrate fat in a lesion. Computerized tomography and histological characteristics were assessed.

Histologically confirmed angiomyolipoma was found in 15 patients. Multiple lesions were found in 3 of the 15 cases (20%). Of these 15 patients who underwent surgery, 11 (73%) had unsuspected angiomyolipoma due to absent fat on computerized tomography, and they underwent intervention for presumed renal cell carcinoma. The mean age ± SD in this group was 54 ± 15 years. Additionally, 8 of the 11 patients (73%) were female, of whom 4 (50%) had uterine fibroids. These lesions were found incidentally in 7 of the 11 cases (64%). Operative complications developed in 2 of the 11 patients (18%). The average maximal diameter on pathological evaluation was 3.2 ± 1.3 cm (range 1.5 to 6). Nonenhanced computerized tomography was available in 7 of the 11 cases, of which 3 of 7 (42%) showed hyperdense lesions and 4 of 7 (57%) showed isodense lesions. The percent of fat identified per high power field was less than 25% in 12 of 13 fat poor angiomyolipoma lesions (92%) compared to 2 of 4 classic lesions (50%) known to be angiomyolipoma before surgery (p = 0.04).

We suggest that a general definition of fat poor angiomyolipoma should be the failure of imaging to reveal fat within a lesion.

### Treatment of renal angiomyolipoma: pooled analysis of individual patient data [^114G9yev]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are frequent benign renal tumors composed of fat cells, smooth muscle cells, and blood vessels. These tumors belong to a family of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors. AMLs occur sporadically in 80% of cases, while the remaining cases are associated with various genetic disorders. The incidence of AMLs in the general population is 0.4%. However, this tumor has been reported in 5.7% to 6.9% of partially resected, preoperatively presumed cases of renal carcinoma. The most severe complication related to renal AML is retroperitoneal bleeding, reported in 15% of patients and potentially leading to shock in 20% to 30% of these patients.

According to the Guidelines of the European Association of Urology, the primary indications for treatment of renal AML are the presence of symptoms or suspected malignancy. Biopsy may guide treatment decisions for lesions with unusual growth and imaging characteristics. The Level C recommendations for prophylactic intervention include large AMLs, women of childbearing age, and patients for whom follow-up or access to emergency care may be inadequate. The treatment threshold for AML tumors with a diameter of ≥ 4 cm has recently been disputed. A recent study showed that treating all AMLs of > 4 cm might lead to an over-treatment rate of 65%. Additionally, the optimal treatment method for bleeding tumors has not yet been defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of baseline characteristics, particularly tumor diameter, and treatment methods on the outcome of patients with AML.

The higher proportion of the angiomyogenic component in bleeding angiomyolipoma suggests a potential link to haemorrhage and could be an important factor to consider when deciding on intervention, particularly as the emphasis on absolute size is being re-evaluated. Angiomyolipoma with a very low angiomyogenic component may represent a clinically relevant subgroup with a lower risk of spontaneous bleeding.

Our findings do not confirm the widely accepted notion that aneurysms, especially those 5 mm or larger, significantly increase bleeding risk.

### Torpenz [^115Lc6pi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets, 10 mg, or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation.

The major efficacy outcome measure was the angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review. This was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted six months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.

### Enhancing disease awareness for tuberous sclerosis complex in patients with radiologic diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma: an observational study [^115mDZcP]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The TSC+ patient within the age range of 40–45 years showed multiple bilateral AML. In the age range of 18–40 years, 4 (66.7%) and 2 (33.3%) of the 6 patients presented with bilateral and unilateral renal AML, respectively (p < 0.05). TSC+ patients with bilateral renal AML all had multiple AML lesions, whereas all TSC+ patients with unilateral AML had only a single lesion.

In AML+/TSC− patients, unilateral and bilateral AML was found in 83.9% (26/31) and 16.1% (5/31; p < 0.05), respectively. Among the TSC− group, unilateral AML presented predominantly (92.3%; 24/26) and bilateral AML uniquely (100%; 5/5) as a single lesion.

- **Prevalence of angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex in the age group 18 to 40 years**: AML+, angiomyolipoma positive; TSC+/−, tuberous sclerosis complex positive/negative.

The presence of renal AML, either uni- or bilateral, significantly correlated with a TSC diagnosis (p = 0.028). Simple binary logistic regression analysis revealed bilateral AML (OR 33.0; 95% CI 3.2–344.0; p = 0.003), but not unilateral AML (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.88; p = 0.04), to be a risk factor for the presence of TSC.

**Conclusions**: The presence of renal AML in patients aged 18–40 years should raise suspicion for TSC as the underlying cause. Therefore, patients with bilateral renal AML should be referred for further testing for TSC, especially in light of recent changes in the management of TSC and the option of disease-targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors.

### Angiomyolipoma in the lung detected 15 years following a nephrectomy for renal angiomyolipoma [^113xzGTK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Angiomyolipoma is generally found in the kidney but is especially rare in the lung. Nine cases of angiomyolipoma in the lung have been reported previously, and in three of these patients, it was involved with nephrectomy for renal angiomyolipoma. The origination of the tumor was not completely recognized, but lymphangioleiomyomatosis and angiomyolipoma are known to have a common feature. The pathogenesis of angiomyolipoma in the lung has recently been researched in relation to lymphangioleiomyomatosis. We review these case reports of angiomyolipoma in the lung and discuss the clinical features and the generation of these tumors.

### The radiological diagnosis and treatment of renal angiomyolipoma-current status [^116bFwrS]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are the most common benign renal neoplasm and are often discovered incidentally. Due to both an increase in the use of imaging and advances in imaging technology, they are increasingly identified in the general population. As these lesions are benign, there is good evidence that the majority can be safely followed up without treatment. However, there is a growing body of information suggesting that prophylactic treatment is indicated for individuals with AMLs to prevent complications such as hemorrhage.

Treatment with radiological interventional techniques, such as subselective particle embolization, has replaced surgical techniques in most cases. Even in emergencies with catastrophic rupture, prompt embolization may save the patient, with the added benefit of renal salvage. Confident identification of a lesion as an AML is important, as its benign nature usually obviates the need for surgery. The presence of fat is crucial in confirming and characterizing these lesions.

Although fat-rich AMLs are easy to diagnose, some lesions are fat-poor, and in these cases, newer imaging techniques, such as in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may aid in confidently diagnosing AML. This paper comprehensively reviews the imaging techniques used to diagnose AML, including the features of both characteristic and atypical lesions. Additionally, we discuss guidelines for follow-up and prophylactic treatment.

### Renal angiomyolipomata [^113FX33i]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomata can exist as an imaging curiosity or represent a life-threatening condition. There are likely over 10 million people worldwide who have a renal angiomyolipomata, and approximately one-tenth of these people also have tuberous sclerosis complex. The optimum treatment of angiomyolipomata focuses on sparing renal tissue and has included no intervention, both total and partial nephrectomy, and embolization. As basic science investigation into the biology of angiomyolipomata progresses, there is hope for successful drug therapy. Because these renal lesions can be associated with other organ system dysfunctions, a number of medical specialists become involved in the care of affected patients. The purpose of this article is to update the nephrologist on the molecular understanding of renal angiomyolipomata and explore the possibilities of pharmacologic therapy in the future.

### Case report and literature review of complex renal angiomyolipoma [^1173LzH6]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Pathology is the best way to diagnose renal angiomyolipoma (AML), which must be distinguished from liposarcoma and fatty renal cell carcinoma. The pathogenic features of AML are as follows. Grossly, the tumor has definite demarcations, no outer covering, and may exhibit gray‒red, gray‒white, or gray‒yellow parts that are intermixed and hemorrhagic. Microscopically, the tumor displays thick-walled blood vessels, smooth muscle bundles, and fully developed fat cells. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed varied expression of melanocyte and leiomyoma markers, and potential positivity for S-100. Epithelial cell markers are always negative. The most reliable immunohistochemical evidence for diagnosing AML is the presence of HMB45 and/or Melan-A and SMA, which indicate certain clinical traits. Pathology revealed irregular grayish-yellow adipose tissue in the tumor. Microscopic examination showed robust blood vessels, smooth muscle bundles, and fully developed adipose tissue. Positive staining for HMB45, S-100, and Ki-67 confirmed renal AML via immunohistochemistry.

Current primary therapy options for renal AML include conservative treatment, interventional treatment, surgical treatment, and others. Regardless of the chosen treatment approach, it is crucial to prioritize the preservation of healthy kidney tissue, especially for patients at risk of renal insufficiency.

In conclusion, AML is a rare benign renal tumor that often presents with atypical clinical symptoms. Diagnosis typically relies on imaging techniques.

### Pediatric renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis complex [^114DRBz1]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of hamartomas in multiple organs. Up to 80% of patients with this condition will have at least one angiomyolipoma in their lifetime. This study describes the incidence and natural history of angiomyolipoma in a pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex population. It also analyzes tumor growth to determine optimal renal imaging intervals, aiming to improve counseling, treatment, and follow-up.

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex from 2004 to 2014. Patients were included if they had a clinical or genetic diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and had undergone at least one renal imaging study.

A total of 145 patients were analyzed, with a median age of 14 years (range 0 to 28). The overall incidence of angiomyolipoma was 50.3%. The median age at first angiomyolipoma detection was 11 years (range 2 to 26). The median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by age at first detection was 0.0 mm for patients 0 to 6 years old, 0.9 mm for those 7 to 11 years old, 2.5 mm for those 12 to 16 years old, and 1.8 mm for those 17 years old or older. The median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by tumor size at first detection was 0.1 mm for tumors 0.6 to 0.9 cm, 1.8 mm for those 1.0 to 1.9 cm, and 4.3 mm for those 2.0 to 2.9 cm. A total of 35 patients (24.1%) received mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors. Eight patients underwent a total of 13 surgical interventions, of whom two had previously been treated with mTOR inhibitors.

### Evidence of renal angiomyolipoma neoplastic stem cells arising from renal epithelial cells [^111ZLBjk]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TSC2, and more rarely in TSC1, appear to represent the key genetic driving events of renal AMLs. We show that loss of function of TSC2 in genetic backgrounds that abrogate senescence and proliferation arrest is sufficient to convert mouse and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells into neoplastic stem cells. These cells give rise to allograft or xenograft tumors that reproduce many of the histological and molecular features of human renal AMLs, providing the first models of AML-like tumors.

It should be noted that these tumors represent "models", as the genetic backgrounds we employed in this study to overcome cellular senescence induced by loss of TSC2 function are not reflected in the genetics of human renal AMLs. For example, genetic mutations or deletions of TP53, CDKN2A, or other senescence-regulating tumor suppressor genes have not been observed in AML tumors. It remains possible that yet-to-be-identified mechanisms operating at the epigenetic, translational, or protein levels may permit escape from senescence in human renal AML.

In addition, our engineered, subcutaneously growing tumors do not fully reproduce all of the morphological features and growth patterns seen in human renal AMLs growing in the kidney. Nonetheless, our studies of our engineered model systems revealed some new features of human renal AMLs, supporting the relevance of our models. Our engineered cells exhibit a proximal tubule gene expression signature, express proximal tubule-specific proteins, and display upregulation of several specific markers.

### Computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings of fat-poor angiomyolipomas [^113QFStP]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 5% of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are classified as "fat poor" due to the lack of visually detectable fat on imaging, making them difficult to distinguish from renal cell carcinoma. Recent investigations have proposed CT and MR imaging features suggestive of fat-poor AML (fp-AML). Herein, we determined the frequency of these features in a cohort of fp-AMLs by retrospective review of preoperative imaging.

- **Methods**: A pathology database query from January 2005 to August 2013 identified 49 renal specimens of AML with available imaging. A retrospective review of all CT and MR images of these 49 cases was conducted. Cases with visually detectable fat on imaging were excluded.

- **Results**: A total of 26 fp-AMLs were identified. Thirteen lesions had available unenhanced CT images, of which eight (62%) were hyperdense compared to the adjacent renal parenchyma, while five (38%) were isodense. Twenty lesions had enhanced CT images: 14 (70%) with homogeneous enhancement and 6 (30%) with heterogeneous enhancement. Of the nine lesions with enhanced MR sequences, five (56%) were homogeneously enhancing, and four (44%) were heterogeneously enhancing. Eight of nine (89%) lesions had hypointense signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted MR sequences, while one (11%) had hyperintense SI. None of the eight lesions displayed a decrease in signal on fat-suppressed sequences.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we confirmed common imaging features of fp-AML: high attenuation on unenhanced CT sequences, homogeneous enhancement on CT, and hypointensity on T2-weighted MR.

### Efficacy of prophylactic selective arterial embolization for renal angiomyolipomas: Identifying predictors of 50% volume reduction [^113jMStQ]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old man with a sporadic AML was examined. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an exophytic, well-enhanced, right renal AML, 64 mm in diameter (Fig. 1a). Right renal angiography before embolization revealed tumor staining and tortuous feeding arteries with a microaneurysm (Fig. 1b). Following embolization with microspheres, absolute ethanol, and microcoils, both the tumor stain and feeding arteries disappeared (Fig. 1c). Two years post-TAE, contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated marked shrinkage of the embolized tumor with necrotic changes (Fig. 1d).

A 34-year-old woman with a TSC-AML was studied. Contrast-enhanced CT displayed multiple left renal AMLs. The tumor located in the ventral lateral position in the left kidney contained a microaneurysm, 11 mm in diameter (white arrows in Fig. 2a). Left renal angiography before embolization showed tumor stain and several microaneurysms (white arrows), with the normal left renal parenchyma compressed by the embolized tumor (Fig. 2b). Post-embolization, the tumor stain and microaneurysms disappeared, retaining normal renal parenchyma and revealing residual untreated tumor (white arrows in Fig. 2c). Two years post-TAE, contrast-enhanced CT indicated a reduction in tumor volume with no residual aneurysm (Fig. 2d).

- **Technical success and complications**: Technical success was defined as the achievement of disappearance of tumor stain and microaneurysms with stasis of the feeding artery. Complications related to TAE were classified according to the criteria of the Society of Interventional Radiology as major or minor.

### Renal angiomyolipoma: Mid- to long-term results following embolization with Onyx [^111mAuna]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Percutaneous transcatheter embolization is currently the preferred treatment for ruptured or enlarging renal angiomyolipoma (AML), although the optimum choice of embolic material has not yet been established. We present mid- to long-term outcomes following embolization of AMLs with Onyx.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten AMLs in seven patients (including two with tuberous sclerosis) were embolized with Onyx. Patients were followed up clinically, with tumor size and renal function measured pre- and post-procedure.

- **Results**: Mean pre-treatment AML size was 63.4 mm (range 42–100). Mean clinical follow-up was 431.4 days (range 153–986), and imaging follow-up was 284.2 days (range 30–741). There was no hemorrhage from treated lesions within the follow-up period. Of patients who had cross-sectional imaging pre- and post-procedure, a mean decrease in AML size of 22 mm was seen after Onyx embolization (p = 0.0058, 95% CI 9.13–34.87). No significant difference between serum creatinine was seen pre- and post-procedure (p = 0.54, 95% CI 8.63–4.85).

- **Conclusions**: Onyx embolization of renal AMLs is effective in the medium to long term, with theoretical benefits in safety and durability of result.

### The efficacy, safety, and durability of selective renal arterial embolization in treating symptomatic and asymptomatic renal angiomyolipoma [^111qr5kP]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To review the long-term outcome of selective renal arterial embolization (SAE) in treating renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) in both elective and emergency settings, 27 patients (28 renal units) were treated with SAE between October 1988 and September 2008. Treatment was administered on an emergency basis for 15 (53.6%) bleeding AMLs and prophylactically for 13 (46.4%) asymptomatic high-risk (size > 4.1 cm) AMLs. The cohort included six males and 21 females with a mean age of 46.3 years (range, 26–68). Patients were followed for a mean period of 7.1 years (range, 1.3–20.2) to observe recurrence of symptoms, need for re-embolization, or need for renal surgery. SAE outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and predictors of outcomes were identified with univariate analysis by log-rank test.

The mean size of AMLs was 10.9 cm (range, 4–30). Eight (29.6%) patients had bilateral, and 19 (70.4%) had unilateral AMLs. Seventeen (60.7%) kidneys had solitary AMLs, while 11 (39.2%) kidneys had multicentric AMLs. Of the 15 bleeding AMLs, 12 (80%) patients required a blood transfusion. Twenty-six (93%) AMLs were successfully embolized in the first SAE. During follow-up, four (14.8%) patients required re-embolization, and renal surgery was necessary for four (14.8%) patients. From the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the overall renal surgery sparing rate at 5 years was 85% (95% CI: 71–99%), and the single session SAE success rate at 5 years was 63% (95% CI: 42–84%). Of all the variables, only AML > 10 cm was significantly associated with the subsequent need for renal surgery (P = .03). No renal malignancy was noted at follow-up.

### Renal functional outcomes in patients with angiomyolipomas: Surveillance vs embolization vs nephrectomy [^112NmbLF]. Urology (2023). High credibility.

To investigate renal functional outcomes of surveillance, embolization, and surgery for angiomyolipomas (AML), longitudinal data regarding patients with AML were analyzed retrospectively in this two-center study. Demographic, radiographic, and functional data were tabulated according to treatment type. The primary outcome was the change in renal function from diagnosis to within six months post-diagnosis (interim) and to the latest glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessment.

A total of 318 patients were diagnosed with AMLs, with a mean follow-up of 6.2 years. Of these, 184 patients (57.9%) were managed with surveillance, 30 (9.4%) underwent embolization, and 103 (32.4%) underwent surgery (91 partial nephrectomy; 12 radical nephrectomy). Baseline characteristics, including tumor size, age, and race, differed between the three groups (p < 0.05). Surveilled AMLs were smaller (p < 0.001) than those in the intervention groups: 1.9 cm compared to 5.4 cm for embolization and 4.9 cm for surgery.

Greater interim decreases in GFR were observed following intervention with embolization (-14.0%) or surgery (-11.8%) compared to surveillance (-4.1%); however, this was not statistically significant (P = .19). The latest GFR was also reduced more (P = .02) with embolization (-14.1%) and surgery (-14.7%) compared to surveillance (-6.0%). At the latest determination, chronic kidney disease progression by at least one stage occurred in 37.8% overall, including 33.7% of surveilled patients, and was not statistically different across the three cohorts (P = .074).

### Clinical correlates of renal angiomyolipoma subtypes in 209 patients: Classic, fat poor, tuberous sclerosis associated and epithelioid [^112fRDKN]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Angiomyolipomas classically present radiographically as fat-containing lesions, but some fail to demonstrate fat content. Histologically confirmed angiomyolipomas uniformly follow a benign course, but rare epithelioid variants of angiomyolipoma can recur and metastasize. We investigated the clinical, radiographic, and histological characteristics of each angiomyolipoma subtype.

Pertinent data were recorded for 209 patients surgically treated for angiomyolipoma in 219 kidneys from 1981 to 2007. Classic and fat poor angiomyolipomas were classified radiographically based on the presence or absence of fat and classified histologically based on the presence of triphasic, monophasic, or epithelioid histology.

- **Results**:
	- Median radiographic size was 3.2, 4.9, and 10 cm in patients with a single angiomyolipoma (59% of patients), multiple angiomyolipomas, and tuberous sclerosis (probable or definite), respectively. In these three groups, 65%, 47%, and 33% of lesions were not suspected radiographically (fat poor angiomyolipoma).
	- Fat poor angiomyolipomas were more commonly single, smaller, and found in older patients. Triphasic histology was evident in 76% of angiomyolipomas, with 16% demonstrating a predominance of one component, and 8% containing epithelioid features. Despite potentially aggressive findings in 18% (e.g. presence within the perinephric fat, lymph node involvement), no angiomyolipoma recurred during a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (range 0 to 24).
	- A total of 28 (13%) patients with angiomyolipoma had concomitant renal cell carcinoma.

### Renal angiomyolipoma-investigating radiological signs indicative of risk for bleeding [^112VGkFW]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

To compare imaging differences between bleeding and non-bleeding angiomyolipoma with respect to the proportion and attenuation of the angiomyogenic component and the occurrence and size of aneurysms, CT scans and angiographies preceding 58 consecutive embolizations at two institutions from 1999 to 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Tumor volume was measured by contouring the angiomyolipoma on CT scans. The partial volume of the angiomyogenic component (blood vessels and smooth muscle relative to fatty tissue) was derived using attenuation threshold values measured in Hounsfield Units.

Bleeding angiomyolipoma exhibited a significantly higher proportion of angiomyogenic component (23%) than non-bleeding angiomyolipoma (8%) (p = 0.042). Angiomyolipoma with 0–5% angiomyogenic component had a lower risk of bleeding compared to those with ≥ 5% angiomyogenic component (13% vs 42%). Mean attenuation values of angiomyogenic components did not differ between bleeders and non-bleeders. Aneurysms were observed in 24% of angiomyolipoma during angiography. No statistically significant association was found between the occurrence of aneurysms and bleeding, neither when all aneurysms were included nor when only aneurysms ≥ 5mm were considered. Tuberous sclerosis patients had larger tumors (11.4 cm vs 6.0 cm), but no significant difference in bleeding was observed (p = 0.53).

A higher proportion of the angiomyogenic component in bleeding renal angiomyolipoma suggests a possible association with bleeding. Angiomyolipoma with less than 5% angiomyogenic component had a lower risk of bleeding.

Angiomyolipomas are the most common mesenchymal renal neoplasms. Two types have been described: (i) sporadic angiomyolipoma, and (ii) angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis. Giant aneurysm formation is usually noted in angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis and is rare in the sporadic variety. Tumor diameter and aneurysm diameter have been used as predictors of rupture. We report a rare case of aneurysm formation in a sporadic angiomyolipoma.

### Is the follow-up of small renal angiomyolipomas a necessary precaution [^111u82dt]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

To investigate the natural history and rationalize follow-up of renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), a prospectively gathered radiology database was scrutinized. This was done to identify patients with renal AMLs over a 3-year period (January 2006 to December 2008). Radiological investigations were examined to identify those AMLs exhibiting change during surveillance.

A total of 135 patients were identified. The mean age at first detection was 49.6 years, and patients were followed up for a median of 21.8 months (ranging from 6 to 85.3 months). Small AMLs (≤ 20 mm) were less likely to grow than their larger counterparts, with an odds ratio of 13.3, a confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.4–123.9, and a p-value of 0.02. These small AMLs exhibited a slower growth rate of 0.7 mm/year compared to 9.2 mm/year for larger lesions. Patients with AMLs that increased in size were significantly younger, with a median age of 43 versus 52 years (p < 0.001). Multiple AMLs or those associated with genetic conditions grew at a significantly greater rate of 3 mm/year compared to 0.1 mm/year (p < 0.001). AMLs with a large extra-renal component are less reliably measured on ultrasound, with a median error of 7 mm compared to 1 mm (p < 0.001).

This study is the first with the primary purpose of investigating the growth of small AMLs (≤ 20 mm). Small, solitary AMLs (≤ 20 mm) do not require follow-up due to their low probability of growth. Patients with multiple AMLs and younger patients require closer monitoring due to their comparatively greater AML growth rate. Ultrasound-detected AMLs with an extra-renal component may require computed tomography (CT) to confirm their size.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex presenting as bilateral large renal angiomyolipomas [^113JgqnV]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis is an inherited disorder that can present with seizures, mental retardation, cutaneous lesions, and visceral hamartomas, but can be entirely asymptomatic. The disease occurs in 1 in 100,000 persons across all races with nearly equal distribution between the sexes. Tuberous sclerosis is often associated with renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), which occur in up to 80% of these patients. Here, we report a case of a patient who presented with bilateral large renal AMLs and was detected to have tuberous sclerosis complex.

### Evidence of renal angiomyolipoma neoplastic stem cells arising from renal epithelial cells [^113hDHrL]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

An interesting unanswered question is why mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 in humans predominantly causes the development of renal AMLs, renal cysts, and more rarely renal carcinomas, whereas Tsc1 or Tsc2 mutation in rats or mice causes renal cysts, adenomas, and carcinomas, but does not lead to the formation of renal AMLs. It is possible that the strong phenotypic effect of Tsc1 or Tsc2 deletion, causing epithelial hyperproliferation in the mouse kidney, means that AMLs do not have the necessary time to develop in mouse models. Alternatively, we speculate that our cell culture setting in some way reproduces specific microenvironmental conditions, or niches, that are abundant in human kidneys but rare in mouse kidneys in vivo. These specific conditions may be necessary for the formation of AMLs.

One possibility could be the apparent enhanced rate of loss and replacement of renal epithelial cells in human nephrons compared to mouse nephrons. This is believed to underlie the apparent 'spontaneous' epithelial to mesenchymal transition and acquisition of features of stemness in normal human kidneys but not in rodent kidneys. Finally, it is possible that AML development requires additional, yet-to-be-identified genetic or epigenetic alterations that cooperate with the loss of TSC function to promote the transition of an epithelial cell to an AML stem cell.

Renal AML belongs to a broader class of tumors termed PEComas, named after the common presence of perivascular epithelioid cells (PEC). PEComas also include AMLs that form in other organs, lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the…

### Pelvic angiomyolipoma [^111zhmrp]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Angiomyolipoma is a rare benign tumor most commonly found in the kidney and, infrequently, extrarenally. We report a case of pelvic angiomyolipoma in a male patient without stigmata of tuberous sclerosis. The patient presented with right retroperitoneal bleeding and was found to have bilateral renal angiomyolipomas as well as a pelvic mass with a similar appearance to the other lesions. He underwent urgent embolization of the large right angiomyolipoma and subsequent robot-assisted left laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with simultaneous resection of the pelvic mass, which was well-tolerated. Pathology confirmed what is, to our knowledge, the only reported case of pelvic angiomyolipoma.

### Embolization of giant renal angiomyolipomas: Technique and results [^112ZLHLC]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic embolization of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) larger than 10 cm, we conducted the following study:

- **Materials and methods**: Sixteen patients (mean age, 41.2 years; 14 women and two men) underwent embolization for 23 AMLs larger than 10 cm. All lesions were embolized using microcatheters with ethanol and ethiodized oil mixed in a ratio of 7 (ethanol) to 3 (ethiodized oil). Data collected included pre- and post-treatment AML size, creatinine level, technical success, volume of embolic material used, clinical success, and complications.

- **Results**: The mean AML size before treatment was 15 cm (range, 10–25 cm). Ten of the 16 patients (62%) had all their AMLs treated in one session, whereas six (38%) required multiple sessions. A mean volume of 8.6 mL of the ethanol-ethiodized oil mixture (range, 2–20 mL) was administered per lesion. Patients were followed up for a mean of 29 months (range, 1–80 months). No patient had an increase of 0.2 mg/dL (17.7 μmol/L) or greater in mean serum creatinine level during the follow-up period. Two of the 16 patients (12%) required repeat embolization due to AML regrowth (n = 1) or reperfusion (n = 1) observed at surveillance imaging. One of the 16 patients (6.2%) experienced an AML hemorrhage 59 months after embolization.

- **Conclusions**: Embolization of giant renal AMLs to decrease the risk of bleeding can be done safely without loss of renal function. Although recurrence was infrequent, additional treatment may be necessary, and giant renal AMLs should be followed up with serial imaging studies.
