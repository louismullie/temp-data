## Question

Diaper dermatitis treatment pediatric

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat and manage pediatric diaper dermatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing irritant contact dermatitis from candidiasis and other mimics. Then, I should verify severity and decide whether to escalate beyond basic care. Next, I will outline universal prevention and barrier strategies. After that, I will specify treatments by severity, including when to add low-potency steroids and antifungals. I should also review special populations and red flags, and finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and counseling points with safety checks and follow-up plans [^116zAFEX] [^1115YjRe].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because "diaper dermatitis" is a descriptive umbrella that includes irritant contact dermatitis, candidal infection, and other entities like seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and allergic contact dermatitis; I need to check the distribution and morphology carefully, since irritant dermatitis typically spares the deep folds and candidiasis involves the folds with beefy-red erythema and satellite pustules, and a KOH prep can rapidly distinguish candida when suspected [^116zAFEX] [^1168cD8Y] [^115zKRec].

> Wait, let me verify severity before I choose therapy, because management hinges on whether the eruption is mild, moderate, or severe; mild disease is usually erythema without erosions, moderate adds papules or superficial erosions, and severe shows extensive erosions, ulceration, or marked pain, and I should also ask about duration, prior antibiotics, and recent antifungal exposure to gauge risk for candidal superinfection and treatment resistance [^116zAFEX].

> Next, I should review universal prevention and barrier care, since most cases improve with these measures alone; I need to ensure frequent diaper changes, gentle cleansing with water or mild wipes, thorough drying by patting or air exposure, and liberal application of a thick barrier such as zinc oxide or petrolatum at every change, while avoiding fragranced wipes, soaps, and vigorous rubbing that can damage the barrier and raise pH, and I should confirm that caregivers understand that barrier creams complement but do not replace frequent diaper changes [^117G83X7] [^116a4e6i] [^116FSALk] [^113sbrwj].

> Hold on, I should verify diaper choices too; superabsorbent, breathable disposable diapers reduce moisture and enzymatic irritation and are preferred over cloth when DD is problematic, and if a persistent rash suggests allergic contact dermatitis, I need to consider dyes or other diaper components and trial a dye-free brand, as case series support dye-related ACD in select infants [^115UCxqG] [^112B5DQZ] [^111tqEZd].

> For mild irritant diaper dermatitis, I will now examine whether escalation is needed; most cases resolve with barrier strategies alone, and I should double-check that we are applying a thick layer of zinc oxide or petrolatum at every change and maximizing diaper-free time, with expected improvement in 2–4 days if the diagnosis and care are correct [^112wz9va] [^116FSALk].

> For moderate disease, let me consider adding a low-potency topical corticosteroid, but wait, I need to ensure I choose the right strength and avoid occlusion; hydrocortisone 1% ointment applied thinly twice daily for up to 7 days is reasonable, and I should stop when control is achieved, avoid tight diapers or plastic pants that act as occlusion, and reassess at 48–72 hours to confirm trajectory, because diapers can function as occlusive dressings and increase systemic absorption risk in infants [^116zAFEX] [^111Zcv8B] [^1115YjRe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost recommended a medium-potency steroid out of habit; hold on, I should verify labeling and safety — multiple FDA labels explicitly advise against medium- or high-potency steroids in the diaper area due to HPA axis suppression risk, so I must not use agents like mometasone, desonide, hydrocortisone butyrate, fluticasone, or betamethasone in this setting unless a specialist directs otherwise, and I should document rationale if any exception is contemplated [^113WtMBs] [^112GfuKf] [^114zX9sc] [^116mXYg8] [^111YxnW1].

> For severe disease with erosions or marked inflammation, I should confirm whether candidal involvement is likely and, if so, obtain a KOH prep; if candida is present, I need to treat with an antifungal such as miconazole nitrate 0.25% in zinc oxide/petrolatum base or nystatin, and I should remember that VUSION (miconazole 0.25% with zinc oxide and petrolatum) is FDA-indicated only for diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis in immunocompetent infants 4 weeks and older, used adjunctively with frequent diaper changes and gentle cleansing, and not for prophylaxis or for more than 7 days without reassessment [^113sbrwj] [^117Sx7aY] [^115TzYZx].

> Let me reconsider the role of combination steroid–antifungal products; I should avoid clotrimazole–betamethasone or similar combinations in the diaper area because of documented pediatric HPA axis suppression and the risk of masking infection, and if I mistakenly started one, I need to stop it promptly and switch to a pure antifungal with barrier care and, if absolutely necessary, a separate low-potency steroid for a very short course under close supervision [^117EkQgR] [^1121nvZS] [^11468Y76] [^113f4CGC].

> I should double-check for bacterial superinfection when there is malodor, purulence, or crusting; in that case, topical mupirocin or another appropriate topical antibiotic can be added to barrier and antifungal therapy as indicated, and I need to ensure we are not substituting topical medications for the fundamentals of frequent diaper changes and skin protection [^notfound].

> For special populations, let me verify nuances; in infants under 4 weeks, I should avoid VUSION and prioritize conservative measures, in exclusively breastfed infants I should anticipate higher stool frequency and consider more frequent changes and barrier use, in immunocompromised children I need a lower threshold to evaluate for systemic infection and consider broader antifungal coverage, and in persistent or atypical rashes I should broaden the differential to include nutritional deficiencies, psoriasis, LCH, and allergic contact dermatitis, with biopsy or targeted testing when indicated [^113sbrwj] [^113PWz2S] [^117M2cwy] [^115zKRec].

> But wait, what if the "diaper rash" is actually a clue to a systemic process; I need to check for red flags such as widespread erosive disease, failure of appropriate therapy, periorificial or acral lesions, alopecia, or systemic symptoms, which should prompt evaluation for entities like acrodermatitis enteropathica, LCH, or immunodeficiency, and in oncology patients with mucositis or extensive DD, aggressive barrier strategies and early nutritional support are emphasized to mitigate complications [^113rHkc1] [^117M2cwy].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety monitoring; I will reassess in 48–72 hours to ensure improvement, limit any steroid course to 7 days or less, avoid abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use, and counsel caregivers to return if the rash worsens, spreads, bleeds, or is accompanied by fever, poor feeding, or lethargy, because these findings may signal secondary infection or an alternate diagnosis requiring re-evaluation [^notfound].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence: confirm diagnosis and severity; implement universal prevention with frequent changes, gentle cleansing, thorough drying, and thick barrier at every change; for mild disease, continue barrier care; for moderate disease, add low-potency hydrocortisone 1% for up to 7 days; for severe or erosive disease, obtain KOH and treat candidiasis with miconazole-based therapy if confirmed, consider a short steroid course only if inflammation is marked and avoid medium/high-potency agents; and always reassess in 2–3 days, escalating workup if there is no improvement or if red flags emerge, which aligns with pediatric primary care and dermatology guidance [^116zAFEX] [^1115YjRe] [^113sbrwj].

Diaper dermatitis is best managed with **frequent diaper changes** [^117G83X7], **gentle cleansing** [^116MSLv8], and **thick barrier creams** (zinc oxide or petrolatum) [^114nXbzT] at each change [^116WCRUL]. For moderate inflammation, apply a low-potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) [^116zAFEX] for 7–10 days [^notfound]. If Candida is suspected or confirmed, add a topical antifungal (e.g. miconazole, nystatin) [^113sbrwj] for 7–14 days [^notfound]. Persistent or severe cases warrant evaluation for secondary infection or alternative diagnoses [^115zKRec] [^1131eJVM]. Educate caregivers on hygiene, barrier use, and avoidance of irritants; most cases resolve within a week with consistent care [^111UNjiT].

---

## General principles of management

- **Frequent diaper changes**: Change diapers promptly to minimize exposure to urine and feces, which contain irritants and enzymes that damage the skin barrier [^117G83X7] [^112wz9va].

- **Gentle cleansing**: Use lukewarm water and mild, fragrance-free cleansers or wipes [^115uWVFx]; avoid harsh soaps, alcohol-based wipes, and vigorous rubbing, which can further irritate the skin [^116F9gVD] [^117G83X7].

- **Barrier protection**: Apply a thick layer of barrier cream (zinc oxide or petrolatum-based) at each diaper change to protect the skin from moisture and irritants [^114nXbzT] [^112wz9va].

- **Diaper-free time**: Allow the infant to spend time without a diaper daily to promote skin drying and healing [^112wz9va].

---

## Topical treatments

### Barrier creams and ointments

Barrier creams and ointments are **first-line therapy** [^116a4e6i]. Zinc oxide provides anti-inflammatory and protective properties; apply a thick layer at each diaper change [^notfound]. Petrolatum-based ointments create an occlusive barrier that prevents contact with irritants and helps maintain skin hydration [^notfound].

---

### Topical corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Use for moderate inflammation (erythema, edema, papules) unresponsive to barrier creams alone [^116zAFEX].

- **Recommended agent**: Low-potency corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) applied thinly twice daily for 7–10 days [^116fJvgt].

- **Precautions**: Avoid prolonged use (> 2 weeks) and high-potency steroids due to risk of skin atrophy, systemic absorption, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression [^114zX9sc] [^111YxnW1].

---

### Antifungal agents

Antifungal agents are indicated when **Candida albicans** is suspected or confirmed — typically presenting with beefy-red erythema and satellite pustules [^1168cD8Y] [^1164Eoit]. Recommended agents include miconazole, clotrimazole, or nystatin, applied twice daily for 7–14 days [^1164Eoit] [^1151tFF5]. Combination therapy with a topical corticosteroid and antifungal may be used for severe inflammatory cases, but limit the duration of steroid use to avoid adverse effects [^116F9gVD] [^114zX9sc].

---

### Alternative therapies

Breast milk has been shown in some studies to be as effective as **hydrocortisone 1%** for mild diaper dermatitis, though evidence is limited [^116fJvgt]. Natural remedies such as honey, olive oil, and beeswax mixtures have demonstrated clinical and mycological benefits in small studies, but larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy and safety [^111YhtBn].

---

## Management of severe or persistent cases

- **Evaluation**: Persistent or severe cases (> 7 days despite appropriate therapy) require evaluation for secondary bacterial infection, fungal infection, or alternative diagnoses (e.g. psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis) [^115zKRec] [^1131eJVM].

- **Secondary infection**: If bacterial infection is suspected, topical or systemic antibiotics may be indicated based on severity and culture results [^1155ZybN].

- **Specialized care**: Severe cases with extensive erosions or ulcerations may benefit from specialized dressings (e.g. hydrocolloid dressings) to promote healing and reduce pain [^117Kc2pn].

---

## Preventive strategies

- **Diaper selection**: Use superabsorbent disposable diapers to reduce moisture and skin irritation [^113PWz2S] [^116FSALk].

- **Hygiene practices**: Maintain regular bathing routines and use gentle, fragrance-free products [^notfound].

- **Barrier maintenance**: Continue regular application of barrier creams even after resolution to prevent recurrence [^114nXbzT].

- **Education**: Provide caregivers with clear instructions on diaper changing frequency, cleansing techniques, and recognition of complications [^111UNjiT].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Complications include **secondary bacterial infection** (commonly Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species) and fungal infection (Candida albicans) [^113sbrwj]. Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can cause skin atrophy, striae, and systemic effects such as HPA axis suppression, especially in infants [^111YxnW1] [^111VG9Fm]. Persistent or atypical rashes may indicate underlying systemic conditions (e.g. psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis) [^116F9gVD].

---

## Patient and caregiver education

Education should emphasize **frequent diaper changes** and gentle cleansing with mild products [^117G83X7]. Caregivers should apply barrier creams consistently and recognize signs of secondary infection or treatment failure that warrant medical evaluation [^116a4e6i]. Adherence to the treatment regimen and follow-up are essential for successful management and prevention of recurrence [^116EcTbX].

---

Diaper dermatitis is a common, self-limited condition in pediatric patients that responds well to conservative management. The cornerstone of treatment is **frequent diaper changes**, **gentle cleansing**, and **barrier protection** [^112wz9va]. Topical corticosteroids and antifungal agents are reserved for moderate to severe cases or when secondary infection is suspected. Persistent or severe cases require further evaluation for underlying conditions or complications.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition.

Diaper dermatitis leads to approximately 20% of all childhood dermatology visits. There have been several technologic advances in diaper design the last several years; however, due to the unique environment of the diaper area, many children continue to suffer from a variety of dermatologic conditions of this region. Common causes include allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, infection, and psoriasis. Treatments include allergen avoidance, barrier protection, parent education, and topical therapies.

### Incontinence-associated dermatitis: not just babies [^1155ZybN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD) is frequently observed in young children but can affect individuals throughout their lifespan. The broader term incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is used to describe inflammatory skin reactions from prolonged exposure to urine and/or feces. This review compares IAD and IDD in pediatric and geriatric populations, focusing on their pathogenesis, clinical considerations, and management. Both conditions involve prolonged bodily fluid exposure disrupting the skin barrier, making infants and older adults particularly susceptible due to their age-related skin characteristics. Factors such as fecal enzyme activity and diet in infants, and medications and comorbidities in older adults, also influence presentation. Particularly for IAD in the geriatric population, accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other conditions like pressure injuries and intertriginous dermatitis is crucial. Management prioritizes prevention, which includes frequent absorbent product changes and barrier creams. If the condition develops, treatment varies with severity, from barrier applications for mild cases to topical steroids for severe cases. Antifungals or antibiotics may be required for cases with superimposed infections. Future initiatives should concentrate on overcoming the difficulties related to IAD and IDD, such as alleviating physical discomfort, mitigating economic impact, and developing standardized terminology and research specifically tailored to geriatric care.

### Diaper dermatitis: etiology, manifestations, prevention, and management [^112wz9va]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatricians and parents report diaper dermatitis (DD) to be one of the most common skin diseases that affects almost every child at some point during the early months and years of life. Diapered skin is exposed to friction and excessive hydration, has a higher pH than nondiapered skin, and is repeatedly soiled with feces that contains enzymes with high irritation potential for the skin. The combination of these factors frequently results in skin damage, leading to visible erythematous lesions that can be irritating and painful to the child. Behavioral changes such as increased crying and agitation and changes in eating and sleeping patterns indicate emotional distress. Appropriate skin care can help to prevent the occurrence of DD and to speed up the healing of affected skin. This includes frequent diaper changes and aeration, gentle cleansing, and the use of a barrier cream. Mild to moderate cases usually resolve after a few days of following this routine, but the use of harsh cleaning products can exacerbate DD.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review and brief survey of eruptions of the diaper area [^112gM6Dm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Eruptions in the diaper area are the most common dermatologic problem in infancy. Such eruptions can be subdivided into primary diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area with an ill-defined and multifactorial etiology, and secondary diaper dermatitis, a term which encompasses eruptions in the diaper area with defined etiologies. The most important factors in the development of primary diaper dermatitis are: (i) water/moisture, (ii) friction, (iii) urine, (iv) feces, and (v) microorganisms (sometimes). Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use and using disposable diapers, barrier creams, mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.

### Diaper dye dermatitis [^111tqEZd]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is a common problem in outpatient pediatric office settings. Although most diaper rashes represent a form of contact dermatitis in response to irritants in the diaper environment, other rashes may be the result of an allergen in the diaper. On the basis of clinical examination results for 5 patients and patch testing results for 2 patients, we suspect that the patients demonstrated allergic contact dermatitis in response to the various blue, pink, and green dyes in diapers. Although topically administered corticosteroids are useful in the treatment regimen, the preferred treatment for allergic contact dermatitis in the diaper area is the use of dye-free diapers for allergen avoidance. Patch testing may also be valuable in identifying the allergen, because allergen avoidance is the key to prevention of recurrent disease.

### Differential diagnoses of diaper dermatitis [^115zKRec]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common contact eczema present in early childhood. The main cause is an irritant reaction to urine and feces, which is facilitated by the occlusive conditions under the diaper, leading to hyperhydration of the stratum corneum (diaper dermatitis). In addition, diaper pressure and friction can increase the risk of skin inflammation, which also opens the skin up to other irritant agents, allergens, and infectious agents, such as candida albicans. However, a variety of diseases are associated with inflammation of the skin in the diaper region, therefore the term "diaper dermatitis" is merely descriptive and does not reflect anything about the etiopathogenesis. The term diaper dermatitis refers only to an inflammation in the diapering area and should not be automatically equated with reactions to diapers. Making the correct diagnosis requires a thorough examination of the skin in its entirety and a detailed report of the patient's medical and family history. Once a specific pattern is identified, a precise diagnosis, and an appropriate therapy, can be determined.

### Diaper dermatitis-frequency and contributory factors in hospital attending children [^116EcTbX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of diaper dermatitis varies widely between published studies. It is a condition which causes considerable parental anxiety. To better understand the frequency of diaper dermatitis, treatment practices, and the current importance of previously identified etiologic factors, a questionnaire survey of parents who had children wearing diapers (n = 532) attending a large United Kingdom district general hospital was undertaken. At the time of survey, only 16% of the study population had diaper dermatitis. Forty-eight percent of the study population had never had an episode of diaper dermatitis. In a multivariate analysis, current diaper dermatitis was independently associated with four factors: presence of oral thrush, number of previous episodes, frequency of diaper changes, and diarrhea. Recurrent episodes of diaper dermatitis were associated with increasing age, lack of barrier cream use, current diaper rash, and frequency of diaper changes. In the majority of children with diaper dermatitis at the time of survey, treatment had been instituted in the community. Diaper dermatitis usually presents and is treated successfully outside the hospital setting and is not a common clinical problem in secondary care.

### Diaper dermatitis: a therapeutic dilemma. results of a double-blind placebo controlled trial of miconazole nitrate 0.25% [^1151tFF5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area, is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial compared the efficacy and safety of miconazole nitrate 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base with that of the ointment base alone in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants and evaluated the role of Candida albicans in the response to treatment. Infants age 2–13 months with diaper rash were treated with either miconazole nitrate 0.25% (N = 101) or ointment base (N = 101) for 7 days. Although improvement in rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3, 5, and 7, patients receiving miconazole nitrate 0.25% had significantly fewer rash sites and lower mean total rash scores on days 5 and 7 (p < 0.001). In the miconazole nitrate 0.25% group, improvement was most marked among those with moderate or severe diaper dermatitis at baseline and among patients whose baseline rashes were positive for C. albicans. Treatment with miconazole nitrate 0.25% was as safe as with ointment base alone. Miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment is a safe and effective treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Comparison of the effect of human milk and topical hydrocortisone 1% on diaper dermatitis [^116fJvgt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin problems in infants and children, affecting between 7% and 35% of infants. This randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy of hydrocortisone 1% ointment with that of human breast milk in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants ages 0 to 24 months. Infants with diaper rash were treated with either hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 70) or human breast milk (n = 71) for 7 days. Improvement in the rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3 and 7; there was no significant difference in total rash scores on days 3 and 7. Treatment with human breast milk was as effective as hydrocortisone 1% ointment alone. Human breast milk is an effective and safe treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review of 63 children [^112Jz5CL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is a common infantile dermatosis with a highly variable prevalence and incidence. This study aimed to present the demographic and clinical features of babies with DD.

Methods

Data, including demographic and clinical features, obtained from DD patient forms were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The study included 63 babies with DD (female: n = 35 [55.6%]; male: n = 28 [44.4%]; mean age 11.6 mos). Most of the patients (43.5%) were 0 to 6 months of age. In all, 76.3% were breastfed, of whom 31.7% were exclusively breastfed. The number of previous episodes of DD was significantly lower in breastfed babies. The most common diaper area cleansing method was wet wipes (54.1%). Diaper creams were used in 86.2% of patients. DD was severe in 22.2% of patients, moderate in 57.4%, and mild in 20.4%. Candida infection was noted in 77.4% of patients. The median number of previous episodes of DD was significantly higher in patients with Candida infection than in those without (p = 0.02). Treatment yielded greater than 50% improvement (complete and moderate response) in 59.4% of patients at the first follow-up visit (3–5 days) and 82.6% at the second follow-up visit (10 days).

Conclusion

Most babies with DD were 0 to 6 months of age. Breastfed babies had fewer previous episodes of DD, so mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies to reduce the incidence of DD. Candida infection was common; clinicians should be aware of its association with DD.

### Hydrocolloid dressing for the treatment of severe diaper dermatitis [^117Kc2pn]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is a common dermatosis that usually responds to adequate hygiene and topical treatment, but can be a therapeutic challenge. Continuous exposure to feces and urine can cause extensive erosions and pain. The use of hydrocolloid dressings may be helpful in keeping the skin isolated from stool and urine, reducing pain, and enabling skin lesions to heal. We explain an easy technique, utilizing stoma powder and a hydrocolloid dressing, for parents to apply at home.

### Diapering, diaper technology, and diaper area skin health [^115UCxqG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Disposable diapers are the most common diaper care practice in Western societies today, and their use continues to increase globally. Improvements in disposable diaper technology have helped to reduce the prevalence and severity of diaper dermatitis (DD) over the course of the last few decades. This article reviews how changes in disposable diaper technology interact with the various etiological factors in DD, thus helping to improve overall diaper area skin health for children around the world.

### Characteristics of persistent diaper dermatitis in children with food allergy [^112QkcfZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Diaper dermatitis is often caused by irritant contact occurring beneath the diaper of an infant, and it is aggravated by factors such as dampness, friction, urea, and feces. Food-allergic patients are known to exhibit various skin lesions ranging from urticaria to eczema. This study aims to determine the relationship between persistent diaper dermatitis and food allergy.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of persistent diaper dermatitis between August 2015 and November 2017.

Results

The study included 157 patients diagnosed with persistent diaper dermatitis (67 male, 72 female; median age: 13 months). Diaper dermatitis was more common and included the whole perineum in children who had multiple food allergies (P = 0.001). In children with multiple food allergies, the course of diaper dermatitis was more severe, and the condition did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025). A longer elimination diet was required for patients with Type I reactions and persistent diaper dermatitis (P = 0.018). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more diffuse and covered the whole perineum (P = 0.025). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more severe and did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025).

Conclusions

Persistent diaper dermatitis lasting longer than a month may be associated with food allergy. The diaper rash may also be the only indicator of the food allergy. Elimination of the responsible food may allow these patients to recover from persistent diaper dermatitis.

### Hydrocortisone (Alacort) [^111Zcv8B]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Information for the Patient

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.

2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed.

3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.

4. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing.

5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.

### Symmetric red-purple papules in the diaper region [^112QcAaR]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate intervention at this time?
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen
E. Tissue culture
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants — Correct. The most appropriate intervention at this time is barrier cream and avoiding further irritation. GGI typically resolves spontaneously over weeks to months with conservative management aimed at preventing irritation in the region. Caretakers should also be counseled on frequent diaper changes.
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Caution should be used in applying class I topical steroids to the diaper area because of the high risk of adverse effects, especially in the setting of an occlusive diaper. In addition, because of the controversial relationship between topical steroids and GGI, their use is not recommended.
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week — Incorrect. Ketoconazole 2% cream may be beneficial in treating candidal diaper dermatitis if it coexists with GGI, but that is not the primary process in our patient.
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen — Incorrect. Given the tendency for GGI to resolve spontaneously, holding off on obtaining a biopsy specimen is reasonable at this time in this infant. If the lesions fail to improve or the patient develops systemic symptoms, obtaining a biopsy specimen should be considered to rule out a more serious pathology.
E. Tissue culture — Incorrect. GGI is not an infectious process and therefore tissue culture would not be helpful.

### Mometasone furoate (Elocon) [^113WtMBs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from
equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS — Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued and
appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids
is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a
clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing
corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate
diagnostic patch testing.

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does
not occur promptly, use of ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued until the
infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the
following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for
external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for
which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped
so as to be occlusive, unless directed by the physician.

### Clinical approaches to skin cleansing of the diaper area: practice and challenges [^116MSLv8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Cleansing and care of the diaper area require special consideration to maintain barrier function of the skin in this area and repair the barrier when it is compromised. Diaper dermatitis occurs commonly; understanding and modification of predisposing factors are imperative for caregivers. In this paper, we review important factors in diaper area care, including skin pH, the local microbiome, irritant and allergic potential of contactants, and application of topical agents.

### Topical breast milk plus zinc oxide versus zinc oxide alone for diaper rash in infants under 1 year: a randomized clinical trial [^113ZkLMs]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Diaper dermatitis (DD) is a common inflammatory skin condition in infants, typically managed with supportive care and anti-inflammatory treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical breast milk combined with zinc oxide versus zinc oxide alone in treating DD in infants. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Bahrami Children's Hospital from 2022 to 2023. Forty-two infants with clinically diagnosed DD were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group received 25% zinc oxide ointment, while the case group received 25% zinc oxide combined with topical breast milk. Both treatments were applied for 7 consecutive days. The severity of DD was assessed daily using the Buckley Diaper Dermatitis Severity Scale, and lesion improvement was documented. Results: The mean age of the infants was 2.93 ± 7.41 months, and 52.4% were male. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in baseline characteristics. Complete and partial recovery rates in the case group were 61.9% and 38.1%, respectively, compared to 66.6% and 19.1% in the control group. Notably, no non-responders were found in the case group, while 14.3% in the control group showed no response to treatment. The case group experienced faster lesion resolution (2.52 ± 0.67 days vs. 3.28 ± 1.14 days, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Topical breast milk combined with zinc oxide may reduce recovery time in treating diaper dermatitis. This approach is safe, cost-effective, and accessible. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm these results and establish standardized treatment protocols.

### Myths on chemical burns in the diaper area [^116HHcn2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past several years, a number of articles and online posts have circulated on the Internet associating use of disposable and cloth diapers with chemical burns on babies' skin. Because both mild chemical burns and diaper dermatitis (diaper rash) can cause skin redness and peeling, it is not surprising that some confusion has arisen regarding the association between these two conditions. However, diapers cannot cause chemical burns because they are made of inert materials. Diaper rash and chemical burns are distinct conditions that require different evaluation and treatment, which is why it is important for pediatricians to help parents understand the difference.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^117G83X7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Diaper Care

Diaper dermatitis is common, affecting most infants at least once 31. The occlusive diaper environment plays host to a complex interplay of potentially damaging factors. Alkaline urine disrupts the pH balance of the epidermis, which encourages microbial overgrowth and activation of fecal lipases, endogenous and exogenous proteases and bile salts, all of which can lead to further injury 32, 33. New recommendations were developed to provide guidance on routine care of the diaper area (Table 7).

Table 7
New Recommendations on Diaper Care

To reduce the risk of diaper dermatitis and manage the condition should it occur, it was strongly recommended that the diaper area be kept clean and dry and that diapers should be changed as often as necessary. The need to keep the diaper area dry was highlighted, as prolonged and excessive humidity can increase friction, lead to skin maceration, increase permeability, and encourage microbial overgrowth 34. Because excessive scrubbing and rubbing of the diaper area may promote irritation and further damage the barrier properties of the skin surface 24, 35, 36, it was strongly recommended that drying should be achieved through air drying or gentle patting with a dry towel or dry cotton balls/squares.

### Mometasone furoate (Elocon) [^114ctMfT]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Apply a thin film of ELOCON Cream 0.1% to the affected skin areas
once daily. ELOCON Cream 0.1% may be used in pediatric patients 2 years of age
or older. Since safety and efficacy of ELOCON Cream 0.1% have not been
adequately established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age, its use in
this age group is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric Use section).

As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is
achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis
may be necessary. Safety and efficacy of ELOCON Cream 0.1% in pediatric patients
for more than 3 weeks of use have not been established.

ELOCON Cream 0.1% should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed
by a physician. ELOCON Cream 0.1% should not be applied in the diaper area if
the child still requires diapers or plastic pants as these garments may
constitute occlusive dressing.

### Differential diagnosis of diaper dermatitis [^1131eJVM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Mild diaper dermatitis often occurs in children before toilet training is complete, particularly from 9 to 12 months of age, and the most common presentation is an irritant contact dermatitis. Diaper dermatitis may account for up to 25% of dermatology visits to health care providers during the first year of life. Fortunately, since the introduction of hypoallergenic, superabsorbent modern disposable diapers, the incidence and severity of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis has decreased dramatically. Diaper dermatitis broadly refers to skin disorders that occur in the diaper area, such as skin eruptions triggered by diapers, rashes exacerbated by the diaper, and other events that occur in the diaper area. A number of skin conditions that can occur anywhere on the skin may present with distinctive findings in the diaper area. The following discussion will review the most common triggers of diaper dermatitis and contact irritant dermatitis, while focusing on the skin conditions that may be associated or overlap clinically with contact dermatitis.

### Absorption and efficacy of miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment in infants with diaper dermatitis [^116NKd9b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The potential for toxicity from systemic absorption of topical miconazole in infants is a concern.

Objective

To assess the relative safety of 0.25% miconazole based on the amount absorbed through the skin of infants with diaper dermatitis after multiple applications.

Methods

Of 24 infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis, 19 received 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment and 5 received 2% miconazole nitrate cream for 7 days at each diaper change and after bathing. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and after 7 days.

Results

In the 0.25% treatment group, blood concentrations of miconazole were nondetectable (< 1 ng/mL) in 83% (15/18) and minimal (3.0 to 3.8 ng/mL) in 17% (3/18). Samples were missing for one patient. For the 5 infants in the 2% treatment group, miconazole concentration was nondetectable in 20% (1/5) and less than 7.4 ng/mL in 4 infants. No adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

Systemic absorption of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was minimal, demonstrating its safety in the treatment of moderate to severe diaper dermatitis.

### Diaper dermatitis that does not quit [^117F8u9C]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants. The humid, moist environment under the diaper makes the skin more susceptible to injury from exposure to irritants particularly related to urine and feces. A gentle cleansing routine, frequent diaper changes, and a thick barrier cream help control this condition. Irritant diaper dermatitis should be distinguished from other skin conditions that may develop in this sensitive area.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113sbrwj]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VUSION Ointment is indicated for adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and /or budding yeast) in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance. (1.2)

1.1 	Indication

VUSION Ointment is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis only when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast), in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. A positive fungal culture for Candida albicans is not adequate evidence of candidal infection since colonization with C. albicans can result in a positive culture. The presence of candidal infection should be established by microscopic evaluation prior to initiating treatment.

VUSION should be used as part of a treatment regimen that includes measures directed at the underlying diaper dermatitis, including gentle cleansing of the diaper area and frequent diaper changes. VUSION should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes.

1.2 	Limitations of Use

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients, or in infants less than 4 weeks of age (premature or term).

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been evaluated in incontinent adult patients. VUSION should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, such as in an adult institutional setting, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance.

### Case report: diaper dermatitis presenting as pustules [^1168cD8Y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. Its cause can often be determined clinically based on the clinical presentation. Primary diaper dermatitis is associated with irritants and spares the deep skin folds. Secondary diaper dermatitis is most often caused by Candida yeast overgrowth and typically presents as a well-defined area of beefy red erythema covering the diaper area and including the deep folds of skin with hallmark satellite pustules. Other causes include seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and, in the setting of a primarily pustular eruption, bacterial folliculitis. A simple potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) can confirm the diagnosis of candida diaper dermatitis and guide proper treatment.

### Prevention of diaper dermatitis in infants – a literature review [^113BVL4u]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions in neonates and infants, with a peak between the ages of 9 and 12 months. Appropriate skin care practices that support skin barrier function and protect the buttocks skin from urine and feces are supposed to be effective in the prevention of DD. Despite many recommendations for parents and caregivers on proper diaper skin care, there is no up-to-date synthesis of the available evidence to develop recommendations for DD prevention practice. Therefore we performed a systematic literature review on the efficacy of nonmedical skin care practices on the diapered area of healthy, full-term infants ages 0 to 24 months. We identified 13 studies covering skin care practices such as cleansing, bathing, and application of topical products. DD prevalence and incidence and physiologic skin parameters were used as efficacy parameters. The results of this review indicate that cleansing of the diaper area using baby wipes or water and a washcloth have comparable effects on diapered skin. Bathing with a liquid baby cleanser twice weekly seems comparable with water alone. The application of ointments containing zinc oxide or petrolatum with or without vitamin A seems to have comparable effects on DD severity. There seems to be no information on whether single skin care practices such as cleansing, bathing, and application of topical preparations can prevent DD. High-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to show the effectiveness of skin care practices for controlling and preventing DD.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^111UNjiT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is an acute, episodic inflammatory condition characterized by erythema, papules, and pustules in the diapered area. While common, DD is rarely serious from a medical standpoint, but can cause discomfort for infants and anxiety for caregivers. 1, 2, 3 Literature estimates of DD rates vary greatly, ranging from 16% to 65%, and given the short duration of DD (typically 2‐4 days), most cases are not seen by a medical professional. 3, 4, 5, 6

Diaper dermatitis has many causes, including skin overhydration, friction, frequent, and prolonged exposure to urine or feces (which contain pH‐sensitive proteases and lipases), and associated elevated skin pH and alterations in the skin microbiome. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Diaper dermatitis can be superimposed on or mistaken for other skin disorders with impaired barrier function including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the diapered skin typically being spared in the latter. 12 Protecting diapered skin entails reducing overhydration from urine or high humidity, maintaining skin's normal acidic pH, and minimizing contact with feces and urine. 11 To achieve this, strategies include using highly absorbent disposable diapers, frequent diaper changes, cleaning stool from skin with water or optimally formulated baby wipes, and emollient application. 6, 13, 14, 15 While common, the direct impact of these strategies is not well understood.

Previous investigations on DD are derived from hospital admissions or doctor office visits, which are unlikely to reflect real‐world settings, and do not consistently report the anatomic location or severity. In the present investigation, we studied DD experienced from three disparate geographies, each with different approaches to diapering habits and skin care.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117M2cwy]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — infant considerations — respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with a single dose of nirsevimab IM or monthly palivizumab IM should be considered before the onset of the RSV season, and RSV treatment with ribavirin may be recommended in certain scenarios. Aggressive nutritional support should be initiated at diagnosis and continued throughout therapy due to high risk of protein-calorie malnutrition. Strongly recommend barrier techniques and frequent diaper changes. Consider placement of a Foley catheter during administration and urinary excretion of daunorubicin and high-dose MTX due to high risk of skin ulceration. In infants with extensive mucositis or diaper dermatitis, Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be strongly considered due to increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and intestinal perforation. Strongly consider broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal therapy, and/or antiviral therapy based on clinical evaluation. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Alclometasone dipropionate [^111tZ8J5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface area to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, alclometasone dipropionate ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of alclometasone dipropionate ointment should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

In a transgenic mouse study, chronic use of alclometasone dipropionate cream led to an increased number of animals with benign neoplasms of the skin at the treatment site (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility). The clinical relevance of the findings in animal studies to humans is not clear.

### A natural cream-to-powder formulation developed for the prevention of diaper dermatitis in diaper-wearing infants and children: barrier property and in-use tolerance studies [^116WCRUL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diaper dermatitis is a common condition that develops in the diaper area due to factors such as elevated moisture, increased skin surface pH, and exposure to irritants from urine and feces. These factors suggest interventions to prevent or treat diaper dermatitis such as exposing the skin to air, frequent diaper changes, and thorough cleansing of the diaper area. Barrier creams and powders also have a role in preventing and treating diaper dermatitis. We developed a cream-to-powder product with a formula based on corn starch and other natural ingredients for use in the diaper area.

Methods

Dye exclusion study: The barrier properties of the cream-to-powder product were assessed using a dye exclusion protocol. Skin color at treated and untreated forearm sites was measured at baseline and after exposure to crystal violet stain. The cream-to-powder product's ability to inhibit the water-soluble dye from reaching the skin was judged by comparing color changes at the treated and untreated sites. Tolerance-in-use study: The safety of the cream-to-powder product was assessed in a four-week tolerance-in-use study conducted in a group of 52 diaper-wearing infants and toddlers. Subjects' parents/guardians applied the cream-to-powder product at each diaper change. A pediatrician judged safety endpoints of erythema, dryness, and edema in the diaper area at baseline and at study end. Parents/guardians also completed a questionnaire at study end. These studies have complied with Good Clinical Practices (GCP/ICH).

Outcomes

The cream-to-powder product prevented about 70% of the test dye from reaching the skin surface, demonstrating its ability to supplement the skin barrier. The tolerance-in-use study showed no statistically significant changes in any of the safety endpoints; there were no adverse events. Parents/guardians responses to the cream-to-powder product were overwhelmingly positive. Taken together, these results support that the cream-to-powder formulation is safe and effective for helping to prevent diaper dermatitis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(5):566–570.

### Betamethasone dipropionate (Diprolene) [^111YxnW1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.4	Pediatric Use

Use of DIPROLENE Ointment in pediatric patients younger than 13 years of age is not recommended due to the potential for HPA axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In an open-label HPA axis safety trial in subjects 3 months to 12 years of age with atopic dermatitis, DIPROLENE AF Cream 0.05% was applied twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 58% (range 35% to 95%). In 19 of 60 (32%) evaluable subjects, adrenal suppression was indicated by either a ≤ 5 mcg/dL pre-stimulation cortisol, or a cosyntropin post-stimulation cortisol ≤ 18 mcg/dL and/or an increase of < 7 mcg/dL from the baseline cortisol. Out of the 19 subjects with HPA axis suppression, 4 subjects were tested 2 weeks after discontinuation of DIPROLENE AF Cream, and 3 of the 4 (75%) had complete recovery of HPA axis function. The proportion of subjects with adrenal suppression in this trial was progressively greater, the younger the age group.

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids.

Rare systemic effects such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids.

Local adverse reactions including skin atrophy have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.

Avoid use of DIPROLENE Ointment in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of DIPROLENE Ointment included 225 subjects who were 65 years of age and over and 46 subjects who were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^114TNSM6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Cleansing is fundamental to the care of all babies; there is growing realization that suboptimal routine skin care may alter the balance of genetic and environmental factors to transform the healthy epidermis into one associated with barrier dysfunction and attendant disease, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) 1. Therefore there is a need for evidence‐based recommendations to guide health care professionals and parents in this critical aspect of care. This is particularly pertinent in view of confusion that parents and health care workers express regarding the use of water alone for bathing versus the use of bathing products 2.

The recommendations of the first European roundtable meeting were published in 2009 3; a second meeting was convened to review and update these recommendations in light of new data and to expand their scope to include diaper care and the application of emollients and oils to healthy skin and to assess the strength of recommendations using an established grading system.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^117EkQgR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients under 17 years of age is not recommended.

Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in pediatric patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream. In open-label trials, 17 of 43 (39.5%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea pedis demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing. In another open-label trial, 8 of 17 (47.1%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea cruris demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing.

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are, therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy, including striae, when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Avoid use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream under occlusion, such as in diaper dermatitis, is not recommended.

Postmarket adverse event reporting for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients aged 65 and above includes reports of skin atrophy and rare reports of skin ulceration. Caution should be exercised with the use of these corticosteroid-containing topical products on thinning skin.

Topical therapy with glucocorticoids (GCs) is used commonly in chronic dermatoses. Side effects are less common compared to systemic use; however, newer potent preparations may have serious side effects. A potential danger is their inappropriate use. Three infants who developed iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome and prolonged adrenal suppression in the course of GC therapy for simple diaper dermatitis are described. One patient also developed steatohepatitis which is uncommon with local GCs.

### Topical therapy for dermatophytoses: should corticosteroids be included? [^113f4CGC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses, commonly known as ringworm or tinea, represent superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, which are among the most common infections encountered in medicine. The use of corticosteroid-containing combinations in dermatophyte infections that are usually treated with topical medications is still a much-debated issue. The addition of a corticosteroid to local antifungal therapy may be of value in reducing local inflammatory reaction and thus carries the theoretical advantage of rapid symptom relief in acute dermatophyte infections associated with heavy inflammation. However, the use of such combinations requires caution as they have some potential risks, especially with long-term use under occlusive conditions. Corticosteroid-induced cutaneous adverse effects have been reported primarily in pediatric patients due to inappropriate application of these preparations on diaper areas. Additionally, the corticosteroid component may interfere with the therapeutic actions of the antifungal agent, or fungal growth may accelerate because of decreased local immunologic host reaction, such that underlying infection may persist, and dermatophytes may even acquire the ability to invade deeper tissues. Analysis of the literature documenting clinical study data and adverse reactions related to combination therapy, drew the following conclusions: (i) combination products containing a low potency nonfluorinated corticosteroid may initially be used for symptomatic inflamed lesions of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, in otherwise healthy adults with good compliance; (ii) therapy should be substituted by a pure antifungal agent once symptoms are relieved, and should never exceed 2 weeks for tinea cruris and 4 weeks for tinea pedis/corporis; and (iii) contraindications for the use of these combinations include application on diaper or other occluded areas and facial lesions, as well as in children < 12 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients for any reason.

### Diaper (napkin) dermatitis: a fold (intertriginous) dermatosis [^116F9gVD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Diaper (napkin) dermatitis is an acutely presenting inflammatory irritant contact dermatitis of the diaper region. It is one of the most common dermatologic diseases in infants and children. In the past, the disease was thought to be caused by ammonia; however, a number of factors, such as friction, wetness, inappropriate skin care, microorganisms, antibiotics, and nutritional defects, are important. Diaper dermatitis commonly affects the lower parts of the abdomen, thighs, and diaper area. Involvement of skin fold regions is typical with diaper dermatitis. At the early stages of the disease, only dryness is observed in the affected area. At later stages, erythematous maceration and edema can be seen. Secondary candidal and bacterial infections can complicate the dermatitis. In the differential diagnosis of the disease, allergic contact dermatitis, intertrigo, psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, and the other diseases should be considered. Causes of the disease should be determined and eliminated primarily. Families need to be informed about the importance of a clean, dry diaper area and the frequency of diaper changes. The use of superabsorbent disposable diapers has decreased the incidence of the disease. Soap and alcohol-containing products should be avoided in cleaning the area. In some cases, corticosteroids and antifungal agents can be administered. If necessary, antibacterial agents and calcineurin inhibitors can also be beneficial.

### Fluticasone propionate [^116mXYg8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use -

Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis.

Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued if control is achieved before 4 weeks. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact a physician. The safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 4 weeks in this population have not been established.

The safety and efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% in pediatric patients below 3 months of age have not been established.

Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use this medication in the treatment of diaper dermatitis unless directed by the physician. Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be applied in the diaper areas as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing.

Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients, ages 2 and 5 years old, who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35% of the body surface area. Follow-up testing 12 days after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Adverse effects including striae have been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.

### Neonatal skin care: developments in care to maintain neonatal barrier function and prevention of diaper dermatitis [^116FSALk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding the importance of the barrier function of the skin of preterm and term neonates is crucial in effective neonatal skin and diaper care. This literature search aimed to review the development of different practices in neonatal care to maintain skin barrier function, in turn preventing diaper dermatitis.

Methods

We performed two quantitative literature searches of English language studies: an initial literature search of studies published in the last 5 years was conducted using Cinahl, Medline, Embase, British Nursing Index, and DelphiS, followed by a second search of publications from 1990 to 2017 using the National Institute of Clinical Excellence Health Databases Advanced Search using key words, synonyms, and Boolean phrasing. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance.

Results

One hundred ten studies were analyzed for the purpose of this review; however, data are of variable quality. Guidance can be drawn from the existing literature relating to best practice options for diaper area cleansing methods, diaper type selection, and use of barrier creams. More research is required into the benefit or otherwise of diaper-free time.

Conclusions

Super-absorbent diapers reduce moisture at skin level and reduce diaper dermatitis. Barrier creams carry benefit both in prevention and cure but do not provide a substitute for frequent diaper changes. The literature does not demonstrate superiority of one cleansing method over another, but neither the use of wipes nor water increases diaper dermatitis prevalence. Further studies are required to explore the potential benefit of diaper-free time, taking due consideration of the practicalities, particularly for vulnerable neonates within the Intensive Care setting.

### The importance of skincare for neonates and infants: an algorithm [^116a4e6i]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The skin of neonates and infants undergoes a maturation process from birth and is susceptible to barrier disruption. The current algorithm follows a US-based consensus paper on skincare approaches using gentle cleansers and moisturizers in neonatal and healthy infant skin. This summary provides clinical information for pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, and pediatric healthcare providers treating neonates and infants.

Methods

The project used a modified Delphi process comprising virtual discussions followed by an online follow-up replacing the use of a questionnaire. During the virtual meeting, the systematic literature review results and a draft algorithm addressing over-the-counter skincare for neonates and infants with healthy skin were discussed and adopted using evidence coupled with the expert opinion and experience of the panel.

Results

The algorithm addresses three clinical signs: xerosis, erythema, and erosion/bulla. A growing body of evidence recognizes the benefits of ongoing daily use of non-alkaline cleansers and ceramides containing moisturizers to reduce inflammation and maintain a healthy skin barrier function. Diaper rash is common in infants presenting as erythema or, in more severe cases, skin erosion. Skin protection with a barrier cream and frequent diaper changes using disposable diapers resolves most cases; however, if the rash continuous despite appropriate care, rule out a candida infection.

Conclusion

The current algorithm focuses on neonatal and infant healthy skin that can benefit from skincare. When applied from birth onwards, gentle cleansers and moisturizers containing barrier lipids help maintain the protective skin barrier. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11):1195–1205. doi:10.36849/JDD.6219.

### Topical triamcinolone induced Cushing syndrome: a case report [^111VG9Fm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

We present a case of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and adrenal insufficiency in a newborn secondary to an overuse of triamcinolone cream 0.1% prescrived for the treatment of diaper dermatitis. This case highlignts the risks of systemic absorption when prescribing topical medications in the diaper area of an infant, and the importance of caution and proper follow up when prescribing even mid potency steroids to pediatric patients.

### Wet-wrap treatment in children with atopic dermatitis: a practical guideline [^113jQ3RY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of children with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) can be especially challenging because several possible intervention treatments have (relative) contraindications in childhood. In recent years, wet-wrap treatment (WWT) has been advocated as a relatively safe and efficacious intervention in children with severe or refractory AD. The goal of this article is to provide a practical guideline as a starting point for clinicians who are interested in using WWT in their own clinical practice. We will address several practical issues surrounding the use of WWT by describing our own experiences, supplemented with data from the literature.

### Skin care of the diaper area [^116xZ4Ee]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The skin of the diaper area has special needs for protection from the irritating effects of urine and feces and prevention of diaper dermatitis. These needs include products such as diapers that absorb the excreta, as well as products for cleansing and conditioning the skin. A number of factors play a role in development of diaper dermatitis, including prolonged exposure to excreta, alterations in skin pH or increased hydration, and changes in skin microbial flora. Recent decades have seen great improvements in our understanding of these factors and our ability to develop new and better products to protect baby skin. Better diaper designs and the development of pH-buffered baby wipes have improved the care of skin in the diaper area. Continuing research offers the promise of new products with additional benefits for caregivers and infants.

### Perceptions of physicians and pediatric patients about atopic dermatitis, its impact, and its treatment [^114GTGey]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The National Eczema Association for Science and Education surveyed 429 patients with atopic dermatitis or their parents and 303 physicians about atopic dermatitis, its effect on quality of life (QOL), and the adequacy of available treatments. The physician survey focused on disease severity and management; the patient survey, on disease severity, impact on QOL, and treatment preferences. Physician and patient/parent respondents generally agreed about their assessments of disease severity, poor effectiveness of over-the-counter products, and the need for more patient support groups and toll-free phone information. Atopic dermatitis significantly impacts QOL in children, particularly in those with moderate-to-severe disease. New treatments should offer enhanced efficacy, less frequent application, and fewer adverse effects.

### Cutaneous manifestations in pediatric oncology patients [^115bxUfr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Oncology patients present with various skin manifestations related to primary disease and treatments. Although these skin toxicities are well described in adults, studies of pediatric oncology patients are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cutaneous findings in pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study conducted from December 2018 to March 2020, all pediatric oncology patients were examined and patients who had a dermatologic finding at any point during their treatments were recorded. Dermatologic examinations were performed by the same dermatologists, and biopsy and microbiologic tests were performed according to clinical need. Patients were grouped according to their oncologic diagnoses and types of chemotherapies.

Results

A total of 80 patients with a mean age of 9.1 ± 5.0 years were included in the study. Seventy-five (93.7%) of them developed a dermatologic manifestation during the study period. Most of the patients had hematologic malignancies (n = 48, 60%). Antimetabolites were the most frequently used class of chemotherapeutic agents. Anagen effluvium was the most common dermatologic finding (61.3%, n = 49), followed by inflammatory dermatoses (51.2%, n = 41, most commonly diaper dermatitis in 33 patients), xerosis (35%, n = 28), and nail changes (20%, n = 16, most commonly nail pigmentation in seven patients). Mucositis was seen in 13 (16.2%) patients. Five patients (6.2%) had drug-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation, and five (6.2%) had toxic erythema of chemotherapy. The highest percentage of xerosis (45.4%) was detected in patients using antitumor antibiotics, whereas inflammatory dermatoses were observed more in patients using antimetabolites (48.6% of patients using antimetabolites), and pigmentation changes were more frequently detected in patients using alkylating agents.

Conclusion

Identification, diagnosis, and treatment of these reactions are important to dermatologists and oncologists so that appropriate management may be provided to pediatric oncology patients.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate, zinc oxide (clobezin) [^111GRyNr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Endocrine System

Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

Because of the potential for systemic corticosteroid effects, patients may need to be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.

In a small trial, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (BID) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing. In addition, 2 separate trials in pediatric subjects demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.2 Diaper Dermatitis

The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended.

5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions

Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical betamethasone products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Avoid contact of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.

### Betamethasone cream to treat diapers rash causing Cushing syndrome [^113oDTZ1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Betamethasone causing iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome (CS) in infants are rarely reported.

Case Presentation

In this case report, there were severe signs of CS, such as considerable weight acceleration and concurrent height deceleration, hirsutism and ecchymosis of the face, and buffalo pad, which are often found in adults. Clobetasol propionate, diflucortolone valerate, and dexamethasone nasal sprays were used in the majority of previously reported cases of corticosteroid abuse, whereas this is the first case of CS in an infant as a result of the use of betamethasone cream, also known as betnesol, which is frequently used by mothers in developing countries as a treatment for rashes. In this instance, a severe medication interaction caused by systemic betamethasone cream buildup led to the creation of CS. For the professionals, these patients are a challenge because of drug use without prescription.

Conclusions

Topical corticosteroid usage puts infants at risk for CS. Because of excessive betamethasone treatment in this child with diaper dermatitis, he acquired CS. It is said to draw attention to the risks of self-medication in developing nations.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate, zinc oxide (dermacinRx therazole pak) [^11468Y76]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on Endocrine
System

Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment.

In a small trial, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (twice a day) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing.

### Cushing's syndrome: hidden risk in usage of topical corticosteroids [^116c4oGz]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome in children may occur as a result of the application of exogenous steroids. Prolonged use of powerful corticosteroids suppresses adrenal functions and iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome may develop particularly in infants who are given topical corticosteroids. We report here a case on three infants having Cushing's syndrome with similar clinical presentations due to overuse of topical steroids for diaper dermatitis. The importance of exercising caution during the use of topical steroids is underlined in this study.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate, zinc oxide (dermacinRx therazole pak) [^1121nvZS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients under 17 years of age is not recommended.

Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in pediatric patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream. In open-label trials, 17 of 43 (39.5%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea pedis demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing. In another open-label trial, 8 of 17 (47.1%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea cruris demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing.

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are, therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy, including striae, when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Avoid use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream under occlusion, such as in diaper dermatitis, is not recommended.

Postmarket adverse event reporting for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients aged 65 and above includes reports of skin atrophy and rare reports of skin ulceration. Caution should be exercised with the use of these corticosteroid-containing topical products on thinning skin.

### Clinical and mycological benefits of topical application of honey, olive oil and beeswax in diaper dermatitis [^111YhtBn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Twelve infants suffering from diaper dermatitis were treated four times daily for 7 days with a mixture containing honey, olive oil and beeswax. The severity of erythema was evaluated on a five-point scale. Three infants had severe erythema and ulceration, four had moderate erythema, and five had moderate erythema with maceration. The initial mean lesion score of 2.91 ± 0.79 declined significantly (p < 0.05) to 2.0 ± 0.98 (day 3), 1.25 ± 0.96 (day 5) and 0.66 ± 0.98 (day 7). Candida albicans was isolated initially from four patients, but from only two patients after treatment. This topical treatment was safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated clinical and mycological benefits in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^111PbEEX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Skin care is fundamental to healthy infant development, but parents may be confused regarding best practice for this routine aspect of care 2. We hope that health care professionals will use these evidence‐based recommendations to guide parents with respect to the practical facets of cleansing, bathing, moisturizing, and care of the diaper region. Critical updates from the previous recommendations have been derived from clinical studies of liquid cleansers, wipes, and emollients; for example, the equivalence of wipes 41 and the noninferiority of a liquid cleanser 18 to water have been shown (in terms of skin hydration and transepidermal water loss, respectively), and studies have demonstrated that the use of such products does not influence skin barrier maturation 19, 37. Therefore clinical evidence demands a nuanced approach; parents should be reassured in their choice of infant skin care regime, be it the sole use of water or the use of appropriately formulated cleansers, wipes, emollients, and oils.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^115TzYZx]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Study 1 was a double-blind, multicenter study in which VUSION was compared to the zinc oxide and white petrolatum combination treatment and included 236 infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, complicated by candidiasis as documented by KOH tests that demonstrated pseudohyphae and/or budding yeasts. Study medication was applied at every diaper change for 7 days.

The primary endpoint was "Overall Cure" and required that subjects be both clinically cured (total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection) and microbiologically cured (eradication of candidiasis). Primary efficacy was assessed 1 week following the end of treatment, at Day 14.

Study results are shown in the following table.

Two additional studies provided supportive evidence of the clinical efficacy of VUSION in infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, some of whom cultured positive for C. albicans. However, candidal infection was not documented in the culture-positive subjects, as microscopic testing (e.g. KOH) was not done. Therefore, the positive culture results may have reflected colonization rather than infection.

### A multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans [^114bWszB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent. This open-label study investigated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans (C. albicans). Forty-four male and female subjects aged 6 to 29 months were included in the study. Study medication was applied topically to the affected diaper area twice daily for 1 week. Subjects were clinically evaluated at baseline and days 3, 7, and 14 (7 days post-treatment). Safety and efficacy variables included adverse events, mycological culture studies, KOH tests, Severity Scores, and Global Evaluation of Clinical Response. All adverse events were mild to moderate and considered not related to the study medication. Treatment provided statistically significant improvement (P < .05) for both the rate of mycological cure and reduction of Severity Score at each time point compared with baseline. Ciclopirox was safe and effective in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to C. albicans.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling

Patients using VUSION should be informed about the following information:

VUSION should be used only as directed by the health care provider.
VUSION should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes.
VUSION should not be used to prevent diaper dermatitis.
VUSION is for external use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
Gently cleanse the diaper area with lukewarm water or a very mild soap and pat the area dry with a soft towel before applying VUSION.
Gently apply VUSION to the diaper area with the fingertips after each diaper change. Do not rub VUSION into the skin as this may cause additional irritation.
Thoroughly wash hands after applying VUSION.
Treatment should be continued for 7 days, even if there is improvement. Do not use VUSION for longer than 7 days. If symptoms have not improved by day 7, see your health care provider.
VUSION should not be used on children for whom it is not prescribed.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^111ee4uC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Optimal Use of TCIs

Most treatment algorithms recommend regular use of emollients for control of dry skin with short-term TCS for treatment of AD flares. Under certain circumstances, TCIs are a more appropriate first-line choice and/or useful adjunct to TCS.
As a corticosteroid-sparing agent: Reducing the risks of chronic TCS exposure is important, especially in children treated with intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroids for other atopic diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. The corticosteroid-sparing effect of pimecrolimus cream has been demonstrated in clinical trials. A reduced number of flares and prolonged time-to-flare quantified in tacrolimus ointment clinical trials also supports a corticosteroid-sparing effect.
To treat face and skin fold disease: Skin atrophy, perioral dermatitis, and increased percutaneous absorption are TCS risks prompting greatest concern in patients with inflammatory skin disease involving sensitive skin areas on the face, eyelids, and diaper area. TCIs are well suited for use in these areas due to low acnegenic and atrophogenic potential.
To simplify treatment regimens: Risks associated with TCS use are highest with more potent products, especially when applied to sensitive skin areas. To minimize these risks, a popular approach is to recommend a two-drug treatment regimen using a lower potency TCS on the face and a higher potency product on the body. Patients are often confused about the appropriate drug to use on the affected sites, and monitoring the optimal quantity used can also be complicated. Maintenance treatment with a TCI requires use of only one product on all affected sites. This not only simplifies treatment for the patient, but also allows easier monitoring of drug quantity used over time.
For children who require daily treatment: Safety of TCS has been studied for durations of no longer than 4 weeks for a limited number of products. In contrast, safety of TCIs for durations of up to 1 year has been documented in several prospective trials and registries.
In patients who are TCS intolerant or dependent: Well-described but under-recognized complications of long-term use of TCS include delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, and rebound erythroderma. Neither pimecrolimus cream nor tacrolimus ointment carry these risks.
In patients with confirmed or suspected skin infection: 'In cognito' TCS-associated skin infections are another complication that has been well-described but underappreciated. The proposed mechanism of action is via dendritic cells and antigen presentation. In contrast, TCIs do not affect the differentiation, maturation, or function of dendritic cells. Clinical trials have not identified an increased incidence of skin infection for either TCI.

### Patient-reported impact of atopic dermatitis on pediatric and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe disease: results of a real-world, cross-sectional survey [^111iAYrs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

This study describes the disease burden in pediatric and adolescent patients with moderate‐to‐severe. Both groups of patients had high, but differing, disease burden; adolescent patients were more bothered by the visual and emotional aspects of their disease, whereas pediatric patients were more affected by scratching because of itch and the resulting impact on sleep. This highlights the need to incorporate disease burden in patient encounters and decision making for patients aged < 18 years and consider the potential value of improved treatment options for both pediatric and adolescent patients with moderate‐to‐severe, given the evolving treatment landscape.

### Effect of diaper cream and wet wipes on skin barrier properties in infants: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^114Bxram]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of different diaper care procedures on skin barrier function in infants has been minimally investigated and may be assessed using objective methods. In a single-center, prospective trial, 89 healthy 9-month-old infants (± 8 wks) were randomly assigned to three diaper care regimens: group I used water-moistened washcloths at diaper changes (n = 30), group II additionally applied diaper cream twice daily (n = 28), and group III used wet wipes and diaper cream twice daily (n = 31). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SCH), skin pH, interleukin 1α (IL-1α) levels, and microbiologic colonization were measured in diapered skin (upper outer quadrant of the buttocks), nondiapered skin (upper leg), and if diaper dermatitis (DD) occurred, using the most affected skin area at day 1 and weeks 4 and 8. Skin condition was assessed utilizing a neonatal skin condition score and diaper rash grade. On diapered skin, SCH decreased in groups II and III, whereas TEWL values were reduced in group II only. Skin pH increased in groups II and III. In general, SCH, skin pH, and IL-1α levels were higher in healthy diapered skin than in nondiapered skin. The incidence and course of DD was comparable in all groups. Areas with DD had greater TEWL and skin pH than unaffected skin areas. Infants who received diaper cream had lower SCH and TEWL and higher pH levels in the diapered area than on nondiapered skin. No correlation with the occurrence of DD was found.

### A prospective two-year assessment of miconazole resistance in Candida spp. with repeated treatment with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment in neonates and infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis [^114kwWfk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A petrolatum and zinc oxide-based ointment containing 0.25% miconazole nitrate is reported to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis (DDCC). This prospective, multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase IV study investigated the potential resistance of Candida spp. to repeated topical use of 0.25% miconazole nitrate in infants age 15 months and younger with moderate to severe DDCC. For initial and recurring episodes of DDCC over the 2-year study period, subjects were treated with a 7-day course of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment (active components: miconazole nitrate 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum 81.35%) with a 7-day follow-up. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were conducted before treatment (day 0) and 7 days after treatment (day 14). Potential resistance to miconazole was defined using an arbitrary breakpoint of minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL. There was no evidence of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. after single or repeated treatment courses of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment. For the initial episode of DDCC, 83 of 168 subjects (49.4%) achieved a clinical cure, 77 (45.8%) achieved a mycologic cure, and 49 (29.2%) achieved an overall cure (clinical and mycologic). The overall cure rate for recurrent episodes of DDCC was similar to or numerically greater than rates observed for the initial episode. Treatment of DDCC with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was effective and generally well tolerated. No evidence of the development of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. was observed.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^115XTyjH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical products are widely recommended for DD, and use was reported by > 70% of caregivers in this study. Prophylactic use was highest in China, but similar between the United States and Germany. While it is likely that prophylactic topical products were used to suppress rash, occasional use is difficult to interpret, since these products can also be used as medical treatments. The advantage of prophylactic cream/ointment use is supported by a reduction in DD in infants wearing diapers containing emollients with or without zinc oxide. 16, 17

Of the geographies studied, the United States and Germany had the most similar habits and practices. Lower DD observed in the United States compared with Germany was associated with higher packaged wipes usage, more frequent overnight diaper changes, and greater bathing frequency. These practices are consistent with current USA and European physician‐led organization recommendations: using superabsorbent breathable diapers, frequent diaper changes, and gentle, mildly acidic wipes or water for cleansing. 25, 26, 27

This study provides important insights on DD prevalence and severity and the impact of caregiver behaviors on DD. The finding that infants with more pigmented skin were scored as having less severe rash is an interesting finding and requires further investigation. Techniques to reduce DD include the use of barrier creams to help protect skin from overhydration and contact with fecal irritants. The association of a lower frequency of DD with lower skin pH supports the use of mildly acidic cleaning products (eg, specially formulated baby wipes and soaps) to help maintain the skin's acid mantle and reduce the risk of skin damage by fecal enzymes which are more active at neutral or alkaline pH. The finding that DD is more frequently located in the perianal and intertriginous areas indicates caregivers should pay particular attention to these areas. There may be less airflow through these areas resulting in a moister environment, and it may be more difficult to clean these areas; these sites may benefit the most from prophylactic topical product use. Collectively, these results provide important insights into approaches to reduce DD severity and improve babies' health and well‐being.

### Diaper need is associated with pediatric care use: an analysis of a nationally representative sample of parents of young children [^115GigLp]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the possible association between diaper need, difficulty affording an adequate amount of diapers, and pediatric care visits for urinary tract infections and diaper dermatitis.

Study Design

This cross-sectional analysis using nationally representative survey data collected July-August 2017 using a web-based panel examined 981 parents of children between 0 and 3 years of age in the US (response rate, 94%). Survey weighting for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse was used to estimate the prevalence of diaper need and to perform multivariable logistic regression of the association between parent reported diaper need and visits to the pediatrician for diaper rash or urinary tract infections within the past 12 months.

Results

An estimated 36% of parents endorsed diaper need. Both diaper need (aOR 2.37; 95% CI 1.69–3.31) and visiting organizations to receive diapers (aOR 2.14; 95% CI 1.43–3.21) were associated with diaper dermatitis visits. Similar associations were found for diaper need (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.54–4.49) and visiting organizations to receive diapers (aOR 4.50; 95% CI 2.63–7.70) for urinary tract infection visits.

Conclusions

Diaper need is common and associated with increased pediatric care visits. These findings suggest pediatric provider and policy interventions decreasing diaper need could improve child health and reduce associated healthcare use.

Figure 1
Diagram for scoring diaper dermatitis. The anatomic area of skin scoring is defined by the large black box/circle in each image. Two smaller reference shapes within the scoring area are approximately 2% or 10% of the total area covered. Images from left to right and top to bottom are female genitals; male genitals; intertriginous; perianal; buttocks

For temperature and relative humidity (RH) measures, babies were acclimated to room conditions ≥ 30 minutes before measures were taken. RH was measured using a thermohygrometer (Sato Keiryoki MFG. Co. LTD) covered with a breathable sleeve, allowing air exchange and preventing inadvertent sensor contact with liquid. Simultaneously, two thermohygrometer sensors were inserted into the diaper, near the genitals and along the anal groove. Values were taken after 2 minutes of stable readings. If the baby had a soiled diaper, the baby was rediapered for ≥ 30 minutes before measures were collected. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured using a VapoMeter (Delfin Technologies, Ltd. Finland) after diaper removal and DD scoring, allowing superficial skin wetness to evaporate prior to measurement. TEWL values were measured on the thigh (control) and in the upper left quadrant of the genitals, avoiding areas of visible skin breakdown. Skin pH was measured using a SkinCheck portable pH meter (Hanna Instruments), and measures were taken on the thigh and upper right quadrant of the genitals to avoid any impact on TEWL measures. Caregivers detailed diapering hygiene practices and skin care treatments via a questionnaire administered onsite, reporting typical behaviors during the previous two weeks.

Demographics, diet, skin cleaning and bathing, topical skin product usage, and diaper hygiene habit data, as well as the relative distribution of DD scores, were summarized with descriptive statistics by country. Genital TEWL data were normalized by subtracting non‐diapered thigh scores. It has been observed that TEWL measurements from babies who are agitated and sweating are unreliable. 18 Thus, infants in the study who had high thigh TEWL scores (the reference site; > 23 g/m²/hour) were excluded from the analysis, resulting in an exclusion of 9% of TEWL measurements for baby ages 2‐8 months. Analysis of variance was used to statistically compare the mean levels of TEWL, pH, and RH between countries.

### The impact of diaper design on mitigating known causes of diaper dermatitis [^113PWz2S]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Disposable diapers represent an essential consumer product in modern life. Diaper technology has advanced considerably and can contribute to improved quality of life by imparting dryness, hygiene, leakage control, and comfort. 1 Diapers are worn in close contact with the skin and, as such, can play a key role in managing skin health. Modern‐day disposable diapers are constructed with absorbency features that lock moisture away from the skin. 2

The absorption and sequestering of fecal matter away from the skin are essential to protecting infant skin health. When in contact with skin, bile salts, fecal enzymes, and other irritants found in stool can begin to break down the protective top layers of skin, which can induce diaper dermatitis. Prolonged stool contact with an infant's skin may also further exacerbate irritation, especially when the outer layers of skin are already compromised. 3

Managing this microenvironment within the diaper by preventing exposure to elements that cause skin breakdowns is essential to reducing the risk of rash and irritation. 4 One of the most important features of a diaper is the topsheet, the part of the diaper in immediate contact with an infant. The topsheet plays a key role in mitigating stool contact with the skin and can play a key role in skin‐related conditions, like diaper dermatitis. Previous research has demonstrated the role that diaper materials have in reducing the incidence of diaper dermatitis. 5 In a retrospective evaluation of clinical trials, the frequency of moderate to severe diaper dermatitis declined by 50% with the introduction of new absorbent materials. 6

Exclusively breastfed infants have stool that is well known to be difficult to contain. 7 Because of the heterogeneous consistency of breastfed infant stool, the stool is often not sufficiently absorbed into the core of the diaper and may be in contact with the skin. Because the stool is not adequately contained, it can leak out of the diaper, where it can increase the risk of skin irritation and dermatitis outside of the diapered region. Compounding this issue, exclusively breastfed infants have a higher median stool frequency per day than infants who are fed formula. 8

Assessment of Diaper Dermatitis

DD, or diaper rash, severity was assessed at 4 diaper grading sites: perianal (anal groove), intertriginous (leg folds), genitals, and buttocks. Diaper rash was graded on post-baseline days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 28. Diaper rash assessment was scored using the P&G Diaper Rash Grading Scale, developed and used by Procter & Gamble, which ranks skin condition on a 7-point scale (0–3.0). Scores are based on the presence and intensity of erythema, erythema area of coverage, and presence of papules and pustules.

Rash assessed at a severity of "mild-to-moderate" (equivalent to a score of ≥ 1.5 on the Diaper Rash Grading Scale) was chosen based on the size of the study and rash incidence and severity observed in this population. Rash was analyzed based on 3 endpoints: (1) the percent of subjects with at least one score ≥ 1.5; (2) the percent of assessments with scores ≥ 1.5; and (3) the percent of subject with consecutive scores ≥ 1.5 at the same site.

Data Analysis and Statistical Methods

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who were randomized and experienced at least one application of the assigned study product. The per protocol (PP) population included subjects in the ITT population who had no serious inclusion/exclusion violations, no serious continuance criteria violations, no serious concomitant medication violations, and high study product compliance. The PP population was used for the primary analysis and for all diaper rash comparisons. Analyses of the ITT population was done to confirm the PP results and as the main data source for adverse event (AE) evaluations and summaries.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study data. Endpoints having to do with the proportion of subjects were analyzed with a χ² test. Endpoints having to do with the proportion of grading sites were analyzed with analysis of variance, where the response is the proportion of graded sites with skin marking score ≥ 2.0 or rash score ≥ 1.5.

### The impact of diaper design on mitigating known causes of diaper dermatitis [^116YuxUf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The frequency and unique consistency of infant stool for exclusively breastfed infants presents specific challenges that traditional diaper offerings may not adequately address, prompting the development of a new diaper offering. A diaper design that can more effectively lock away breastfed infant stool represents a valuable tool that can aid in the mitigation of diaper dermatitis. Presented in this research are two studies that investigated the ability of a diaper with a meshlike aperture topsheet to absorb the stool of breastfed infants. Excerpts of these studies were presented at National Advanced Practice Neonatal Nurses Conference, San Diego, CA, 2016. 7

### Setting the record straight on diaper rash and disposable diapers [^113XwFmE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Skin in the diapered area is continuously threatened by exposure to changes in pH levels, overhydration, mechanical friction, and fecal enzymes, making diaper rash a common occurrence among babies. Up to one third of infants may exhibit clinical symptoms of diaper rash at any time, and more than half of babies between the ages of 4 and 15 months develop diaper rash at least once in a 2-month period. Despite misperceptions that disposable diapers are related to an increase in diaper rash, the incidence of diaper dermatitis is on the decline, largely due to significant improvements in disposable diaper construction and materials. Modern-day disposable diapers are specifically designed to limit exposure to irritants in the diaper area, reduce overhydration, inhibit skin barrier compromise, and help maintain normal skin pH levels and have been thoroughly evaluated for safety and skin compatibility.

### Effects of breathable disposable diapers: reduced prevalence of Candida and common diaper dermatitis [^112B5DQZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Infants wearing breathable disposable diapers experienced significantly less diaper dermatitis (DD) compared to infants wearing standard, nonbreathable disposable diapers in a series of double-blind clinical trials. Severe DD, including confirmed infection with Candida albicans, was reduced by 38–50% among infants wearing highly breathable (HB) diapers. The prevalence of DD was inversely related to the breathability of the garments. The inhibitory effect of breathable diapers on the survival of Candida was further confirmed in controlled experiments with adult volunteers. A suspension of C. albicans cells was applied to delineated sites on the volar forearm. Each site was then covered by a full-thickness patch from either an HB or a standard diaper. Survival of Candida colonies was reduced by almost two-thirds in the breathable diaper-covered sites compared to the control sites.

### The science behind wet wipes for infant skin: ingredient review, safety, and efficacy [^115uWVFx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Skin irritation in the diapered region (commonly referred as diaper dermatitis) is one of the most common skin disorders found in infancy, with the highest incidence at 9‐12 months of age. 1 Overhydration and prolonged exposure to urine and feces are known to be the main contributors to skin irritation in the diapered area. 2 However, an infant's diet, medications, underlying skin conditions, certain product ingredients, caretaker behavior, and practices such as infrequent diaper changes or ineffective cleaning can also influence the occurrence of diaper dermatitis. It has been reported that the diapering process can be a stressful event for an infant. 3 The presence of skin irritation can exacerbate this response, leading to increased pain and discomfort. Ensuring the diapered area is kept dry and clean and that products used do not adversely impact the skin can help minimize the occurrence of dermatitis in the diapered region and, in turn, provide comfort to the infant.

Herein, we provide a review on best practices for ingredients selection, safety, and efficacy of baby wipes to help make more informed decisions when selecting products for infant diapered skin care.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111Xwkaj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis diagnosis and assessment — scope of guideline states that this guideline addresses the diagnosis and assessment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD; atopic eczema) of all severities, and that other forms of dermatitis, such as irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis in those without AD, are outside of the scope of this document. It specifies that this document is the first section in the series and covers methods for diagnosis and monitoring of AD, disease severity and quality of life scales for outcomes measurement, and common clinical associations that affect patients, and notes that a discussion on known risk factors for the development of AD is also presented. It further states that the second guideline in the series will address the management and treatment of AD with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic topical modalities; the third section will cover phototherapy and systemic treatment options; and the fourth section will address the minimization of disease flares, educational interventions, and use of adjunctive approaches.

### Management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients [^111Q71xY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disorder, present in about 12% of children worldwide. Optimizing management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients is critical to reduce signs of inflammation, alleviate pruritus and sleep disturbance, minimize the development and/or impact of comorbidities, and improve the patient and caregiver's quality of life. Evaluating the longitudinal severity of pediatric atopic dermatitis is an important component of measuring therapeutic response and long-term management, and is different in clinical practice versus clinical trials. This article describes when and how to use different treatments for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis, including topical medications, phototherapy, and systemic medical therapies (traditional immunosuppressants, biologics, and small molecule inhibitors). It also provides recommendations useful in clinical practice for nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis.

### Translating atopic dermatitis management guidelines into practice for primary care providers [^114UP3qh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis affects a substantial number of children, many of whom seek initial treatment from their pediatrician or other primary care provider. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have mild disease and can be adequately managed at the primary care level. However, recent treatment guidelines are written primarily for use by specialists and lack certain elements that would make them more useful to primary care providers. This article evaluates these recent treatment guidelines in terms of evaluation criteria, treatment recommendations, usability, accessibility, and applicability to nonspecialists and integrates them with clinical evidence to present a streamlined severity-based treatment model for the management of a majority of atopic dermatitis cases. Because each patient's situation is unique, individualization of treatment plans is critical as is efficient communication and implementation of the plan with patients and caregivers. Specifically, practical suggestions for individualizing, optimizing, implementing, and communicating treatment plans such as choosing a moisturizer formulation, avoiding common triggers, educating patients/caregivers, providing written treatment plans, and scheduling physician follow-up are provided along with a discussion of available resources for patients/caregivers and providers.

### Evaluation of the impact of 2 disposable diapers in the "Natural" diaper category on diapered skin condition [^113UZaAg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Diaper performance was evaluated in a parallel, randomized, examiner-blinded clinical study. The study was reviewed and approved by an ethics committee and all parents/caregivers provided written informed consent for their child. The study randomized 131 infants with 116 completing the study. Participants were stratified by baseline genital diaper rash score, current diaper product used, and sex. Following screening and enrollment, all infants wore a third-party store brand diaper (Parent's Choice) for a 7-day "washout" period to acclimate the skin to the same conditions and were provided a standard, marketed baby wipe (Pampers Sensitive Wipes) to use throughout the study.

Following the washout period, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 diaper products (Diaper A, Honest; Diaper B, Pampers Pure Protection), which were used exclusively for the 4-week study duration. Diaper A was chosen because at the time of the study it was the market leader in the "natural" diaper segment in North America according to sales. Diaper B was a new diaper enhanced with cotton and containing other thoughtfully selected materials.

In-Use Diaper Questionnaire

An at-home diary was used to assess leakage, wear time, and topical product usage. Parents/caregivers were asked to record all diaper changes throughout the study, along with the type of soiling (urine, feces, or both), if there was leakage, and the time between diaper changes. Parents/caregivers were also asked to record and track usage of any topical products (cream, lotion, or powder) throughout the study.

Adverse Events

There were 135 treatment emergent AEs in 76 babies in this study. None of those events were considered serious AEs. Of the nonserious AEs, 101 were mild and 34 were classified as moderate in severity. Of these events, 124 AEs were classified as not related to test product (eg, ear infections, upper respiratory infections, and insect bites). Eleven AEs were classified as doubtful or possible for relatedness, included yeast infection, diaper rash of at least a 2.5, or other marks in the diapered area not classified as diaper rash (6 were on Diaper A and 5 were on Diaper B).

Conclusions

This clinical study comparing 2 diapers in the natural category showed that the new, cotton-enhanced diaper with high-performance materials for absorption outperformed the comparator diaper. As parents and caregivers are increasingly choosing more natural products for their infants, a diaper that combines the ingredients and manufacturing processes they desire, along with outstanding absorption and performance, can meet consumer preferences without sacrificing quality or infant health outcomes.

### The history of diapers and their environmental impact [^112znb44]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Diapers nowadays

For the time being, disposable diapers are essential for baby care almost all around the world. An average child wearing diapers for the first 2.5 years will use between 6000 and 7000 disposable diapers. There have been a number of issues associated with disposable diapers as they have become more prevalent.

Diaper dermatitis is still one of the most common skin disorders affecting between 7 and 35 percent of infants at least once, and it is caused by various factors (chemical, physical, enzymatic, microbiological), not solely diapers. Through good hygiene practices and regular diaper changes, diaper rashes can be reduced, but not eliminated.

At this point in time, diaper disposal has both health and environmental consequences. There is no doubt that disposable diapers contribute significantly to landfill waste. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that single-use diapers are the third most common consumer item in landfills in the United States, and they take 500 years to biodegrade. As a result of these issues, both scientists and diaper companies are working to produce more environmentally friendly diapers.

### Evaluation of the impact of 2 disposable diapers in the "Natural" diaper category on diapered skin condition [^114iWEcL]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The demand for natural infant care products, including diapers, has increased. However, few disposable diapers have been able to provide the performance caregivers desire while also incorporating ingredients consistent with the "natural" category. In an examiner-blinded clinical study, the performance of a new cotton-enhanced diaper with high-performance materials was compared with an existing natural diaper offering. A total of 131 infants wore 1 of the 2 diapers for a 4-week period. Diaper performance was assessed based on skin marking assessments, scored by a trained grader, and incidence of diaper dermatitis. Skin grading for diaper dermatitis was assessed at 4 sites in the diaper area. The new diaper offering was associated with less skin marking and significantly less diaper rash at the genitals and intertriginous regions versus the comparator. These data suggest that the new diaper provided significant improvement in both skin marking and prevalence of diaper rash.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113HZndC]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The miconazole component of VUSION is an antifungal agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. The mechanism of action of white petrolatum and zinc oxide for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The human pharmacodynamics of Vusion is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) for fungal pharmacodynamics].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The topical absorption of miconazole from VUSION was studied in immunocompetent male and female infants and children (n = 17) with diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast) ranging in age from 1 month to 21 months. After multiple daily applications to the affected area at every diaper change (approximately 5–12 times per day) for 7 days, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were below the lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.5 ng/mL in 15 out of 17 (88%) subjects. In the other 2 remaining subjects, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were 0.57 and 0.58 ng/mL, respectively at a single timepoint (4 hours after the last application) on Day 7.

12.4 	Microbiology

The miconazole nitrate component in this product has been shown to have in vitro activity against Candida albicans, an organism that is associated with diaper dermatitis. The activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans is based on the inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis in the cell membrane. The accumulation of ergosterol precursors and toxic peroxides results in cytolysis of the cell. In vitro minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test results for C. albicans isolates obtained from treatment failures in Clinical Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] does not appear to indicate that resistance to miconazole nitrate was the reason for treatment failure. The clinical significance of the in vitro activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans in the setting of diaper dermatitis is unclear.

Introduction

Diapers are an important and necessary product used by the incontinent child. At birth, the diaper is one of the first products worn by the newborn. In the mid-20th century, the predominant diaper was a cotton-containing cloth diaper. Cloth diapers have relatively poor absorbency, especially under high urine and stool loads, leading to diaper leakage. Furthermore, these products were inferior at sequestering urine and feces away from the infant's skin, resulting in skin overhydration and enzymatic attack of the skin by fecal proteases and lipases, as evidenced by severe diaper dermatitis (DD) rates of ~60%. The availability of disposable diapers containing cellulose reduced severe DD rates to ~39%, which was further reduced by superabsorbent diapers (29%), with even lower severe diaper rash observed in present-day diapers with superabsorbent polymers and breathable materials. As such, diaper design plays a crucial role in infant health.

Infant skin is especially susceptible to irritation, particularly in the diapered area where it is in close contact with urine and feces. Irritant DD, also known as diaper rash, is a common skin condition among infants, which is caused by a mix of exposure to friction, excess moisture, and increased pH from urine and feces, and triggers an inflammatory response that is erythematous, papular, scaling, and sometimes painful. - Published data indicate that DD prevalence is estimated to be between 25% and 50%, depending on age and the methods applied in specific studies. Other estimates indicate that approximately 50% to 65% of babies will suffer from diaper rash at some time in their life. The peak incidence of DD is generally believed to occur between the ages of 9 and 12 months.DD is not inconsequential from a health care utilization standpoint, accounting for almost 20% of childhood dermatology visits. The emergence of ultra-absorbent disposable diapers, which better protect against prolonged contact between skin, urine, and feces, has helped improve the care of diapered skin, particularly in reducing the severity and incidence of irritant DD. It is estimated that after the introduction of ultra-absorbent components into the diaper core in the late 1980s, the incidence of moderate to severe DD decreased by 50%; evolving designs continue to improve on the absorption properties of diapers today.

Key Points Irritant contact dermatitis and candida are most common causes. Irritant contact dermatitis typically spares the creases, while Candidafungal infections involve the creases, are beefy red, and may have surrounding papules at the periphery. Consider adding antifungal treatment for ICD when the patient has completed recent antibiotic course or if the rash has persisted longer than 72 hours. Moderate ICD can be treated with low-potency steroids; avoid mid-potency steroids because of increased steroid absorption from diaper occlusion

### Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis… [^1164Eoit]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis are annoying problems that resolve spontaneously in most healthy infants. In some cases, however, the symptoms may be persistent, causing pain, anorexia and discomfort. For these reasons, rapid control is often desirable. Hoppe reviews the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis in neonates and infants. Topical nystatin is virtually free of harmful reactions, although high doses of the oral preparation can cause nausea and vomiting. Nystatin suspension has suboptimal efficacy, because its antifungal activity is only moderate. Amphotericin B suspension appears to have slightly better efficacy than nystatin. Neither gentian violet, nystatin nor amphotericin has a clinical cure rate of greater than 80 percent.

Miconazole gel and topical clotrimazole appear to be more effective, but miconazole oral gel is not available in the United States, and oral clotrimazole can raise liver enzyme levels and cause gastrointestinal side effects in infants. This lack of an efficacious treatment preparation has led to the unconventional oral administration of topical or vaginal antifungal agents. When miconazole is used, it is probably not necessary to administer the medication beyond the day of clinical cure. Candidal diaper rash starts in the perianal area and spreads to adjacent areas. Treatment includes aerating the diaper area and keeping the infant dry. Zinc oxide paste may be soothing and protective when the acute phase of the eruption has subsided. Baby powder application also may be useful. Antifungal therapy is mandatory to achieve resolution. Nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole and clotrimazole are all useful, although cure rates are higher with use of miconazole and clotrimazole.

Oral treatment of candidal diaper dermatitis and the possible accompanying intestinal infection is recommended by many experts. The author concludes that for treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, miconazole oral gel is clearly superior to nystatin suspension. If nystatin suspension must be used, dosages higher than those conventionally administered might improve the outcome. For topical therapy of candidal diaper dermatitis, several agents appear to be equivalent. The addition of an oral agent to the topical treatment is probably appropriate. Nystatin suspension may be used for this purpose.
