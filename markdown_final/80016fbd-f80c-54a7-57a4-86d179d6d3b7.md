## Question

what are plasma markers for bilirubin in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what plasma markers for bilirubin in urine are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic physiology of bilirubin handling and why bilirubin is not normally present in urine. Then, I should verify which bilirubin fractions are actually measured in plasma versus urine and how they differ. Next, I will review what constitutes a "plasma marker" in this context and whether that refers to analytes measured in plasma that correlate with urinary bilirubin. After that, I should examine the clinical scenarios where urinary bilirubin appears and what plasma tests best track those processes. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the physiology, because I need to ensure I'm not overcomplicating this. Unconjugated bilirubin is albumin-bound and water-insoluble, so it is not filtered by the glomerulus and should not appear in urine, whereas conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and can be filtered and excreted when present in plasma at sufficient concentrations, which is why urinary bilirubin signals conjugated hyperbilirubinemia rather than unconjugated disease.

> Wait, let me verify the terminology so I don't misstate it. In clinical practice, we measure total bilirubin in plasma/serum and then fractionate it into direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) components; urinary bilirubin assays detect conjugated bilirubin, not unconjugated, so the "plasma marker" that corresponds to urinary bilirubin is the conjugated (direct) bilirubin fraction in serum or plasma, not total bilirubin alone [^5b449e9b] [^8201f123].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what counts as a "marker". I initially thought "plasma markers for bilirubin in urine" might mean separate urinary analytes like bilirubin oxidative metabolites, but that would conflate urine analytes with plasma markers; the correct interpretation is that the plasma marker that tracks urinary bilirubin is conjugated bilirubin itself, since urinary bilirubin reflects increased plasma conjugated bilirubin due to hepatocellular disease or cholestasis, not unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome [^5d6ad67a].

> I should double-check the clinical contexts where urinary bilirubin appears, because that will anchor which plasma test to order. Urinary bilirubin is detected when there is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia from hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or biliary obstruction; in these settings, plasma direct bilirubin is elevated and correlates with the presence of urinary bilirubin, whereas isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (hemolysis, Gilbert) does not produce urinary bilirubin and thus the direct fraction is normal or only mildly elevated relative to total bilirubin [^5b449e9b] [^8201f123].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at the bench. If urinary bilirubin is positive on dipstick, I need to check a fractionated serum bilirubin and liver enzymes to confirm conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and evaluate for hepatobiliary disease; if the direct fraction is not elevated, I should reconsider the urinalysis result as a false positive or look for alternative explanations, and if the direct fraction is elevated, I should proceed with imaging and targeted labs to distinguish hepatocellular from cholestatic or obstructive etiologies [^5b449e9b] [^5794d13f].

> But wait, what if someone is asking about special urine analytes that relate to bilirubin metabolism rather than bilirubin itself. Bilirubin oxidative metabolites in urine have been studied as markers of oxidative stress in sepsis and correlate with inflammation, yet these are distinct urinary biomarkers and are not the standard clinical correlate of urinary bilirubin; they do not replace the need to measure plasma conjugated bilirubin when urinary bilirubin is detected [^6df4ef34].

> Let me reconsider the neonatal angle briefly, because I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. In infants, prolonged jaundice warrants measuring total and direct serum bilirubin to detect cholestasis, and the presence of conjugated bilirubin in serum would be the plasma marker that, if elevated, would also be expected to appear in urine; thus, the same principle applies: direct bilirubin in plasma is the marker that corresponds to urinary bilirubin when present [^f13163de] [^396e2b42].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. The plasma marker for bilirubin in urine is conjugated (direct) bilirubin measured in serum or plasma; when urinary bilirubin is present, it reflects increased plasma conjugated bilirubin due to hepatocellular or cholestatic processes, and the appropriate clinical response is to obtain fractionated serum bilirubin with liver enzymes and proceed to hepatobiliary evaluation as indicated [^5b449e9b] [^8201f123].

---

The plasma marker for bilirubin in urine is **conjugated (direct) bilirubin** [^5b449e9b], which is water-soluble and filtered by the kidneys when present in plasma at elevated levels [^376f0048]. Unconjugated bilirubin is albumin-bound and not filtered, so it does not appear in urine. Urine bilirubin is typically detected by dipstick or laboratory assays [^5d6ad67a] and indicates **hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis** [^8201f123] when conjugated bilirubin is elevated in plasma [^5794d13f]. Persistent urine bilirubin warrants evaluation with fractionated serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, and imaging to determine the cause [^5794d13f].

---

## Physiological basis of bilirubin in plasma and urine

Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced during heme breakdown; it circulates in two forms: **unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin**, which is water-insoluble and albumin-bound, and **conjugated (direct) bilirubin**, which is water-soluble and excreted into bile [^376f0048]. Unconjugated bilirubin is not filtered by the kidneys and therefore does not appear in urine, whereas conjugated bilirubin is filtered and excreted when plasma levels are elevated [^1cfe508a].

---

## Plasma markers of bilirubin in urine

The primary plasma marker of bilirubin in urine is **conjugated bilirubin**. Elevated plasma conjugated bilirubin indicates hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis and leads to urinary excretion [^8201f123].

---

## Clinical significance of bilirubin in urine

The presence of bilirubin in urine (**bilirubinuria**) is abnormal and indicates elevated plasma conjugated bilirubin [^5b449e9b]. It is clinically significant and suggests hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis [^8201f123].

---

## Conditions associated with elevated plasma conjugated bilirubin and bilirubinuria

Several conditions cause elevated plasma conjugated bilirubin and bilirubinuria, including:

- **Hepatocellular injury**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure [^5794d13f].
- **Cholestasis**: Biliary obstruction, gallstones, tumors, and strictures [^8201f123].
- **Inherited disorders**: Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes [^d34d0de0].
- **Drug-induced cholestasis**: Certain medications impair bile flow [^9ab610ef].

---

## Laboratory methods for detecting bilirubin in urine

Bilirubin in urine is detected by:

- **Dipstick tests**: Rapid, semi-quantitative screening for urinary bilirubin [^5d6ad67a].
- **Laboratory assays**: Quantitative methods (e.g. diazo reaction) for accurate measurement [^1243932b].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Bilirubinuria warrants **further evaluation** to identify the underlying cause:

- **Fractionated serum bilirubin**: Differentiate conjugated vs unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^5b449e9b].
- **Liver enzymes**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT to assess liver injury or cholestasis [^5794d13f].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT to evaluate biliary obstruction or liver disease [^5794d13f].

---

## Limitations and considerations

False positives and negatives can occur with urine bilirubin tests; **confirmatory testing** is recommended [^5d6ad67a]. Interpretation should consider patient factors such as hydration, medications, and comorbidities [^notfound].

---

The plasma marker for bilirubin in urine is **conjugated bilirubin**; its presence indicates hepatobiliary disease or cholestasis and requires further evaluation [^8201f123].

### Circulating total bilirubin and future risk of hypertension in the general population: the prevention of renal and vascular end-stage disease (PREVEND) prospective study and a mendelian randomization approach [^ffdc774d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Skewed variables (eg, total bilirubin and hsCRP) were natural log‐transformed to achieve approximately normal distributions. Descriptive analyses were preformed to summarize baseline characteristics of participants. We assessed cross‐sectional associations of total bilirubin levels with risk markers for hypertension by calculating partial correlation coefficients adjusted for age and sex. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between total bilirubin and incident hypertension risk after confirmation of no major departure from the proportionality of hazards assumptions using Schoenfeld residuals. 33 To characterize the shape of the association between total bilirubin and hypertension risk, hazard ratios estimated within quartiles of baseline total bilirubin levels relative to the bottom quartile were plotted against mean log e total bilirubin levels in each quartile using floating absolute risks, 34 details of which have been described previously. 35 Subsidiary analyses involved fitting multivariate‐adjusted fractional polynomial models. Total bilirubin was modeled as both continuous (per 1‐SD higher log e total bilirubin levels) and categorical (quartiles defined according to the baseline distribution of total bilirubin level) variables. The SD of baseline log e total bilirubin level was 0.43 (equivalent to 1.5‐fold higher circulating total bilirubin level, as e^(0.43) = 1.54). Hazard ratios were progressively adjusted for (1) age and sex; (2) other established risk factors for hypertension (smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, SBP, total cholesterol, body mass index, parental history of hypertension, alcohol consumption, and estimated glomerular filtration rate); (3) other potential confounders (urinary albumin excretion and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance); and (4) hsCRP. Selection of these confounders were based on their previously established role as risk factors for hypertension, evidence from previous research, or their potential as confounders based on known associations with the outcome of hypertension and observed associations with plasma total bilirubin using the available data. We used formal tests of interaction tests to assess statistical evidence of effect modification by individual characteristics, such as age, sex, and other risk markers for hypertension. To avoid potential bias attributed to reverse causation, we carried out sensitivity analyses that excluded participants with a history of diabetes mellitus at baseline, the first 2 years of follow‐up, or participants on regular statin medication, or participants with potential Gilbert's syndrome. 1 We also utilized the use of complex survey design analyses, 36 taking into account that the PREVEND cohort is oversampled for subjects with higher albuminuria levels, which enables the results to be extrapolated to the general population. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software (version 14; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). The associations of rs6742078 were queried with SBP and DBP using data from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure and with SBP, DBP, and hypertension using data from the BPExome consortium. 37

### Biomarkers in sepsis [^6f6b7c38]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ORGAN DYSFUNCTION

A systemic inflammatory response to infection (sepsis) can lead on to multiple organ dysfunction (severe sepsis). At present, the tools available for clinicians to diagnose organ dysfunction are limited in their capacity to detect early change. Renal dysfunction is currently diagnosed by a fall in urine output and a rise in serum urea and creatinine. However, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response to hypovolaemia whereas, in patients with previously normal kidneys, creatinine does not rise above normal values until the glomerular filtration rate has fallen by approximately 75%. A vast array of blood and urine biomarkers, of which more than 30 are currently described, can detect decreases in renal function (e.g. cystatin C) or direct tubular stress or injury [e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)] at a much earlier stage. In addition, biomarkers can be used to predict renal recovery. At present, it is unclear which biomarkers best prognosticate for significant renal dysfunction and injury, and which can be successfully used to direct therapy to prevent (or at least ameliorate) acute kidney injury.

The same applies to the liver where traditional markers of dysfunction such as hyperbilirubinaemia and coagulopathy occur relatively late, peaking at 3–5 days after the diagnosis of sepsis. However, we have recently shown impaired biotransformation and hepatobiliary transport in a rat model as early as 6 h after faecal peritoneal contamination. This early dysfunction is supported by a significant rise in plasma bile acids in 48 patients on the day severe sepsis was diagnosed; unlike bilirubin (AUC 0.59), bile acid levels predicted 28-day mortality with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC up to 0.87).

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the current study include the large, population‐based cohort, which was representative of the general population; exclusion of hypertensive individuals at baseline as well as those with pre‐existing diseases, such as CVD, renal disease, or malignancy, which minimized any possibilities of reverse‐causation bias; comprehensive data on lifestyle and biochemical factors, which allowed control for potential confounders; comprehensive analysis, such as evaluating the shape of the association and effect modification by clinically relevant characteristics; and robustness of the findings in several sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we have utilized an MR approach using summarized large‐scale published data to assess the associations of a specific genetic variant for circulating bilirubin with blood pressure. A number of limitations should also be considered when interpreting these results. First, because our data were observational, residual confounding attributed to errors in risk marker measurements and unmeasured confounders remains an alternative explanation. Second, absence of repeat measurements of total bilirubin precluded the ability to correct for within‐person variability in plasma total bilirubin levels and this could have underestimated the associations, as a result of regression dilution given the long‐term follow‐up of the cohort. 67, 68 Circulating bilirubin has been shown to exhibit high within‐person variability, 69 hence the associations demonstrated may even be stronger. Larger‐scale prospective studies with repeat measurements of circulating total bilirubin are needed to reliably assess the magnitude of the associations. Third, measurements of total bilirubin in the PREVEND study involved prolonged plasma storage, which could have contributed to the modest effect of total bilirubin on hypertension risk. Fourth, we assessed bilirubin concentrations in the fasting state, when the levels are highest. Because we had no data on nonfasting bilirubin concentrations, we were unable to investigate its concentrations in the nonfasting state and how these concentrations affect hypertension. Fifth, the current analysis involved principally white‐European participants, which hampers the generalization of our findings. Finally, our MR approach was based on published publicly available data, which precluded the ability to fully assess instrumental variable assumptions. Given the unavailability of interventions that specifically influence levels of bilirubin alone 70 and can be safely administered to large numbers of subjects for a prolonged period, causal inferences using randomized trials of interventions that modify bilirubin levels are not feasible in the short term. Further MR studies using large‐scale, individual‐level data may help to establish or rule out causality.

Biological samples and safety monitoring

At each follow-up visit, blood and urine samples are sent to the local hospital laboratory for creatinine, electrolytes, liver function tests (bilirubin, alanine or aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase) and uACR. In addition, at the 3-, 6- and 12-month visits, samples are also taken for central analysis. EDTA samples are centrifuged and the plasma aliquoted into Cryovials, which are stored locally (with Cryovials of urine) at or below −20°C prior to transfer to the central laboratory in Oxford, UK, where they are stored at −80°C. The main plasma analytes measured at the central laboratory are creatinine, cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and the urine analytes include albumin and markers of tubular damage and function [including kidney injury molecule 1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, β2-microglobulin and retinol binding protein; Table 1]. Participants are asked not to take their morning dose of study treatment on the day of their 3-month visit (at this visit only) and the date and time of the last dose is recorded, as these samples are to be used for pharmacokinetic analyses.

The results of local samples are entered into the trial database once available and reviewed daily by a trained clinician at the coordinating centre. If the potassium is > 5.5 mmol/L, alanine or aspartate transaminase > 2× the upper limit of normal or if the eGFR has fallen > 25% from the previous value, then the trial protocol provides advice on further tests and study treatment (see Supplementary data).

Monitoring

Prior to starting recruitment, study staff received training in the study procedures and the web-based data collection system at the coordinating centre. Recruitment rates, adherence to trial procedures and completeness of follow-up data are monitored closely by staff at the coordinating centre. All sites have at least one on-site monitoring visit, with further visits as indicated by the results of central monitoring of the data. An independent data monitoring committee (see Supplementary data) regularly reviews unblinded interim analyses of all relevant data.

### Circulating total bilirubin and future risk of hypertension in the general population: the prevention of renal and vascular end-stage disease (PREVEND) prospective study and a mendelian randomization approach [^f827812e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Circulating total bilirubin is known to be inversely and independently associated with future risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship of circulating total bilirubin with incident hypertension is uncertain. We aimed to assess the association of total bilirubin with future hypertension risk and supplemented this with a Mendelian randomization approach to investigate any causal relevance to the association.

Methods and Results

Plasma total bilirubin levels were measured at baseline in the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease) prospective study of 3989 men and women without hypertension. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of total bilirubin with incident hypertension were assessed. New-onset hypertension was recorded in 1206 participants during a median follow-up of 10.7 years. Baseline total bilirubin was approximately log-linearly associated with hypertension risk. Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for hypertension per 1-SD increase in log e total bilirubin was 0.86 (0.81–0.92; P < 0.001), which was attenuated to 0.94 (0.88–0.99; P = 0.040) after further adjustment for established risk factors and other potential confounders. The association was marginally significant on further adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (0.94; 0.88–1.00; P = 0.067). A genetic variant at the UGT1A1*28 locus consistently shown to be strongly associated with circulating bilirubin levels-rs6742078-was not significantly associated with blood pressure or hypertension (P > 0.05 for all), arguing against a strong causal association of circulating bilirubin with blood pressure.

Conclusions

The weak and inverse association of circulating total bilirubin with future hypertension risk may be driven by biases such as unmeasured confounding and/or reverse causation. Further evaluation is warranted.

### A fluorescence-based quantitative analysis for total bilirubin in blood and urine [^1243932b]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a catabolic product of heme metabolism that circulates in the bloodstream in its unconjugated or glucuronide-conjugated form. Because the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood is a common symptom of liver diseases, its measurement in plasma (serum) is important for the diagnosis of these diseases.

Method

We developed a method to assess total bilirubin levels in serum and urine, using the fluorescent protein UnaG and β-glucuronidase.

Results

Our results indicate good correlation in serum total bilirubin levels between UnaG and the conventional bilirubin oxidase (BOD) methods. We found low levels of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in the urine of healthy subject individuals. Urinary bilirubin levels were elevated in patients with liver or bile duct diseases. A simple spot test of bilirubin using serum and urine showed a strong signal in patients with liver diseases.

Conclusion

The proposed method to assess bilirubin levels in serum and urine will contribute to the accurate diagnosis of health conditions such as jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^0d23d712]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Reduced eGFR and abnormal proteinuria have been associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. Because renal disease often progresses to ESRD, the identification of risk factors for kidney disease progression is essential.

Increased concentrations of serum bilirubin have long been used as a marker of liver dysfunction. In addition, serum bilirubin is not merely an end product of heme degradation but is also a potent antioxidant that acts via inhibitions of NADPH oxidase, a key source of oxidants in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, and of protein kinase C activity.

Information on the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with renal function and proteinuria is limited and controversial. Fukui et al. found that total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with albuminuria in a hospital-based sample of 633 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, indicating that bilirubin has a potential renoprotective effect. In contrast, Targher et al. found that a higher total serum bilirubin was significantly associated with lower eGFR in both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals in a group of 2678 unselected outpatients 35 years of age or older.

To date, the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with kidney function and proteinuria have not been established in a Korean adult population. Therefore, we examined the associations among serum bilirubin concentration, eGFR and the degree of 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^e7644793]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The significant associations between total serum bilirubin and eGFR or albuminuria observed in diabetic individuals of our cohort were the same as those from Fukui et al. That previous study found that total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with albuminuria in a hospital-based sample of 633 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (mean age: 64.4 ± 11.5 years; 52% male). However, in that study, no adjustment was made for important confounders, such as eGFR. In our study, a positive correlation was found between total serum bilirubin concentration and eGFR in all subjects as well as in diabetic patients.

Based on in vitro as well as animal studies, bilirubin is generally recognized as an important antioxidant substance. Kumar et al. demonstrated that serum bilirubin concentration is inversely correlated with a marker of oxidative stress and is positively correlated with antioxidative enzyme activities such as those of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These results are also supported by clinical studies focused on the protective effects of serum bilirubin concentration on atherosclerosis. In this study, serum bilirubin concentration correlated negatively with proteinuria and positively correlated with renal function, and total cholesterol in the normal proteinuria group level was lower than that in the abnormal proteinuria group. However, we were unable to assess the antioxidant effect of serum bilirubin, because tests for an oxidative stress marker and antioxidant enzyme were not carried out.

In addition to being an antioxidant, bilirubin also has anticomplement properties that protect against inflammation. Furthermore, bilirubin has been suggested to have cytoprotective properties through its influence on protein kinase C. Through these mechanisms, bilirubin could protect diabetic patients from the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, in this study, the 24-hour proteinuria level in the diabetic group was lower than that in the non-diabetic group because CKD patients were included in the non-diabetic group.

In results of this study, we might think serum bilirubin concentration may be utilized as a provisional new risk factor of diabetic nephropathy that can be measured easily in the clinical laboratory and applied in medical practice.

It could be hypothesized that the bilirubin-kidney dysfunction relationship primarily reflects the association of serum bilirubin concentration with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD represents the most common cause of mild to moderate increases in serum bilirubin and other liver enzymes in Western countries. Recent studies have found that NAFLD is independently associated with an increased incidence of CKD in both non-diabetic and diabetic populations.

### Common variants in the SLCO1B3 locus are associated with bilirubin levels and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^c4a08bb8]. Human Molecular Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, resulting largely from the turnover of hemoglobin, is found in the plasma in two main forms: unconjugated or conjugated with glucuronic acid. Unconjugated bilirubin is transported into hepatocytes. There, it is glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and secreted into the bile canaliculi. We report a genome wide association scan in 4300 Sardinian individuals for total serum bilirubin levels. In addition to the two known loci previously involved in the regulation of bilirubin levels, UGT1A1 (P = 6.2 x 10(-62)) and G6PD (P = 2.5 x 10(-8)), we observed a strong association on chromosome 12 within the SLCO1B3 gene (P = 3.9 x 10(-9)). Our findings were replicated in an independent sample of 1860 Sardinians and in 832 subjects from the Old Order Amish (combined P < 5 x 10(-14)). We also show that SLC01B3 variants contribute to idiopathic mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Thus, SLC01B3 appears to be involved in the regulation of serum bilirubin levels in healthy individuals and in some bilirubin-related disorders that are only partially explained by other known gene variants.

### Circulating total bilirubin and risk of incident cardiovascular disease in the general population [^b4604f18]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of circulating total bilirubin and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a new prospective study and to determine whether adding information on total bilirubin values to established cardiovascular risk factors is associated with improvement in prediction of CVD risk.

Approach and Results

Circulating total bilirubin levels were measured at baseline in the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) prospective study of 7222 participants and 773 incident CVD events. Total bilirubin was log-linearly associated with CVD risk. Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for CVD per 1-SD increase in loge total bilirubin was 0.82 (0.76 to 0.88; P < 0.001), which was minimally attenuated to 0.89 (0.82 to 0.96; P = 0.003) after further adjustment for established risk factors. In a meta-analysis of 12 population-based prospective studies involving 9378 incident CVD cases, the pooled multivariate-adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for CVD was 0.93 (0.90 to 0.97; P < 0.001) per 1-SD increase in total bilirubin levels. The corresponding pooled risks for coronary heart disease and stroke were 0.95 (0.92 to 0.99; P = 0.018) and 0.93 (0.88 to 0.98; P = 0.006), respectively. Addition of information on total bilirubin to a CVD risk prediction model containing established risk factors was associated with a C-index change of 0.0013 (-0.0004 to 0.0029; P = 0.13).

Conclusions

There is a log-linear inverse association between circulating total bilirubin level and CVD risk, which is independent of established risk factors. Nonetheless, inclusion of total bilirubin in the standard established risk factors panel provides no significant improvement in CVD risk prediction.

### Critical care hepatology: definitions, incidence, prognosis and role of liver failure in critically ill patients [^a88fc049]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic clinical features

Serum bilirubin is a stable and prevailing marker of liver impairment in the ICU. Its concentration is influenced by bilirubin synthesis, transport, uptake, conjugation and excretion. Ischemic and sepsis-associated cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury and parenteral nutrition are predominant causes of hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU. Bilirubin is a marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor. It has been shown to be linked to infections in surgical patients, to an increased mortality among trauma patients, sepsis or hematological malignancies, to a poor prognosis among ARDS patients, or simply to a worse outcome in the ICU (summarized in Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of the incidence and the overall mortality associated with increased bilirubin in ICU patients as reported in the literature

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, N.d not documented, TA transaminases, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CA cardiac arrest

*Increase of 2 mg/dl from baseline

OR for complications, not for mortality

*Within the first 2 days after ICU admission

OR for unfavorable neurological outcome, not for mortality

In the case of cholestasis, total bile acids are also an independent prognostic factor of disease severity. An elevation of 5.2 µmol/l of total bile acids from baseline data demonstrated discriminating value, while mortality was specifically augmented with increases > 10 µmol/l. Horvatits et al. suggested that bile acids could be a better prognostic factor than bilirubin in the ICU. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the elevation of bile acids in critically ill patients is a distinct pathophysiological entity or a compensatory mechanism.

Regarding hypoxic liver injury, the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is an effective tool for assessing liver function. In an observational study with 97 patients, a cutoff value of 9% 48 h after ICU admission demonstrated a significant prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality. In contrast, bilirubin, due to the later peak time, might not be a reliable marker and is elevated in only one-third of patients with hypoxic liver injury. The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate outperforms bilirubin as a more sensitive combined indicator of perfusion and excretory liver function in the ICU.

Finally, underlying and concomitant syndromes will impact the outcome, such as sepsis or need for organ support. Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients with hypoxic liver injury. As expected, the severity of organ failure results in higher mortality rates.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^316990e9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### Cholestatic liver (dys) function during sepsis and other critical illnesses [^100cdb86]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

In ICU patients, abnormal liver tests are common. Markers of cholestasis are associated with adverse outcome. Research has focused on the possibility that mild hyperbilirubinemia, instead of indicating inadvertent cholestasis, may be adaptive and beneficial. These new insights are reviewed and integrated in the state-of-the-art knowledge on hepatobiliary alterations during sepsis and other critical illnesses.

Data Sources

Relevant publications were searched in Medline with search terms bile, bile acids, cholestasis, critical illness, intensive care, sepsis, alone or in combination.

Data Synthesis

Studies have shown that bilirubin, but also bile acids, the main active constitutes of bile, are increased in plasma of patients with critical illnesses. In particular the conjugated fractions of bilirubin and bile acids are high, indicating that during critical illness the liver is capable of converting these molecules to less toxic forms. In human liver biopsies of prolonged critically ill patients, expression of bile acid excretion pumps towards the bile canaliculi was lower, while alternative transporters towards the systemic circulation were upregulated. Remarkably, in the presence of increased circulating bile acids, expression of enzymes controlling synthesis of bile acids was not suppressed. This suggested loss of feedback inhibition of bile acids synthesis, possibly explained by the observed cytoplasmic retention of the nuclear FXR/RXR heterodimer. As macronutrient restriction during acute critical illness, an intervention that improved outcome, was found to further increase plasma bilirubin while reducing other markers of cholestasis, a potentially protective role of hyperbilirubinemia was suggested.

Conclusion

The increase in circulating levels of conjugated bile acids and bilirubin in response to acute sepsis/critical illnesses may not necessarily point to cholestasis as a pathophysiological entity. Instead it may be the result of an adaptively altered bile acid production and transport back towards the systemic circulation. How these changes could be beneficial for survival should be further investigated.

### Relationship between serum bilirubin concentrations and diabetic nephropathy in shanghai han's patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^54947936]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Although several studies have been performed, the exact mechanism underlying the negative association between high bilirubin concentrations and the progression of T1DM remains unknown. A previous study demonstrated that diabetic hyperbilirubinemic Gunn j/j rats with high concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma excreted significantly less urinary albumin than diabetic non-hyperbilirubinemic Gunn j/+ rats, and that administration of biliverdin (5 mg/kg) protected against both albuminuria and renal mesangial expansion in db/db mice. The same authors subsequently discovered that treatment with bilirubin and biliverdin completely inhibited oxidative stress-induced increased expression of NOX4 mRNA and protein levels of cultured vascular endothelial and mesangial cells. These findings suggest that bilirubin and biliverdin significantly inhibit NADPH-dependent superoxide production. A study using an isolated, perfused rat kidney model demonstrated that micromolar dose administration of exogenous bilirubin resulted in significantly improved renal vascular resistance, urine output, glomerular filtration rate, tubular function, and mitochondrial integrity after ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and showed that bilirubin pretreatment may have future clinical applications, particularly in IRI after organ transplantation. Furthermore, studies on diabetic rats have shown that exogenously administered CO or bilirubin can protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress-mediated injury. A study on hyperbilirubinemia caused by atazanavir treatment in 16 subjects with T2DM indicated that hyperbilirubinemia is associated with a significant improvement in endothelial function. Considering that oxidative stress, described as increased levels of reactive oxygen species, may be a common pathway linking diverse mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of complications in diabetes and that hyperglycemia-induced increases in blood pressure and changes in endothelial cells are reversed by antioxidants, high concentrations of bilirubin in serum may potentially serve as protective factors against the development of DN through their antioxidative properties.

This study had several limitations. First, only total bilirubin concentrations in serum were measured, without distinguishing between conjugated versus unconjugated bilirubin. Second, this was a single-center, cross-sectional study, which prevented us from drawing conclusions regarding the temporal nature of the observed association between bilirubin concentrations and the prevalence of DN in Chinese patients with T1DM. Third, the study population consisted of Chinese males and females and whether our findings apply to other ethnic groups remains unclear.

### How to use donath-landsteiner test to diagnose paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) [^bd412416]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

What initial laboratory tests may be useful in aiding a diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and what might you expect from these investigations?

A haemolytic screen should be carried out and its result interpreted collectively: full blood count (FBC) and film, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), split bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), reticulocytes, haptoglobin and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy). Typical findings and limitations in interpretation are noted in figure 7. Laboratory results in extravascular haemolysis are generally less severe, as haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, with fewer degradation products released into the circulation.

Figure 7
Comparison between the typical laboratory findings in an extravascular versus an intravascular haemolysis. Note: Haptoglobin is not produced efficiently in children under 2 years or those with liver disease (levels are artificially low) and rises with acute inflammation, so it may be misleadingly normal in infection/inflammation despite haemolysis. LDH is non-specifically elevated in tissue damage and may remain low in extravascular haemolysis as red cells are mopped up by the reticuloendothelial system. Reticulocytes may be depressed initially because infection is often myelosuppressive and then rebound. ↑↑, significantly increased; ↑, increased; ↓, decreased; ↓↓, significantly decreased; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

Haemolysis causes anaemia if the bone marrow RBC production cannot compensate for increased RBC destruction. Haemoglobinuria should be suspected if the urine dipstick is positive for blood but urine microscopy shows minimal red cells. Haptoglobin, the most sensitive laboratory indicator of haemolysis and last marker to normalise, is significantly decreased due to free haemoglobin (Hb) exceeding the Hb-binding capacity of the circulating haptoglobins. A reticulocytosis is usually seen, although with AIHA reticulocytopenia can commonly occur in the acute phase due to myelosuppression secondary to a recent infection or inadequate compensatory reticulocytosis. The patient's blood results are shown in figure 1.

### Increased urinary excretion of bilirubin oxidative metabolites in septic patients: a new marker for oxidative stress in vivo [^6df4ef34]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bilirubin oxidative metabolites (BOMs) are generated from bilirubin as a result of its scavenging action against free radicals. During sepsis, excess amounts of free radicals are produced, and they play an important role in the pathophysiological process. We studied whether urinary excretion of BOMs would increase under septic conditions in humans and compared BOM levels with other well-established clinical parameters of inflammation.

Methods

In 19 septic patients and 28 nonseptic control patients, the BOM concentrations in urine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with an anti-bilirubin antibody.

Results

Urinary BOM levels in septic patients were much higher than those in control patients (21.6 ± 2.5 vs 1.4 ± 0.4 micromol/g creatinine, P < 0.001). Although there was a linear correlation between urinary BOM and serum total bilirubin levels (r = 0.392, P = 0.008), serum bilirubin levels were not significantly higher in the septic group than in the control group (P = 0.072). BOM levels correlated with body temperature (r = 0.801, P < 0.001), white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood (r = 0.590, P < 0.001), serum C-reactive protein (r = 0.653, P < 0.001), and the acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score (r = 0.467, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

These results demonstrated a urinary increase in BOMs in septic patients. This increase indicates that urinary BOM level is a possible marker for continuous monitoring of sepsis severity in clinical practice.

### The role of previously unmeasured organic acids in the pathogenesis of severe malaria [^2a32c38e]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Plasma β-HBA concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria. Patients with sepsis had the highest relative and absolute concentrations of β-HBA in both plasma and urine. Levels of α-HBA in patients with severe malaria, sepsis or encephalopathy were higher than in those with uncomplicated malaria, but α-HBA levels were not distinguishable between patients with severe malaria and the reference groups. Corrected α-HBA urine concentrations were higher in patients with severe malaria than in patients with uncomplicated malaria.

Among participants with a positive SIG, the median total proportion of SIG that could be explained by HPLA, α-HBA and β-HBA was 3.4% in patients with severe malaria (interquartile range [IQR] 2.1–7.0), compared with 4.2% in patients with bacterial sepsis (IQR 2.0–15.6). The median proportion of SIG attributable to HPLA alone was 0.13% in severe malaria (IQR 0.09–0.21), and 0.08% in sepsis (IQR 0.04–0.18); these contributions were significantly different (P = 0.018).

Plasma creatinine was correlated with HPLA (r = 0.68; P < 0.001) and β-HBA (r = 0.21; P = 0.016). Weaker correlations were seen between bilirubin and all four acids and between the parasite biomass marker Pf HRP2 and all four acids. GCS score correlated inversely with all four acids. The complete correlation matrix is provided in Additional file 1: Table S1.

### Cholestatic alterations in the critically ill: some new light on an old problem [^3b20fd76]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Liver dysfunction and jaundice are traditionally viewed as late features of sepsis and other critical illnesses and are associated with a complicated ICU stay. However, study results suggest that cholestatic alterations occur early in the course of critical illnesses, perceived only as minor abnormalities in routinely used biochemical liver tests. Inflammation-induced alterations in the transport of bile acids (BAs) appear to drive BAs and bilirubin toward the systemic circulation. Ongoing BA synthesis with an, at least partial, loss of feedback inhibition further contributes to elevated circulating BAs and bilirubin. To what extent these changes reflect a biochemical epiphenomenon, true illness-induced liver dysfunction, or a beneficial and adaptive response to illness should be investigated further. Because of the lack of specificity of standard laboratory tests, especially in the context of a complex systemic condition such as critical illness, identifying true cholestatic liver dysfunction remains a great challenge. However, high levels of cholestatic markers that are sustained in patients with prolonged critical illness almost always indicate a complicated illness course and should be monitored closely. Preventing cholestatic liver dysfunction comprises minimizing inflammation and hypoxia in the liver and preventing hyperglycemia, avoiding early use of parenteral nutrition, and reducing the administration of avoidable drugs. Future research on the effects of BAs and on modulating underlying drivers of cholestasis induced by critical illness is warranted as this could open perspectives for a targeted diagnostic approach and ultimately for novel therapies to improve outcome.

### Are unexpected positive dipstick urine bilirubin results clinically significant? A retrospective review [^5d6ad67a]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urine-bilirubin measurement is common in urinalysis dipsticks, which are known to yield a high rate of false positive results. We evaluated the usefulness of this test after multiple physicians in our system reported that they do not act on positive dipstick urine bilirubin findings.

Methods

We queried past records to determine how many samples with positive urine bilirubin results had associated abnormal results for liver function tests (LFTs) within 2 weeks before the positive urine bilirubin result. (LFTs included aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and total bilirubin.) We labeled positive results on these test as expected positives. We labeled the positive test results for samples from patients who had not had abnormal LFT results within 2 weeks before the current testing as unexpected positives.

Results

During a 20-month period, we performed 241,929 urine-bilirubin tests. Of these, 831 (0.3%) yielded positive results. Of these positives, 60% were from patients who had abnormal LFT results in the previous 2 weeks. The remaining 40% of positive results were deemed to be unexpected positives. Of these, 80% had had LFTs ordered within 2 weeks after the positive urine bilirubin results. A total of 85% of those LFTs yielded an abnormal result.

Conclusion

In patients with an unexpected positive urine bilirubin test result, 85% had abnormal LFT results after their positive urine bilirubin result. However, these unexpected positives amounted to only 0.13% of all test results. Urine bilirubin does not appear to add significant information toward the diagnosis of most patients.

In this review the historical tenets and evidence-based clinical research in support of a bilirubin exchange threshold of > 20 mg/dL for the healthy term neonate are revisited. In addition, a hypothesis is ventured that recent cases of kernicterus are related in part to changes in population factors coupled with genetic predispositions that have unmasked an unappreciated potential for marked neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^d2281618]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the largest single cohort study of all liver biochemistry parameters (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, bilirubin, and albumin) within the normal range, we show in treated hypertensive patients that the tests comprising the standard liver biochemistry panel have characteristic-independent effects on mortality, follow-up BP and a modest improvement in cardiovascular mortality prediction. Our findings are complementary to a recent large meta-analysis of liver enzymes mainly in the general population (GGT, ALP, ALT, and AST) from Kunutsor et al, who showed a log-linear relationship between GGT and ALP with CVD risk and variable association between ALT and CVD end points. We show a negative association with mortality and longitudinal BP for serum bilirubin and ALT, but a positive association for GGT and ALP. Indeed higher baseline ALP and GGT showed a consistent relationship with higher follow-up SBP. Serum bilirubin and other liver function markers offered modest predictive utility (primarily for continuous NRI) over standard clinical risk factors in hypertensive patients.

Bilirubin and ALT show similar associations with mortality and longitudinal BP, but the mechanisms are likely to be different. Bilirubin levels are strongly determined by genetic and environmental influences. The protective effect of bilirubin is supported by data that UGT1A1 genetic variants underlying Gilbert's syndrome are also protective against CVD. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of bilirubin may partially explain the biological mechanisms associated with this negative relationship.

In our study, higher bilirubin is associated with a lower baseline BP and greater longitudinal reduction in BP, which suggest that the protective effect of bilirubin can be partly explained by BP effects. For example, each μmol/L increase in serum bilirubin decreased the SBP by 0.13 mm Hg. There is considerable physiological evidence showing increases in bilirubin affects renal hemodynamics and thus can decrease BP. For example, increases in bilirubin protect against excessive tubuloglomerular feedback–mediated afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and can attenuate constriction to high levels of vasoconstrictors, such as Ang II. Moreover, bilirubin is one of the most potent antioxidants in the body, and Ang II–mediated superoxide production is significantly attenuated in aortic ring segments from moderately hyperbilirubinemic mice. The reduction of superoxide production in the vasculature by bilirubin is associated with the increase in the bioavailability of nitric oxide as reflected in the nitrate/nitrite levels in the plasma of chronically infused Ang II hypertensive mice made moderately hyperbilirubinemic.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^d40cfa4e]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional design, which allows us to identify only associations and should not yield any conclusions about causation. In addition, results of this study may not be applicable to the general population or to patients with type 2 diabetes in a primary care clinic because the data were collected from patients in an outpatient clinic of a university hospital. This study's results are not definitive because a Pearson's correlation coefficient of less than ± 0.25 is generally considered to be a weak correlation. We think prompt further research into this interesting correlation will be needed. Second, we were unable to explain the reason why both the non-diabetic and diabetic group had the same results. Third, liver ultrasonography for diagnosing NAFLD was not performed. Finally, we used eGFR instead of a directly measured GFR to assess renal function. It is known that current eGFR experiences greater inaccuracy in populations with no known CKD than in those with CKD. Nonetheless, the current eGFR technique facilitates the detection, evaluation, and management of renal disease.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and 24-hour urine protein excretion in non-diabetic subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although we are unable to determine whether hypobilirubinemia has a causative effect, these findings suggest that hypobilirubinemia combined with diabetes might be associated with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Large prospective trials are needed to better assess the effects of bilirubin on diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### The prognostic significance of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia in cardiac surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d2bccb5a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and registration

This systematic review and meta-analysis was constructed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement, and conducted according to methodological guidance. Details of the protocol of this prognostic research review were registered prospectively (PROSPERO ID CRD42020206068). There were no protocol deviations.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies met the following criteria (a) randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials (case control or controlled cohort), observational studies (b) study population of adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) (c) exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valvular surgery or combined CABG and valvular surgery (e) outcome measure of plasma bilirubin reported (f) outcome measure of mortality or morbidity measured. Studies involving organ transplant, ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were excluded.

Search strategy

OVID Medline and OVID Embase were searched from inception to July 2020 using a set of a validated and comprehensive keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) relating to 'cardiac surgery', 'hyperbilirubinemia' and 'mortality and morbidity' (see Additional file 1). Reference lists from published articles were hand searched for potentially relevant studies. No restrictions were placed on language or publication year. The reference lists of the included studies were separately searched for further potential citations.

Study selection

Two reviewers (DR and LP) independently screened titles and abstracts of all identified studies. Full text screening of potentially relevant studies was performed by the same reviewers with a third author (JPD) adjudicating any disagreements. The definition of hyperbilirubinemia was as defined by the authors in each study, if no definition was given a cut-off of 3 mg/dL (51.3 µmol/L) was used.

Data extraction and management

Two reviewers (DR and LP) independently extracted the following information onto standardised forms: Study designs, population demographics, co-morbidities, operative details, proportion with PH, timing of PH peak, conjugated vs unconjugated phenotype of PH, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, post-operative ventilation time and mortality following discharge (see Additional file 2). Where provided, maximally adjusted odds ratio (OR) for short term survival were used. Mean differences were used for continuous outcomes. Where studies stratified patients into more than two groups (e.g. tertiles or quartiles) we compared the upper most quantile against the cumulative lowermost quantiles.

### Low serum bilirubin concentration is a predictor of chronic kidney disease [^31258277]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. It is very important to identify the factors that affect CKD. Previous studies have reported that serum bilirubin concentration was positively correlated with renal function in a cross-sectional study. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and the progression of CKD.

Methods

A cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of 2784 subjects without CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), at baseline. We analyzed the relationship between serum total bilirubin concentration at baseline and new-onset CKD in the general population.

Results

We followed the subjects for a median period of 7.7 years. There were 1157 females and 1627 males, and 231 females and 370 males developed CKD during this period. Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed that serum total bilirubin concentration (hazard ratio (HR) per 1.0 μmol/L increase 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.99), P = 0.0084) in addition to age, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), uric acid (UA), creatinine and medication for hypertension in men and serum total bilirubin concentration (HR per 1.0 μmol/L increase 0.96 (95% CI 0.93–1.00), P = 0.0309) in addition to age, GGT, alanine aminotransferase, UA, creatinine and medication for dyslipidemia in women were independent predictors of new-onset CKD, after adjusting for confounders.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration could be a novel risk factor for the progression of CKD, defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), in the general population.

### Total bilirubin as a marker for hemolysis and outcome in patients with severe ARDS treated with veno-venous ECMO [^a684a635]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with ARDS and treatment with veno-venous ECMO, elevated plasma concentrations of CFH are known to be associated with increased ICU-mortality and organ failure. Serum bilirubin may not only act as a marker of disease severity and hemolysis, but has also been proposed to contribute to disease progression in ARDS patients, e.g. by direct toxic effects of bilirubin on lung surfactant. As a downstream product of CFH metabolism, bilirubin plasma concentration might be affected not only by the underlying disease but also by the degree of hemolysis induced by extracorporeal circulation. In this study, the prognostic potential of elevated initial total bilirubin (tBili) concentrations for survival and recovery from organ dysfunctions including successful weaning from organ replacement therapies in patients with ARDS and therapy with veno-venous ECMO was investigated.

### Identifying potential therapeutic applications and diagnostic harms of increased bilirubin concentrations: a clinical and genetic approach [^3a8c4f65]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal studies and protects against inflammatory, cardiovascular, and other diseases in observational studies; therefore, bilirubin has potential as a therapeutic agent. However, observational studies could be confounded by many factors. We used a genetic (n = 61,281) and clinical (n = 234,670) approach to define the association between bilirubin and 19 conditions with a putative protective signal in observational studies. We also tested if individuals with genetically higher bilirubin levels underwent more diagnostic tests. We used a common variant in UGT1A1 (rs6742078) associated with an 26% increase in bilirubin levels in the genetic studies. Carriers of the variant had higher bilirubin levels (P = 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶) but there was no significant association with any of the 19 conditions. In a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) to seek undiscovered genetic associations, the only significant finding was increased risk of "jaundice-not of newborn". Carriers of the variant allele were more likely to undergo an abdominal ultrasound (odds ratio = 1.04, [1.00–1.08], P = 0.03). In contrast, clinically measured bilirubin levels were significantly associated with 15 of the 19 conditions (P < 0.003) and with 431 clinical diagnoses in the pheWAS (P < 1 × 10⁻⁵ adjusted for sex, age, and follow-up). With additional adjustment for smoking and body mass index, 7 of 19 conditions and 260 pheWAS diagnoses remained significantly associated with bilirubin levels. In conclusion, bilirubin does not protect against inflammatory or other diseases using a genetic approach; the many putative beneficial associations reported clinically are likely due to confounding.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^5ed683c9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy defined by the new onset of hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria and/or signs of maternal organ dysfunction. It complicates approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies and is responsible for at least 17% of maternal deaths worldwide. PE may progress to multiorgan failure and maternal mortality, and it is a major contributor to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to compromised placental perfusion and preterm delivery. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain incompletely elucidated.

Due to its involvement in diverse pathological pathways and its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, PE is frequently described as a "disease of theories". The clinical course of PE can deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably, and currently, the only definitive treatment is delivery. The potential for life-threatening complications — such as acute renal injury, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological, cardiac, or hematologic involvement — has intensified efforts to enhance early diagnosis and risk prediction. Nevertheless, existing predictive tools remain suboptimal. A 2024 study reported a predictive accuracy of only 41% for term PE at a 10% false-positive rate, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic strategies. Consequently, ongoing research continues to seek improvements in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of PE.

The pathophysiology of PE is characterized by abnormal placental perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent cellular injury. This injury is commonly associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a well-established marker of cellular damage. Hemolysis is also a prominent feature, resulting in erythrocyte destruction and the release of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is enzymatically degraded by heme oxygenase (HO) into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. While bilirubin possesses notable antioxidant properties, it may exert cytotoxic effects when present at elevated concentrations. In the circulation, bilirubin binds tightly to albumin and is transported to the liver, where it undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, increasing its solubility and facilitating biliary excretion. Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin typically reflect hemolysis or impaired hepatic conjugation, whereas increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin suggests biliary obstruction or impaired hepatic excretory function.

### Cholic acid therapy in zellweger spectrum disorders [^9a8902d5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment with a combination of CA and CDCA was previously reported to lower bile acid intermediates in urine and plasma in a single ZSD patient with a severe phenotype. Additionally, levels of liver enzymes in plasma declined, growth rate improved and the degree of steatorrhea reduced (Setchell et al). Another two ZSD patients were treated with CDCA and/or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with different results on biochemical outcome. CDCA treatment alone resulted in decreased levels of THCA and DHCA in urine and plasma, but with an increase in the total serum bilirubin level. Similar results were found with UDCA treatment, albeit without increase in plasma transaminases and bilirubin. The second patient was treated with UDCA combined with CDCA, leading to decreased bile acid intermediates in plasma. Short single treatment with CDCA resulted in an increase of ALT, which recovered after the initiation of UDCA (Maeda et al). Furthermore, it has been reported that liver enzymes levels in plasma improved in patients with a defect in bile acid synthesis (Gonzales et al). In our study, we also observed decreased levels of DHCA and THCA in urine and plasma, but no positive effect on liver enzymes was observed. It should be noted that some patients, especially those in group 1, already had normal levels of AST, ALT and conjugated bilirubin at baseline. In patients with an increased AST and/or ALT at baseline (patient 1, 11, 13–19), these levels remained unaltered or increased after treatment with CA, particularly in those with advanced liver disease.

Limitations of our study are that the degree of steatorrhea and the effect of CA therapy on this parameter was not measured, the small size of the cohort, especially the number of patients in group 2, and the lack of a placebo arm in this trial. Despite the small number of patients in group 2, the correlation between the advanced liver disease and increase in plasma ALT, AST and conjugated bilirubin upon cholic acid treatment in these patients seems to be clearly present. This is supported by the finding that the levels of conjugated bilirubin, ALT and AST returned to baseline after cessation of cholic acid supplementation in one of these four patients (patient 16). Furthermore, Fibroscan® liver stiffness measurement is an accurate method to diagnose liver cirrhosis, which we used to define our patient groups, but is probably less useful to discriminate between various stages of liver fibrosis and therefore to assess therapeutic effect of CA (Chang et al).

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^e493f6c5]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, kidney function and proteinuria have yet to be fully elucidated, nor have these relationships been investigated in Korean adults.

Method

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults who were evaluated at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. We evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older.

Results

The values of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 24-hour urine albumin ≥ 150 mg/day were observed in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of subjects, respectively. Fasting glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL were observed in 44.9% (n = 612) of the total sample. After adjustment for potential confounding factors including demographic characteristics, comorbidities and other laboratory measures, total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with proteinuria both in the whole cohort and in a subgroup of diabetic individuals.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the relationships among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein and kidney function in Korean adults. We demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

### Atazanavir (atazanavir sulfate) [^8e2b2a5b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and mendelian randomisation associations [^2771833f]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Other associations included skin colour and associated questionnaire outcomes (eg, ease of skin tanning), both of which had strong associations (P < 1×10⁻⁷), and the skin condition pityriasis rosea (1.47 (1.27 to 1.69), P = 1.28×10⁻⁷), which is not a known association of Gilbert.

rs887829-T homozygosity was associated with small changes in specific measured biomarkers (calcium, cholesterol, and HbA 1c), although the absolute effect size of these changes was small: standard deviation change in calcium −0.037 (95% confidence interval −0.027 to −0.047), cholesterol 0.023 (0.012 to 0.033), and Hba 1c −0.019 (−0.01 to −0.032).

Association between bilirubin, genetically predicted bilirubin, and associations with health outcomes

Given the above findings, which suggested a relatively weak association between Gilbert syndrome and major health outcomes, we investigated the association between (observational) measured bilirubin levels and health outcomes and compared this relation with genetic data.

In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (online supplemental tables 2 and 3), serum bilirubin had a strong relation with a wide range of health outcomes. Of the 839 health outcomes included, 418 (50%) showed evidence of association at an unadjusted threshold of P < 0.05. When adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, liver disease, baseline C-reactive protein, body mass index, and renal function, 277 (66%) of these 418 outcomes persisted at this threshold. For nearly all associations (373 (89%) of 418), the effect estimate for the unadjusted model was greater than the adjusted model. The strongest association was with ICD code E80 for disorders of porphyrin and bilirubin metabolism (unadjusted odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.21), P < 1×10⁻³²⁰) per each mmol/L increase in bilirubin), which represents the code for Gilbert syndrome. Some associations had very strong statistical evidence but had implausible causal mechanisms, for example, an association with increased rates of perineal laceration during delivery (P = 1.8×10–30).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^f23e6e58]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^fa0024a2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite endless attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, singular focus on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. The resultant inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered successful translation of promising therapeutics. Over the past decade, however, the emerging field of clinical proteomics reinvigorates hope of identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for use in clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles including interpretive difficulties inherent in using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, a need to better evaluate the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical end points, and a potential over-reliance on use alone of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

### High-normal unconjugated bilirubin is associated with decreased risk of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: a real-world study [^65b6ef4a]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) within normal limits and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in T2DM patients.

Method

This cross-sectional, real-world study was performed in 8661 hospitalised T2DM patients. The subjects were stratified into quintiles based on serum UCB levels. The clinical characteristics and CKD prevalence were compared among the UCB quantile groups. The associations of serum UCB levels and quintiles with CKD were also analysed by binary logistic regression.

Results

After controlling for age, sex, and diabetes duration (DD), the CKD prevalence (20.4%, 12.2%, 10.6%, 8.3%, and 6.4% for the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles, respectively, p < 0.001 for trend) was significantly decreased across the serum UCB quintiles. The fully adjusted regression model showed negative associations of serum UCB levels (OR: 0.660, 95% CI: 0.585–0.744; p < 0.001 for trend) and quintiles (p < 0.001) with the presence of CKD. Compared with the subjects in the lowest UCB quintile, the risk of CKD decreased by 36.2%, 54.3%, 53.8%, and 62.1%, respectively, in those from the second to the highest UCB quintile. Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the subjects with CKD than in those without CKD (p < 0.001), and significantly decreased across the UCB quintiles (p < 0.001 for trend).

Conclusions

Serum UCB levels within the normal range were significantly and negatively linked to CKD in T2DM patients. High-normal UCB may be an independent protective factor for CKD by its antioxidant and the following anti-inflammatory activities through its signalling activity, which was indicated by clearly decreased CRP levels across the UCB quintiles.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^86a0ebb7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

### Jaundice in low birthweight infants: pathobiology and outcome [^82c82ab3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Jaundice in preterm, as well as full term, infants results from (a) an increased bilirubin load in the hepatocyte, (b) decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin from the plasma, and/or (c) defective bilirubin conjugation. Hyperbilirubinaemia in preterm infants is more prevalent, more severe, and its course more protracted than in term neonates.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^20beac41]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level thus can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infant's age in hours. Because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability, infants at greatest risk are those who have increased bilirubin production rates, because of hemolysis, for example. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies as well as noninvasive technologies to treat and to identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates, respectively, are tantamount to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^48109239]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously or can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. These disorders-Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome-both involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

### Binimetinib (Mektovi) [^f0b03333]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Distribution

Binimetinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins and the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.72. The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution of binimetinib is 92 L (45%).

Elimination

The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t1/2) of binimetinib is 3.5 hours (28.5%) and apparent clearance (CL/F) is 20.2 L/h (24%).

Metabolism

The primary metabolic pathway is glucuronidation with UGT1A1 contributing up to 61% of the binimetinib metabolism. Other pathways of binimetinib metabolism include N-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, and loss of ethane-diol from the side chain. The active metabolite M3 produced by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 represents 8.6% of the binimetinib exposure. Following a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib, approximately 60% of the circulating radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib.

Excretion

Following a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib in healthy subjects, 62% (32% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in the feces while 31% (6.5% unchanged) was recovered in the urine.

Specific Populations

Age (20 to 94 years), sex, or body weight do not have a clinically important effect on the systemic exposure of binimetinib. The effect of race or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib is unknown.

Hepatic Impairment: No clinically meaningful changes in binimetinib exposure (AUC and Cmax) were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 and ≤ 1.5 × ULN and any AST or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) as compared to subjects with normal liver function (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN). A 2-fold increase in AUC was observed in subjects with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 and ≤ 3 × ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin levels > 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Renal Impairment: In subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m²), no clinically important changes in binimetinib exposure were observed as compared to subjects with normal renal function.

### Bilirubin as an indicator of cardiometabolic health: a cross-sectional analysis in the UK biobank [^7c3ffea0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin and associations with blood lipid patterns

Bilirubin was linearly inversely associated with PC1 lipids, similarly among men and women. Non-linear positive associations were observed with PC2 lipids, exhibiting a steep increase from low to median levels of bilirubin and a null association from median to higher levels of bilirubin. Similar non-linear positive associations were observed with PC3 lipids. Bilirubin was non-linearly inversely associated with PC4 lipids. These associations were most pronounced between low to median levels of bilirubin, among men and women, and flattened off between median to elevated levels of bilirubin (Fig. 2 A and B).

Bilirubin and associations with components of the MetS

Men and women with bilirubin levels ≥ 17.1 µmol/L, compared to bilirubin < 10 µmol/L had 32% (99% CI 29%-34%) and 46% (99% CI 43%-49%) lower odds of exceeding the clinical cut off for WC (> 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women), respectively. Similar inverse associations were observed for exceeding the upper clinical cut off for TG (Table 2). Furthermore, men and women with bilirubin levels ≥ 17.1 µmol/L, compared to bilirubin < 10 µmol/L had 13% (99% CI 10%–17%) and 11% (99% CI 6%–15%) lower odds of exceeding systolic BP levels of ≥ 130 mm Hg (i.e. hypertension), respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^5b449e9b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### A UGT1A1 variant is associated with serum total bilirubin levels, which are causal for hypertension in African-ancestry individuals [^301fb2a1]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperbilirubinemia has several causes, including hemolysis, cirrhosis, and bile duct obstruction. In the absence of liver disease, high circulating bilirubin levels have been associated with the reduced risk of several diseases, including respiratory diseases; oxidative stress-mediated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, cancer, and cardiovascular disease –; and hypertension. The protective effect of bilirubin may be due to antioxidant activity –. There is also evidence that higher bilirubin is associated with the better survival and functional independence in the elderly.

The heritability of serum bilirubin has been estimated to be 48 ± 6%. The genetic architecture of circulating bilirubin levels has been studied through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have revealed several associated variants in one locus, UGT1A1 (refs. –). UGT1A1 has been found to be a major locus for serum total bilirubin (TBIL) in studies of Han Chinese, individuals with European ancestry, and African Americans. The SNP rs887829 in UGT1A1 accounts for 12% of the variance of TBIL levels in African Americans. UGT1A1, a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, is the sole enzyme that glucuronidates bilirubin.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique for using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate the casual effect between exposure and outcome, and has been successfully used in studies of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart failure, stroke, and nephrology. The genetic architecture of common, complex diseases generally consists of common genetic variants with small effect sizes, and it is typically not possible to draw inferences using MR with only a single variant. However, serum metabolites may have simpler genetic architectures, sometimes with a single variant that can be used as a strong IV by itself –.

Here, we describe a GWAS for serum TBIL in West Africans. We confirm that UGT1A1 is a major locus for serum TBIL, with conditional analysis revealing only one association signal indexed by rs887829. Using rs887829 as an IV, we demonstrate a causal effect of serum TBIL on hypertension in African Americans, with lower serum (TBIL) being a causal risk factor for hypertension.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^6a130be4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Associations between different bilirubin subtypes and diabetic microvascular complications in middle-aged and elderly individuals [^2e1b25a8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to high ACR, we found that the incidence and severity of DR were associated with lower DBIL and TBIL levels, but not IBIL level. Indeed, previous studies about the association between TBIL and DR are inconsistent. Some cross-sectional studies reported a significant negative relationship between TBIL and DR, – which was consistent with our results. Furthermore, a five-year cohort study that consisted of 5323 Chinese male diabetic patients suggested that serum TBIL had a U-shaped relationship with DR incidence. Another previous study found no association between TBIL and DR. The controversy in the studies may be due to adjustments for different covariates, variations in population sampling and the quality of the assessment of retinopathy. Interestingly, we found that DBIL was negatively associated with the incidence and severity of DR. As far as we know, our study is the first to reveal a negative and significant association between DBIL and DR. Thus, whether lower DBIL might be a clinical marker for predicting the occurrence of DR should be further investigated.

Although the mechanisms linking bilirubin subtype and diabetic microvascular complications are still unclear, some possible explanations can be proposed. One is the different binding affinities of the different bilirubin forms for albumin. DBIL, which binds weakly to albumin, plays an important role in preventing lipid peroxidation as a chain-breaking antioxidant. An epidemiological study found that, compared with IBIL and TBIL, DBIL was more strongly correlated with a level of small, dense LDLand metabolic syndrome, which are risk factors for diabetic microvascular complications. DBIL-mediated inhibition of immune reactions and inflammatory processes, and as a marker reflecting heme oxygenase-1 activity, may be the other reason. DBIL may possess cytoprotective effects, mediated through albumin-bound bilirubin protecting plasma and mitochondrial membranes from damage by removal of reactive oxygen species at physiological concentrations. Evidence from population studies suggested that increased serum concentrations of DBIL, rather than TBIL, may participate in the protection of cardiovascular function. Furthermore, in the Eisai hyperbilirubinemia rat, a model of Dubin–Johnson syndrome that usually manifests as recurrent jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, findings have suggested that increased concentrations of DBIL had a protective effect against focal ischemia, possibly participating in heme oxygenase-1-induced neuroprotection. More studies are required to elucidate the specific discrepancies between DBIL and IBIL with respect to their molecular mechanisms of action.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^565a6b6f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Biliary atresia and other congenital liver diseases are distinguished from physiological prolonged neonatal jaundice as they are associated with conjugated (direct), rather than unconjugated, hyperbilirubinaemia.
The natural history of the total bilirubin level in the first 4 weeks of life in disease-free neonates is to decrease over time.
The criteria currently recommended for further investigation in cases of prolonged neonatal jaundice are variable and supported by little evidence.

What this study hopes to add?

In disease-free states, direct bilirubin decreases with age, particularly at the level of the individual. We produce centile charts that may serve as reference tools.
However, the direct–total bilirubin ratio shows no clear trend and thus is an unreliable marker of serious pathology, including congenital liver disease.
Our data support the NICE guidance advocating investigation for liver disease in neonates with conjugated bilirubin > 25 µmol/L, although more stringent criteria may also be valid.

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^867087cd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the 3 total serum bilirubin ranges.

Results

Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the 3 total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < .0001). There was no significant trend in comparable sensitivity values (0.380, 0.417, and 0.241, respectively) with P = 0.55. The false-positive proportion also increased as a function of total serum bilirubin (17.5%, 17.3%, and 72.0%) with P < .0001. Thus, if a patient's total serum bilirubin was elevated to the point of jaundice (> 3.0 mg/dL), it was approximately 4 times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive" (ie, nitrite-positive/culture-negative) compared with those with normal serum bilirubin levels.

Conclusions

Specificity of the urine nitrite test for urinary tract infection decreases as a function of increasing serum bilirubin. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a positive nitrite test in our sample did not have an associated urinary tract infection.

Evaluation of liver function in HT candidates — liver enzymes and function tests provide prognostic information but require specific caveats. Hepatic function includes hepatic protein synthesis, bilirubin disposition, and energy metabolism, and abnormalities are associated with worse prognosis in patients with HF; it is necessary to distinguish hyperbilirubinemia due to liver disease from disorders that affect bilirubin conjugation, and in FALD, albumin levels may be depressed because of protein-losing enteropathy. In both acute and chronic HF, abnormal liver-related laboratory testing is associated with a worse overall prognosis.

### Plasma calprotectin level: usage in distinction of uncomplicated from complicated acute appendicitis [^3ff1f47e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The lifetime occurrence of acute appendicitis (AA) is approximately 7–8% and it is the most common disease, which find in emergency surgery. Although the most severe of all adverse events, mortality in developed health systems is low (between 0.09% and 0.24%) and does not have a sensitivity to detect differences in care processes that lead to variation in other outcomes. No inflammatory marker alone, such as white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) or other novel tests, including procalcitonin, can identify AA with high specificity and sensitivity. However, WBC count is obtained in virtually all patients who are assessed for AA, when available. A range of novel biomarkers has been suggested during the past decade, including bilirubin, but these do not have external validity and suffer repeatedly from low sensitivity, which means they are unlikely to come into clinical practice. Initial reliance on ultrasound (USG) has become more guarded recently because of moderate sensitivity (86%, CI 83–88) and specificity (81%, CI 78–84) as shown through pooled diagnostic accuracy of 14 studies, limiting its diagnostic ability. In adolescent and adult patients, computed tomography (CT) has become the most widely accepted imaging strategy. It is used in 86% of patients, with a sensitivity of 92 · 3%. The rate of negative appendectomy decreased significantly over time, from 12 · 7% in 1995 to 2 · 8% in 2006.

Calprotectin (Cal) S-100 is a 36-kDa heterodimer that belongs to the family of calcium-binding proteins, which involve both lights (MRP8) and heavy (MRP14) chains and were identified as an antimicrobial protein in granules of neutrophils and to a lesser extent in monocytes and reactive macrophages. Cal was counting 60% of the total cytosolic protein in neutrophils, which provide to separate these from monocytes during cell death and cell rupture. In the presence of an ongoing cycle of inflammation, Cal levels are increased in plasma, synovial fluid, urine and tool. Thus, Cal levels in plasma and various body fluids have been proposed as a marker of inflammation.

In this prospective study, the authors have aimed to compare of inflammatory markers, which use in routine practice and plasma Cal values and to identify the role of plasma Cal values in the diagnosis of complicated and uncomplicated AA. Therefore, in this study, we measured plasma Cal and CRP levels in patients with AA to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the combined use of these markers.

### Widespread recessive effects on common diseases in a cohort of 44, 000 British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis with high autozygosity [^de2e373e]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondly, an intronic SNP in UGT1A6, rs6742078 (chr2:233763993G > T), identified with both imputation panels, was found to be associated with disorders of porphyrin and bilirubin metabolism. UGT1A6 encodes a uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]). UGTs are enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation of lipophilic molecules, including bilirubin, into the conjugated, hydrophilic form that can be excreted in the urine. UGT1A6 has been shown to be associated with bilirubin levels in the GWASs on liver traits and bilirubin levels. Mutations in UGTs, specifically UGT1A1, cause the well-known autosomal recessive conditions Gilbert's syndromeand Crigler-Najjar syndrome, in which affected individuals present with excess unconjugated bilirubin. The findings presented here demonstrate novel recessive associations between another UGT not previously reported and dysfunctional bilirubin clearance.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^9ab610ef]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Depending on the main bilirubin species in serum, hyperbilirubinemia is classified as unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Two main reasons for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are increased bilirubin production (e.g. hemolytic anemias, hemolysis) and defective hepatic bilirubin metabolism. The current bilirubin submodel reasonably recapitulated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients with GS and CNS, Gunn rats, and Ugt1a1 knockout mice (Figures 2 and 3). Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result from defective hepatobiliary transport of CB, such as cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, and genetic disease, including DJS and RS. Patients with RS present near complete loss of OATP1B1/1B3 function. At first glance, it seems counterintuitive that impaired function of the uptake transporter increases serum CB because CB is generated in the liver and mostly excreted into bile via MRP2. The study by van de Steeg et al. 8 suggested that although most of the CB is eventually excreted into bile, CB may undergo liver‐blood circulation to transfer CB from upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes. In the recirculation process, MRP3 mediates the efflux of CB from hepatocytes to sinusoidal blood, and OATP1B1/1B3 mediates reuptake of CB into the downstream hepatocytes. As a result, inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 prevents reuptake of CB, leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. By representing the cycling of CB between liver and sinusoidal blood, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients with DJS and RS were reasonably reproduced with the current bilirubin submodel (Figure 2). Interestingly, a search for endogenous markers for OATP1B1/1B3‐mediated drug‐drug interaction reported that serum UB and CB are sensitive markers for OAPT1B1/1B3 inhibition by rifampin. 31 Altogether, these data support the role of OATP1B1/1B3 in hepatic uptake of both UB and CB.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin clearance [^c51bde7a]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by increased bilirubin production or decreased bilirubin clearance. Reduced hepatic bilirubin clearance can be due to defective (i) unconjugated bilirubin uptake and intrahepatic storage, (ii) conjugation of glucuronic acid to bilirubin (e.g. Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, breast milk jaundice), (iii) bilirubin excretion into bile (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), or (iv) conjugated bilirubin re-uptake (Rotor syndrome). In this review, the molecular mechanisms and clinical manifestations of these conditions are described, as well as current approaches to diagnosis and therapy.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^b905c317]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults patients who had visited Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) from January 2005 to December 2009 and evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, eGFR and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older (669 men, 694 women, aged 54.6 ± 15.1 years, range 18–93 years). The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Kosin University Gospel Hospital.

Clinical and biochemical assessments

Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to the Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus. Nephropathy was graded as follows: normoproteinuria, urinary protein excretion less than 150 mg/day and macroproteinuria, greater than 150 mg/day.

As a surrogate for measuring renal function in the subjects, we estimated the GFR using a simplified form of the Modification of Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. The equation is as follows:

The exclusion criteria were as follows:

1) patients with malignant disease, liver cirrhosis, or hematologic disease;

2) patients with advanced renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level higher than 2.0 mg/dL);

3) patients whose serum bilirubin concentrations were greater than 1.2 mg/dL due to the high possibility of Gilbert syndrome.

4) patients with chronic hepatitis B or C

Total serum bilirubin concentrations (normal ranges: 0.2–1.0 mg/dL) were measured using an enzymatic method with bilirubin oxidase on an automatic analyzer (Hitachi 7600). Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were assessed using standard enzymatic methods. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected from patients who demonstrated proteinuria in a dipstick urine test.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 565 subjects were included in this survey, including 221 males (39.1%). The average age of the population was 40.33 ± 11.86 years; the average age of men was significantly higher than that of women (men = 42.10 ± 12.93 years; women = 39.20 ± 10.99 years; P = 0.011). In a comparison of baseline characteristics between the two genders, the levels of WC, SBP, DBP, TG, TBIL, IBIL, ALT, and AST were higher in men than women, and HDL-C levels were higher in women than in men. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). These data are shown in Table 1.

Incidence of MS

Follow-up was conducted with the subjects for 3233.04 person-years, with an average follow up time of 5.72 ± 1.49 years per subject. During this period, a total of 204 subjects developed MS, with a cumulative incidence of 36.11% (95% CI = 0.32–0.40) and an incidence density of 63.10/1000 person-years. Of the 221 men in the study, 70 developed MS, with a cumulative incidence of 31.67% (95% CI = 0.26–0.38) and an incidence density of 55.71/1000 person-years. The cumulative incidence increased with age (χ² trend = 43.166, P < 0.001). Of the 344 women in this study, 134 developed MS, with a cumulative incidence of 38.95% (95% CI = 0.34–0.44) and an incidence density of 67.80/1000 person-years. The cumulative incidence again increased with age (χ² trend = 76.391, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence and incidence density between men and women. These data are shown in Table 2.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^9f468a79]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

Hyperbilirubinemia — bilirubin measurement and consultation triggers state that the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin concentration should not be subtracted from the total serum bilirubin concentration when using Figs 2 or 3. If the direct-reacting or conjugated fraction of the TSB exceeds 50% of the TSB, consultation with a knowledgeable specialist (eg, pediatric gastroenterologist or neonatologist) is recommended, and the figure caption also advises to consult an expert. Infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8201f123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^5794d13f]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

Definition of covariates

To assess the potential influence of various factors on the outcomes, we identified several variables that may serve as confounding factors. These variables include age (quantified in years), race (categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other), marital status (categorized as married/living with partner, widowed/divorced/separated, or never married), education level (categorized into less than high school, high school, or beyond high school), and alcohol use (categorized as never, former, or current). Smoking status was categorized into three groups: never (individuals who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime), former (individuals who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but currently do not smoke), and current (individuals who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke on some days or every day). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by the square of height and categorized into normal (BMI < 25 kg/m 2), overweight (25 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.9 kg/m 2), or obesity (≥ 30 kg/m 2). Hypertension was determined by a physician's diagnosis, a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes was identified by a physician's diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, random blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, or anti-hyperglycemic medication use. This comprehensive categorization elucidates the potential confounders affecting the study's results.

Blood-based biomarker characteristics and limitations — technical remarks: Direct and indirect blood biomarkers include components (bilirubin, aminotransferases, platelets, and other acute-phase reactants) that may be associated with false-positive or false-negative results in disorders such as acute hepatitis, hemolysis, Gilbert's syndrome, HIV-induced thrombocytopenia, splenectomy, and disease or treatment-related elevation in bilirubin or aminotransferases. Blood-based biomarkers have high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for "ruling out" advanced fibrosis in NAFLD but low positive predictive value (PPV) to "rule-in" advanced fibrosis in low prevalence cohorts. There are no validated blood-based biomarker thresholds that correlate with fibrosis stage following sustained virologic response (SVR) in HCV, and both indirect and direct biomarkers are associated with high false-negative rates for advanced fibrosis following antiviral therapy in patients with HBV or HCV. Although not included in the systematic review, NFS can be used to detect F3-4 in those with NAFLD.

### Zongertinib (Hernexeos) [^0fb1e651]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elimination

Zongertinib effective half-life is 12 hours (21%) with an apparent (oral) clearance of 115 mL/min (31%).

Metabolism

Based on in vitro metabolite profiling, CYP-mediated oxidation pathways represent 48% to 62% (mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), glucuronidation 13% to 25% (mainly UGT1A4), and glutathione conjugation 13% to 26% of total hepatic metabolism. Unchanged zongertinib represented the majority (75%) of total radioactivity in plasma.

Excretion

After a single oral dose of radiolabeled zongertinib 60 mg to healthy participants, approximately 93% of the dose was recovered in feces (31% unchanged) and 1.3% in urine (0.2% unchanged).

Specific Populations

The apparent volume of distribution and clearance of zongertinib increase with increasing body weight (34 to 122 kg).

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zongertinib were observed based on age (30 to 88 years), sex, race (36% White, 49% Asian, 1.3% Black/African American), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to < 90 mL/min) or mild hepatic impairment (AST > ULN and total bilirubin ≤ ULN; or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5× ULN and any AST).

Results

NEPTUNE urine collection protocol

A defined urine collection procedure (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1; and Additional Methods-Manuals of Procedures for Spot Urine and for 24-h Urine Processing) was created based upon best practices and literature review. This approach was employed to provide a standardized collection procedure applied to all participating centers. Samples are collected using two working protocols: (1) from 24-h whole urine collection, and (2) spot urine collections (recorded as "am" or "pm" void). A total of 13 visits are planned for the anticipated 600 participants in the study. In each visit, a total of 11 tubes will be generated: three 5 mL tubes (n = 4 times), seven 2 mL tubes (n = 12), and one 50 mL tube (n = 2). In other words, a total of 121 samples will be generated per participant over 13 visits. To date, about 400 participants have been enrolled in the study. We anticipate there will be up to 72,600 urine samples collected through the study timeframe.

### Hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia: 37 years later [^d34d0de0]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic re uptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.

A striking correlation was evident between CKA-induced elevations in plasma bile acids and total bilirubin and the effects of CKA administration on kinetic parameters of hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of gadoxetate (Fig. 8). In contrast, there was no correlation between the observed increases in plasma ALT levels and the hepatic uptake rate k 1 (r 2 = 0.44) or the biliary efflux K M (r 2 = 0.41).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^1cfe508a]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry

Total and direct bilirubin on all samples was measured using the Roche/Hitachi 902 which employs diazo methods. Bilirubin in plasma exists in three forms: unconjugated bilirubin (reversibly bound to albumin; usually the major component), free conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin covalently bonded to albumin; normal range approximately 0.0–3.0 µmol/L). Using diazo methods for direct bilirubin, both conjugated and delta bilirubin are measured photometrically and thus the value is a little higher than conjugated bilirubin alone.

### The direct spectrophotometric method is reliable for initial assessment of total bilirubin in neonatal venous plasma [^36105dc8]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the consistency of bilirubin values between the direct spectrophotometric (DS) and colorimetric diazo (diazo) methods in neonatal venous plasma specimens.

Methods

We measured the total bilirubin via the DS and diazo methods in 255 neonatal venous plasma specimens and compared the overall and subgroup results.

Results

Slight underestimation of total bilirubin values in most specimens using the DS method was observed, with higher mean biases found in higher concentrations. Significantly high positive correlations were found in all groups in which most of the different values were within the limits of agreement. DS cutoff of > 12 mg/dL showed 100% for all predictive indices in comparison with the diazo cutoff > 15 mg/dL.

Conclusions

Measurement of total bilirubin in neonatal venous plasma using the DS method had favorable agreement and high correlation with the diazo method. Therefore, the direct spectrophotometric method can be used as a reliable screening method.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^376f0048]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^18367727]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^54ac9f04]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

We therefore sought to re-evaluate the poorly evidenced thresholds through characterising the natural history of both total and direct bilirubin levels. Total bilirubin levels have previously been shown to decrease reverse-exponentially with age in disease-free neonates, but to our knowledge the variation of direct bilirubin levels with age in this population is yet to be characterised (explaining the lack of evidence behind NICE's 25 µmol/L cut-off). Hence, our aims were to establish the spread of direct bilirubin levels in our sample and concordantly inform national guidance for the investigation of prolonged neonatal jaundice.

### Pazopanib-induced hyperbilirubinemia is associated with Gilbert's syndrome UGT1A1 polymorphism [^3fcc0f0b]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

The practical implication of our finding is for clinicians to recognise that isolated hyperbilirubinemia in pazopanib-treated patients, after exclusion of other causes such as haemolysis, seems to have a benign aetiology. Given the life-threatening nature of cancer and the benign clinical course of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the data do not call for population-based prospective UGT1A1 screening to exclude patients from pazopanib monotherapy. Bilirubin fractionation should be conducted in patients who develop hyperbilirubinemia during pazopanib treatment, which could distinguish unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The latter would require further investigation. This may help to elucidate the nature of the bilirubin elevation and might enable differentiation of the risk of progression of drug-induced liver injury. A limitation of this study is the lack of bilirubin fractionation data to allow full assessment between the UGT1A1 polymorphism and unconjugated bilirubin levels.
