## Question

which medication for bph has less dry mouth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication for BPH has less dry mouth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which BPH drug classes actually cause dry mouth and which do not. Then, I should verify dry mouth rates across specific agents and formulations. Next, I will compare antimuscarinics versus beta-3 agonists head-to-head. After that, I should consider alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats about storage symptoms, post-void residual, and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the drug classes involved in BPH management and their propensity for dry mouth. Alpha-1 blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors treat voiding symptoms and do not cause anticholinergic dry mouth, whereas antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists are used for storage symptoms and have distinct anticholinergic or non-anticholinergic profiles, respectively [^116kk7qQ] [^1144fZu7] [^111uJzJS] [^113aQbAA].

> Wait, let me verify the anticholinergic burden across agents. Antimuscarinics as a class consistently increase dry mouth risk about threefold versus placebo, with pooled dry mouth rates commonly in the 20–40% range and higher with some agents, which aligns with guideline summaries and meta-analyses of OAB therapies and BPH combination studies [^111uJzJS] [^1168toB2] [^112Ssjet].

> I will now examine specific antimuscarinic dry mouth rates to avoid overgeneralization. Tolterodine immediate-release has about 35% dry mouth in trials, and tolterodine ER around 18–23%, while oxybutynin IR can reach roughly 60–70% and oxybutynin ER about 40%, and solifenacin around 20–30% depending on dose and study; fesoterodine tends to be higher than tolterodine ER, often near 20–30% or more, and trospium IR/ER sit roughly in the mid-teens to low-20s percent range, all of which are directionally consistent across head-to-head and guideline syntheses [^113k6mVF] [^113BXNy9] [^115u6Vwm] [^111mbzHL] [^1134bt47].

> Hold on, I should verify the beta-3 agonist signal. Mirabegron consistently shows dry mouth rates similar to placebo and markedly lower than antimuscarinics, typically in the 3–5% range in pooled analyses and head-to-head trials, with vibegron showing a similar non-anticholinergic profile; this is reinforced by AUA/SUFU OAB guidance noting fewer side effects, particularly less dry mouth and constipation, with beta-3 agonists compared with antimuscarinics [^1158zpMe] [^113emZt6] [^113aQbAA].

> Next, I should review direct head-to-head data in men with BPH and storage symptoms to ensure external validity. In a 12-week RCT of men with LUTS and erectile dysfunction, mirabegron plus doxazosin had 4% dry mouth versus 13% with tolterodine plus doxazosin; in another 12-week RCT, mirabegron plus silodosin had 3% dry mouth versus 12% with fesoterodine plus silodosin, supporting a roughly threefold difference favoring mirabegron combinations over antimuscarinic combinations in this population [^116pikdb] [^113aQbAA].

> But wait, what if the patient's symptoms are predominantly voiding rather than storage. I need to ensure I'm not conflating classes. Alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors do not cause dry mouth; alpha-blockers can cause dizziness, orthostasis, and ejaculatory dysfunction, and 5-ARIs can cause sexual adverse effects and gynecomastia, but neither class contributes to xerostomia, so for voiding-predominant LUTS these remain appropriate without dry mouth risk [^116kk7qQ] [^114FQQeN] [^116rwG2K] [^115YeTV9].

> Let me consider special populations and safety guardrails before concluding. In men with significant storage symptoms persisting on an alpha-blocker, adding a beta-3 agonist is reasonable and guideline-concordant; however, I should confirm post-void residual is not markedly elevated because antimuscarinics are generally avoided if PVR is greater than 150 mL, and even with mirabegron, monitoring for small PVR increases is prudent in older adults, even though clinically meaningful retention is uncommon in appropriately selected patients [^1142uuif] [^116mRXE8] [^1159QL24].

> I should double-check formulation effects because they meaningfully shift anticholinergic tolerability. Extended-release antimuscarinics reduce dry mouth compared with immediate-release, and transdermal oxybutynin further lowers dry mouth rates, though local skin reactions can occur; thus, if an antimuscarinic must be used, ER or transdermal formulations are preferred to mitigate xerostomia while preserving efficacy [^113BXNy9] [^111BE2nu] [^114ewmN8].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation matches the clinical phenotype. For men with BPH and bothersome storage symptoms in whom dry mouth is a priority, mirabegron or vibegron are the preferred pharmacologic choices because they are non-anticholinergic and have dry mouth rates around 3–5% versus 18–70% with oral antimuscarinics depending on agent and formulation; if an antimuscarinic is necessary, solifenacin or tolterodine ER are more tolerable than oxybutynin IR, and transdermal oxybutynin can further reduce dry mouth at the cost of skin reactions; for voiding-predominant symptoms, alpha-blockers or 5-ARIs remain appropriate and do not cause dry mouth [^1158zpMe] [^113aQbAA] [^116pikdb] [^113BXNy9] [^116kk7qQ].

> Final answer, keeping the nuance explicit: Among medications used for BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms, beta-3 agonists such as mirabegron have the least dry mouth, with rates approximately 3–5% and substantially lower than antimuscarinics; alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors do not cause dry mouth and are appropriate for voiding symptoms; if an antimuscarinic is required for storage symptoms, choose an ER formulation or consider transdermal delivery to reduce dry mouth, and avoid antimuscarinics when post-void residual exceeds 150 mL [^1158zpMe] [^113aQbAA] [^116kk7qQ] [^116mRXE8] [^113BXNy9].

---

For BPH with persistent storage symptoms despite alpha-blockers, **mirabegron has the lowest dry mouth risk** among add-on options, with dry mouth rates of 2–5% versus 10–20% for antimuscarinics [^1158zpMe] [^113emZt6]. If an antimuscarinic is needed, **solifenacin or tolterodine ER** have lower dry mouth rates than oxybutynin or fesoterodine, and ER formulations further reduce dry mouth compared with IR [^113BXNy9] [^111mbzHL]. Alpha-blockers and 5-ARIs do not cause dry mouth and are first-line for voiding symptoms; consider mirabegron add-on for storage symptoms to minimize dry mouth [^116kk7qQ] [^1142uuif].

## Medications for BPH and their association with dry mouth

### Alpha-blockers

Among alpha-blockers, **mechanism and dry mouth risk** reflect selective alpha-1 receptor antagonism that relaxes prostate and bladder neck smooth muscle; these agents do not block muscarinic receptors and therefore do not cause dry mouth. Commonly used agents — alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and silodosin — have **no significant dry mouth risk** in clinical practice [^116kk7qQ].

---

### 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)

For 5-ARIs, **mechanism and dry mouth risk** reflect inhibition of testosterone conversion to DHT, reducing prostate size; they do not affect muscarinic receptors and do not cause dry mouth. Finasteride and dutasteride have **no significant dry mouth risk** in clinical practice [^notfound].

---

### Antimuscarinic agents

Antimuscarinics block muscarinic receptors, reducing detrusor overactivity but **increasing dry mouth risk** through reduced salivary flow [^111uJzJS].

| **Medication** | **Dry mouth incidence** |
|-|-|
| Oxybutynin (IR) | 60–70% [^1134bt47] |
| Oxybutynin (ER) | 30–40% [^113BXNy9] |
| Tolterodine (IR) | 30–35% [^113k6mVF] |
| Tolterodine (ER) | 18–23% [^113BXNy9] |
| Solifenacin | 20–30% [^1134bt47] |
| Fesoterodine | 25–35% [^1134bt47] |

---

Extended-release formulations reduce dry mouth versus immediate-release, but **risk remains significant** [^113BXNy9].

---

### Beta-3 adrenergic agonists

Beta-3 agonists relax the detrusor via a non-antimuscarinic mechanism and have **minimal effect on salivary flow**, translating to low dry mouth risk [^113emZt6]. Mirabegron has a **dry mouth incidence of 2–5%**, similar to placebo and markedly lower than antimuscarinics [^1158zpMe].

---

## Comparative analysis of dry mouth incidence among BPH medications

Medications with **lowest dry mouth risk** include alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs, and mirabegron, which have minimal to no dry mouth risk. Medications with **moderate dry mouth risk** include solifenacin and tolterodine ER, which have lower rates than many antimuscarinics but still pose a meaningful risk. Medications with **high dry mouth risk** include oxybutynin (IR/ER) and fesoterodine, which have the highest anticholinergic burden and discontinuation rates due to dry mouth [^111mbzHL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Alpha-blockers or 5-ARIs for bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS/BPH; neither causes dry mouth [^116kk7qQ] [^116VJAZ4].
- **Storage symptoms**: If storage symptoms persist on alpha-blockers, consider adding mirabegron (low dry mouth) or an antimuscarinic with caution [^1142uuif] [^1178Whrn].
- **Antimuscarinic caution**: Use cautiously in patients with elevated post-void residual or bladder outlet obstruction due to retention risk [^1128oxah] [^116mRXE8].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dry mouth risk

- **Age**: Older adults have higher dry mouth risk and may need lower doses or alternative agents [^112Sd7Tj].
- **Comorbidities**: Xerostomia, Sjögren's, or other salivary disorders increase risk [^notfound].
- **Concomitant medications**: Other anticholinergics or serotonergic agents can worsen dry mouth [^111z6zFY].

---

## Strategies to minimize dry mouth

- **Hydration**: Encourage frequent sips of water and sugar-free gum/candy [^116Nj3NV].
- **Oral care**: Use saliva substitutes, non-alcohol rinses, and regular dental care [^116Nj3NV].
- **Dose/formulation**: Use lowest effective dose; prefer ER or transdermal formulations when antimuscarinics are necessary [^113BXNy9] [^111BE2nu].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess symptoms and adverse effects regularly to guide therapy adjustments [^112Gf7A7].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Dry mouth risk** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Alpha-blockers | Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin | None | First-line for voiding symptoms |
| 5-ARIs | Finasteride, dutasteride | None | First-line for enlarged prostates |
| Beta-3 agonist | Mirabegron | Low (2–5%) | Preferred add-on for storage symptoms |
| Antimuscarinics | Solifenacin, tolterodine ER | Moderate | Use cautiously; ER preferred |
| Antimuscarinics | Oxybutynin, fesoterodine | High | Avoid if dry mouth is a concern |

---

Alpha-blockers and 5-ARIs are **first-line and do not cause dry mouth** [^116kk7qQ]. For persistent storage symptoms, **mirabegron is the preferred add-on** because it has the lowest dry mouth risk among storage agents; if an antimuscarinic is needed, choose solifenacin or tolterodine ER and monitor for anticholinergic effects [^1142uuif] [^111uJzJS].

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — mirabegron plus doxazosin versus tolterodine plus doxazosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED): A single-blinded 12 weeks study in 55 Egyptian men compared mirabegron 50 mg + doxazosin 2 mg with tolterodine 4 mg + doxazosin 4 mg, excluding men with post-void residual > 150 mL; mean age was 59.5 years with baseline IPSS 17 points, diabetes 21% and hypertension 23%. At 12 weeks, IPSS showed MD -2.0 points [95% CI -4.94 to 0.94] and IPSS-QoL median scores were both 1 versus the tolterodine combination. No urinary retention or withdrawals due to adverse events were reported; overall withdrawals were 14% and 15% (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.27 to 3.47]). Dry mouth occurred in 4% with the mirabegron combination versus 13% with tolterodine; constipation and headaches were reported in a few patients. Combination therapy with a beta-3-agonist appears to be reasonably safe and tolerated and can lead to improvement in symptoms similar to those seen with anticholinergics, and in older patients or others where anticholinergic therapy is not recommended, a beta-3-agonist can be utilized.

### Role of antimuscarinics combined with alpha-blockers in the management of urinary storage symptoms in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168toB2]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining antimuscarinics with alpha-blockers to treat storage symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

Searches were carried out on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials published before February 15, 2022, assessing the efficacy or safety of antimuscarinics in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with alpha-blockers. Further meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean difference and risk ratio.

Results

A total of 12 randomized trials were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis showed no impact of antimuscarinics on the number of urgencies per day (SMD -0.23 [95%CI: -0.64; -0.17]; p = 0.21). However, the use of antimuscarinics was associated with a small reduction of micturition episodes per day (SMD -0.19 [95%CI: -0.37; -0.01]; p = 0.045). With regard to side effects, post-void residual increased slightly in patients treated with antimuscarinics (SMD 0.26 [95%CI: 0.15; 0.37]; P < .01). In addition, there was a higher risk of acute urinary retention (RR 3.26 [95%CI: 1.35; 7.86]; p = 0.02), dry mouth (RR 3.43 [95%CI: 1.86; 6.32]; P < .001), and constipation (RR 2.92 [95%CI: 1.48; 5.73]; P < .001) with the use of antimuscarinics. Finally, the risk of treatment interruption due to adverse events was higher for the patients treated with antimuscarinics (RR 1.74 [95%CI: 1.27; 2.38]; P < .01).

Conclusions

The addition of antimuscarinics to alpha-blockers was not associated with a substantial reduction in urgencies and micturition episodes in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with storage symptoms. In addition, the toxicity profile was not in favor of antimuscarinic use in these patients.

### Tolterodine extended release attenuates lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1134bQdY]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this open label, prospective study we determined the efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine extended release (ER) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in whom previous alpha-blocker therapy had failed.

Materials and Methods

A total of 43 consecutive men with BPH and LUTS in whom a mean of 5.7 months of alpha-blocker therapy had failed due to adverse events (11) or a lack of efficacy (32) received tolterodine ER (4 mg daily) for 6 months. Primary efficacy end points were American Urological Association symptom score, and mean daytime and nighttime micturition frequency. Secondary end points were the peak urinary flow rate, post-void residual volume, the incidence of urinary retention, total score on the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function and adverse events.

Results

A total of 39 men (91%) with a mean age of 61 years completed the 6-month trial. Mean 24-hour micturition frequency decreased from 9.8 to 6.3 voids and nocturia decreased from 4.1 to 2.9 episodes nightly. Significant changes in mean American Urological Association symptom scores (-6.1), the peak urinary flow rate (1.9 mL per second) and post-void residual volume (-22 ml) were also observed. Of the men 27 (63%) were potent at baseline and 29 (67%) were potent after 6 months of tolterodine ER treatment. Mean International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain scores increased (6.9). Four men (9%) discontinued therapy because of intolerable dry mouth. There were no reports of urinary retention.

Conclusions

Treatment with tolterodine ER in men with BPH and LUTS may be a reasonable therapeutic option as initial therapy or after failed treatment with alpha-blockers.

### Which anticholinergic is best for people with overactive bladders? A network meta-analysis [^112s1qgW]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To carry out a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anticholinergic drug treatment for people with overactive bladders.

Methods

Comprehensive searches for relevant RCTs were carried out starting with RCTs included in previous systematic reviews with the last search in February 2017. Searches included terms for the anticholinergic drugs tolterodine, oxybutynin, trospium, propiverine, solifenacin, darifenacin, imidafenacin, and fesoterodine. Data was extracted from the systematic reviews or reports of studies for cure or improvement, voids per 24hr, leakage episodes per 24hr and dry mouth. Data was analysed using frequentist network meta-analysis.

Results

128 studies were found. There was no clearly best treatment for cure or improvement. The differences between treatments for voids and leakages were small and unlikely to be of clinical importance. Transdermally delivered oxybutynin was clearly the best treatment for dry mouth but was still worse than placebo.

Conclusions

All the anticholinergic drugs were better than placebo but apart from dry mouth were similar in effect. Transdermal oxybutynin caused less dry mouth than the other treatments, so may be worth considering as the first treatment.

Patient-centered approaches to improve adherence and compliance in BPH medical management are stressed, noting that while medications are the mainstay, there is wide variability among prescribers in treatment choice. Appropriate and patient-centered therapeutic strategies continue to lag behind evidence-based medicine, which has led to poor adherence and compliance with various therapies. Contributing factors include insurance coverage, type of medication, side effects, cost, and availability of information technology, and managing patient expectations is variable among prescribers. Use of technology, improved informatics, and coalescence of treatment strategies are presented as opportunities to improve both short- and long-term safety and efficacy with medications and to provide more uniform approaches to treatment success and failure and gateways to minimally-invasive and surgical therapies.

### Comparison of add-on medications for persistent storage symptoms after α-blocker treatment in BPH patients-a network meta-analysis [^1159QL24]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our results indicated that add-on mirabegron was effective in treating residual OAB symptoms such as micturition, urgency, and nocturia in patients already receiving α-blockers, ranking second in improving the IPSS score and third in the IPSS storage subscore based on the SUCRA. Previous studies have corroborated our findings. Two RCTs reported that adding mirabegron to tamsulosin significantly improved the total IPSS, IPSS storage subscore, and total OABSS. Kaplan et al. reported that the addition of mirabegron to tamsulosin significantly improved micturition, urgency, total urgency, and frequency scores. A recent meta-analysis showed that add-on mirabegron therapy significantly reduced the mean number of micturition episodes, urgency episodes per day, and total OABSS compared with tamsulosin monotherapy. Mirabegron was also proven urodynamically efficacious and safe for treating men with BPH and OAB. Add-on mirabegron treatment significantly increased the Q max and voided volume. These findings may be attributed to the pharmacological characteristics of mirabegron. Mirabegron, as a β3-agonist, not only promotes relaxation of the detrusor smooth muscle to increase bladder capacity but also shows competitive antagonist activity on the α 1 -adrenoceptors in the urethra, resulting in urethral smooth muscle relaxation. Regarding the safety assessment, the incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with mirabegron added to α-blockers and α-blockers alone were similar, and TEAEs were mild in severity. Although an increase in PVR was observed with add-on mirabegron treatment in some studies, the change in PVR was not clinically meaningful. Mirabegron appears to be a safe treatment option for patients with predominantly coexisting OAB and BPH after receiving α-blockers. Furthermore, patients receiving mirabegron have significantly higher persistence and adherence rates than those treated with antimuscarinics, with lower occurrence of TEAEs including dry mouth and constipation. Because add-on mirabegron treatment exhibited satisfactory efficacy and safety and was well-tolerated, it could be an alternative choice for treating residual OAB symptoms in patients with BPH who have used α-blockers and are not satisfied with other add-on medications.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^111z6zFY]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Disputed use of selective alpha-1-blockers

The prevalence of BPH has been reported to increase with age, from 14.8% (in younger males aged 40) to 36.8% (in males aged 80 and above). Selective alpha-1-blockers are used to treat BPH and essential hypertension in older adults. Tachycardia and tremulousness are less common with the selective alpha-1-blockers; however it can cause first-dose hypotension, syncope, dizziness, and headache in the older people and increase the risk of falls. AUA being silent, EAU recommends it as the first line medical treatment of BPH whereas STOPP/START criteria recommends to avoid it in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension/micturition syncope.

Drugs with anti-muscarinic and anti-cholinergic properties

Anti-muscarinic drugs

The incidence of anti-muscarinic drugs use has been reported to increase with age. Various muscarinic receptor antagonists like darifenacin/fesoterodine/oxybutynin/propiverine/solifenacin/tolterodine etc. are licensed for treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Some drugs like antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-histaminics etc. have anticholinergic properties and have non-life-threatening side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, dry/itchy eyes, blurred vision, dyspepsia, UTI, urinary retention and impaired cognitive function. Rarely, life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmias have been reported.

The concurrent use of other anti-cholinergic medications may potentiate the side effects of the anti-muscarinic OAB medications. These drugs should therefore be prescribed with caution, and regular evaluation of IPSS and PVR urine is advised. Men should be advised to discontinue medication if worsening voiding LUTS or urinary stream is noted after initiation of therapy. In patients of dementia, anti-muscarinics should be used with extreme caution or may be contraindicated entirely depending on the level of cognitive impairment. As per Beer criteria, these medications should be avoided in older adults except a few selective drugs for the treatment of urinary incontinence. AUA recommends their use with caution in frail older adult patients with OAB and those using anticholinergic drugs concomitantly. However, EAU recommends to avoid their use in older adults or use with caution if volume of post void residual urine > 150 ml. STOPP/START guidelines recommends avoiding its use in older adults with dementia, narrow angle glaucoma and chronic prostatism and avoid concomitant use of two or more such drugs.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^111Ketst]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA BPH guideline nomenclature — recommendation strength and evidence descriptors — defines Strong Recommendation (Net benefit or harm substantial) when Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa) and Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial, with confidence language that includes Applies to most patients in most circumstances and future research is unlikely to change confidence, Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence could change confidence, or Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence is likely to change confidence (rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation). Moderate Recommendation (Net benefit or harm moderate) denotes a moderate net effect. Conditional Recommendation (Net benefit or harm comparable to other options) reflects Benefits = Risks/Burdens with decision-making statements such as Best action depends on individual patient circumstances, Best action appears to depend on individual patient circumstances, and in lower certainty Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear, Net benefit (or net harm) comparable to other options, Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable, and Better evidence likely to change confidence. Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature, and Expert Opinion is a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^113UQJE3]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Concerning anticholinergic drugs, great care is necessary when prescribing these drugs in the elderly, as cognitive deterioration may be a serious consequence and one must bear in mind that 16% of patients > 70 years show some form of cognitive impairment. Indeed, encephalic cholinergic activity, and in particular M1 and M2 receptors which represent over 60% of the brains cholinergic receptors, are vital in cognitive function. The only antimuscarinic which was accorded a beneficial safety profile in the elderly is Fesoterodine, as this drug was studied specifically in the ageing population. In the SOFIA trial 581 patients > 65, of which 33% were > 75 years old and frequently on polypharmacy, completed a 3 month double-blind randomized trial of Fesoterodine versus placebo. At 12 weeks, patients in the treatment arm demonstrated reduced urgency (−3.8 episodes), pollakiuria and nycturia (−0.55 episodes) (all p < 0.001) compared to placeebo. Fesoterodine determined a similar rate of adverse events compared to placebo (39.8% vs 36.1%), mostly mild xerostomia. Of note, no clinically relevant changes in cognitive function (evaluated through the mini-mental status examination) were observed throughout the study in both arms. This may be attributed to the high affinity of Fesoterodine for the M3 receptor and its inability to pass the blood–brain barrier. In any case, great care is advised with anticholinergic drugs and a high level of suspiciousness in case of cognitive deterioration while receiving treatment.

Intraprostatic agents

In addition to classic oral therapy, medical agents may be injected directly in the prostate. This is a promising minimally invasive approach in patients who are unresponsive to medical treatment, who experience debilitating AE or who are poor candidates for surgery. The rationale for this therapy is the ability of some agents to determine prostatic involution and promote apoptosis, thus shrinking prostatic volume and ameliorating LUTS. In addition, these agents may modulate prostatic afferent nerves, reducing nociception and improving BPH-related symptoms. However, it must be remembered that profound ameliorations were seen also in the sham arms of RCTs evaluating intraprostatic injections: as such, the results of such trials must always be redimensioned and relativized to the sham-control arm, rather than considering the absolute results.

### A retrospective study of treatment persistence and adherence to α-blocker plus antimuscarinic combination therapies, in men with LUTS / BPH in the Netherlands [^115HzWHT]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

FDC solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg is the only FDC α-blocker plus antimuscarinic approved for the treatment of men with LUTS/BPH and the inclusion of solifenacin within this FDC examined in our study may have contributed to the main findings. Previously reported data from a large, retrospective observational cohort study of 8694 men with LUTS/BPH in the UK showed that fewer patients discontinued (43.0% vs. [mean] 53.0%) or switched treatment (15.3% vs. [mean] 22.0%) from solifenacin compared with most other antimuscarinics, and persisted on-treatment for longer (median duration, 90 days vs. [range] 30–116 days). These findings are supported by further real-world data in patients with OAB, suggesting that solifenacin provides greater treatment persistence compared with other antimuscarinics (mean persistence 187 vs. 77–157 days; persistence at 12 months, 35% vs. 14%–28%). The reasons for improved persistence with solifenacin relative to other antimuscarinics are likely attributable to the favourable efficacy and tolerability profile for solifenacin. A long-term open label study of solifenacin for up to 1 year reported that 81% of patients completed 40 weeks of treatment and only 4.7% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs in patients with OAB. A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials conducted in adult patients with OAB showed that solifenacin 5 mg/day provides similar or better efficacy, and a lower or similar risk of dry mouth compared with other common oral antimuscarinics. Patients' perceptions of symptom control/bother may also be a factor in a decision to persist with or discontinue treatment. Patients receiving solifenacin for the treatment of OAB have reported significant improvements in health-related quality of life and perceived bother compared with active comparator treatment or placebo. Indeed, unmet treatment expectations and/or tolerability are the primary reasons for treatment discontinuation in up to 90% of non-persistent patients. In our study, although time to discontinuation and persistence were greater in patients receiving FDC or concomitant combinations containing solifenacin versus other antimuscarinics, the influence of solifenacin on switching could not be assessed due to low numbers of men (N = 75) who met the switching criteria (i.e. replacing a discontinued index drug with at least one new drug within 30 days of the discontinuation date).

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116gpf5R]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are a few reports of cost-effectiveness of drug treatment in LUTS, but this study represents the first cost-effectiveness analysis of a FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS. Overall, the results of this analysis indicate that the FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS is a cost-effective treatment option for men with LUTS/BPH who have moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms. The base-case analysis showed that the FDC tablet of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS is dominant (i.e. was associated with improved patient outcomes and lower costs) versus tolterodine plus tamsulosin over a 1-year time horizon.

The robustness of our cost-effectiveness model is demonstrated through the results of the univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, as well as the scenario analyses. The univariate analysis showed that several of the main drivers for superior cost-effectiveness of FDC solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS versus tolterodine plus tamsulosin were inputs related to treatment persistence. Data from several areas of medicine describe that adherence/persistence with medication is a key driver of cost-effectiveness. Two reports of real-world clinical practice data in the UK indicate improved persistence for solifenacin versus tolterodine in men with LUTS/BPH or overactive bladder (OAB). The THIN database reported that a lower proportion of men with LUTS/BPH discontinued and switched treatment (43% and 15%, respectively) compared with tolterodine (60% and 23%, respectively) over a median follow-up of 2 years. In addition, 35% of patients with OAB were still receiving solifenacin after 12 months compared with 28% for tolterodine ER. Further analyses should be conducted to confirm these observations, and various factors are likely to impact persistence. For example, solifenacin is reported to provide an improved efficacy (urgency and micturitions) and tolerability (dry mouth) profile compared with tolterodine. Subsequently, this may contribute to the increased persistence with solifenacin, resulting in fewer patients discontinuing medication, reduced switching and/or surgery costs, and improved quality of life. This is supported by the slightly better outcomes, QALY gains and lower overall costs, reported in our analysis.

### Initial combined treatment with anticholinergics and α-blockers for men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH and overactive bladder: a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1172iung]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment using anticholinergics with α-blocker for initial treatment of both overactive bladder (OAB) and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), secondary to BPH. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at four urology clinics in Korea, involving men, aged 50 years or older, with LUTS related to BPH and OAB. A total of 176 patients were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin (4 mg) plus placebo or doxazosin (4 mg) plus tolterodine SR (4 mg), once a day for 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), bladder diary variables, patient perception of bladder condition (PPBC), uroflowmetry, postvoid residual volume and IPSS subscores (voiding and storage) were analyzed. Of the 176 enrolled patients, 91 had doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and placebo, and 85 had combined medication with doxazosin GITS and tolterodine SR. Compared with the doxazosin plus placebo group, the doxazosin plus tolterodine group showed significant reductions in IPSS storage subscore and improvement in the quality of life item, urgency episodes, as well as in micturition frequency at weeks 4 and 12. However, it failed to improve PPBC at week 4 as well as at week 12. Earlier intervention with anticholinergics plus α-blocker was tolerated well, including the questions about urinary retention (n = 1) and dry mouth (n = 2). Initial combination treatment of anticholinergics plus α-blocker showed positive results for men with LUTS related to BPH and OAB symptoms and did not increase the risk of urinary retention.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113BXNy9]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU) Guideline Statement 9 — If an immediate release (IR) and an extended release (ER) formulation are available, then ER formulations should preferentially be prescribed over IR formulations because of lower rates of dry mouth. Standard. Evidence strength is Grade B with benefits outweighing risks/burdens, and a meta-analysis found fewer patient reports of dry mouth with ER oxybutynin and tolterodine than with IR; oxybutynin ER had 40.0% (95% CI: 28.0% to 53.0%) versus oxybutynin IR 69.0% (95% CI: 60.6% to 76.5%), and tolterodine ER 18.0% (95% CI: 14.8% to 21.4%) versus IR 28.8% (95% CI: 25.1% to 32.8%) with p < 0.01, and within each medication there was no relationship with dose. For trospium, IR trials reported dry mouth rates ranging from 19.8% to 41.4% of patients, whereas ER trials reported 8.7 to 12.9%. The discussion highlights that optimizing tolerability may improve compliance, that compliance with a once-daily treatment is greater than with medications taken more than once a day, and that the IR versus ER decision should consider prior experience and availability, including insurer constraints that may require initial IR use before approval for ER.

### The efficacy of additive tolterodine extended release for 1-year in older men with storage symptoms and clinical benign proastatic hyperplasia [^113VkqX4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the efficacy of toterodine extended release (ER) treatment for 1 year in older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and storage symptoms treated with alpha-blockers and/or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARI).

Methods

Men aged over 70 years with BPH/bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and clinical storage symptoms were randomly treated with or without tolterodine ER in combination with alpha-blockers and/or 5ARI for 12 months. Among them, 50 patients (group 1) received additive tolterodine extended release (ER) 4mg q.d., another 87 patients (group 2) did not. All patients had a baseline and 12th month post-treatment evaluation, which comprised of uroflowmetry, post-void residual (PVR) volume, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and quality of life index (QoL-I), transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and serum prostate specific antigen.

Results

One hundred thirty-seven of 153 enrolled patients with a mean age of 74.9 years completed the study. Treatment benefit demonstrated in both groups included deceased total, voiding and storage IPSS scores, increased peak urinary flow rate and deceased QoL-I. Inter-group difference was only observed on the storage domain of IPSS score (P = 0.012). The mean PVR after treatment did not significantly differ between two groups. Two patients of group 1 and three of group 2 developed acute urinary retention. Among group 1, six patients discontinued tolterodine ER for intolerable dry mouth; among group 2, three patients reported dizziness.

Conclusions

This longer comparative study indicated that additive treatment with tolterodine ER in older men with BPH/BOO and significant storage symptoms is a beneficial and safe therapeutic option.

Finasteride — symptom outcomes and counseling. Numerous robust analyses of randomized, placebo‑controlled trials have shown an improvement in standardized symptom scores superior to placebo, with improvements of 3 to 4 points observed and maintained for 6 to 10 years of follow‑up. Given the slow onset of action of this class, other medication classes may lead to more immediate relief, and patients should be counseled on a slower improvement in symptoms if men are treated with 5‑ARI alone.

1 INTRODUCTION

α 1 ‐Blockers have been used for the first‐line treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia ("LUTS/BPH"). 1, 2, 3, 4 These drugs may relieve voiding symptoms as well as storage symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 4 However, patients may still have persistent storage symptoms despite α 1 ‐blocker treatment. Anticholinergics in combination with α 1 ‐blockers have been reported to be effective in these cases. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Recently, it has been reported that mirabegron, a β3‐adrenoceptor (AR) agonist, was equally effective to anticholinergics for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), but has less side effects including dry mouth and constipation, and was more tolerable and cost‐effective than anticholinergics. 10, 11, 12 The open‐label add‐on study of mirabegron with α 1 ‐blocker (tamsulosin) was reported to be more effective than monotherapy with tamsulosin for the treatment of OAB induced by benign prostatic obstruction. 13

A phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (tadalafil) has recently been used for the treatment of "LUTS/BPH" 14, 15 However, there have been no studies on combination or add‐on therapies of tadalafil and β3‐AR agonist for the treatment of overactive bladder associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia ("BPH/OAB").

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of tadalafil and mirabegron have additive effect on OAB symptoms as compared to tadalafil monotherapy in patients who had remaining OAB symptoms after monotherapy with tadalafil.

Overactive bladder — dry mouth adverse event rates are quantified across placebo and drug arms, with meta-analysis showing placebo dry mouth at 6.90% (40 placebo arms; 95% CI: 5.6% to 8.5%). Rates in active drug treatment arms for darifenacin, fesoterodine, solifenacin, and trospium ranged from 20.0% to 40.0%, with no clear relationship between rate and dose; across medications, rates were statistically indistinguishable and interpreted as preliminary and descriptive. Comparative data indicate that oxybutynin (25 trial arms) had a dry mouth rate of 61.4% (95% CI: 52.5% to 69.5%), statistically significantly higher than tolterodine at 23.7% (95% CI: 20.7% to 26.9%) (p < 0.001), and although there was no clear relationship with dose, there was heterogeneity within each medication based on whether the immediate release (IR) or the extended release (ER) formulation was administered.

Patient-reported anejaculation and age-related trends — Anejaculation is noted by patients and may lead to dissatisfaction and treatment discontinuation. In the phase III silodosin studies, the number of men reporting EjD as an adverse event decreased from 46% to 11% for men in their 50s versus 70s, respectively, and the number of men discontinuing treatment due to the adverse events decreased from 4.7% to 0%. Based on these examples, it is reasonable to select alpha blockers with equal efficacy based on expected adverse events, and younger sexually active men are more likely to discontinue due to EjD; therefore, it would be prudent to select alpha blockers with a low incidence of EjD.

### Medications that cause dry mouth as an adverse effect in older people: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^114dzbpy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess and quantify the risk of drug-induced dry mouth as a side effect in older people.

Design

Systematic review and metaanalysis.

Setting

A search of the literature was undertaken using Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and PubMed from 1990 to 2016.

Participants

Older people (aged ≥ 60) who participated in intervention or observational studies investigating drug use as an exposure and xerostomia or salivary gland hypofunction as adverse drug outcomes.

Measurements

Two pairs of authors screened titles and abstracts of studies for relevance. Two authors independently extracted data, including study characteristics, definitions of exposure and outcome, and methodological quality. For the metaanalyses, random-effects models were used for pooling the data and I 2 statistics for exploring heterogeneity.

Results

Of 1,544 potentially relevant studies, 52 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the final review and 26 in metaanalyses. The majority of studies were of moderate methodological quality. In the intervention studies, urological medications (odds ratio (OR) = 5.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.04–8.63; I² = 62%), antidepressants (OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.69–8.32, I² = 21%), and psycholeptics (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.79–3.95, I² = 0%) were significantly associated with dry mouth. In the observational studies, numbers of medications and several medication classes were significantly associated with xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction.

Conclusion

Medication use was significantly associated with xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction in older adults. The risk of dry mouth was greatest for drugs used for urinary incontinence. Future research should develop a risk score for medication-induced dry mouth to assist with prescribing and medication management.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^117F2qSE]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with anti cholinergic properties

TCAs can cause symptoms such as constipation, blurred vision, dry mouth, and urinary retention. According to STOPP/START criteria, these drugs should be avoided in older adults with prostatism and/or prior history of urinary retention. Beer criteria also recommends against their use in geriatric patients because of anticholinergic properties and chances of causing orthostatic hypotension whereas AUA and EAU guidelines are silent over their use in older adults.

Antihistaminic drugs with anticholinergic properties

Antihistaminic (Brompheniramine/chlorpheniramine/cyproheptadine/diphenhydramine/hydroxyzine) and sympathomimetics (alpha-adrenergic-agents Ephedrine/phenylephrine/phenylpropanolamine/pseudoephedrine) are constituent of OTC cough syrup preparations. These drugs have the potential of precipitating acute retention of urine in older people suffering with BPH. According to a recent study conducted on 166,288 South Korean geriatrics, at least half were exposed to medications against recommendations of Beers Criteria. None of these guidelines recommend the use of these drugs in older adults.

Anti-muscarinic bronchodilators with anti cholinergic properties

Older adult are at higher risk for developing drug-induced urinary retention because of existing co-morbidities such as BPH and the use of other concomitant medication that could reinforce the impairing effect on micturition. The use of anti-muscarinic bronchodilators (ipratropium, tiotropium) in older adults with bladder outflow obstruction may precipitate urinary retention. Only STOPP/START guidelines recommend against use of these drugs in older adults. Other guidelines are silent on their use in geriatric patients.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^116rbKZH]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition, increasing with age and affecting quality of life. While numerous OAB drugs are available, persistence is low. We evaluated evidence published since 2012 to determine if newer drugs provided better efficacy and harm profiles.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 2012 to September 2018 using terms for included drugs and requested information from manufacturers of included drugs. We performed dual review of all systematic review processes, evaluated study quality, and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models.

Results

In addition to 31 older studies, we included 20 trials published since 2012 (N = 16,478; 4 good, 11 fair, and 5 poor quality). Where statistical differences were found, they were clinically small (reductions of < 0.5 episodes/day). Solifenacin plus mirabegron improved efficacy outcomes over monotherapy with either drug, but significantly increased constipation compared with solifenacin and dry mouth compared with mirabegron. Solifenacin reduced incontinence over mirabegron and tolterodine and urgency episodes over tolterodine. Mirabegron did not differ from tolterodine in efficacy but had significantly lower incidence of dry mouth than solifenacin or tolterodine. Fesoterodine showed significant improvements but also anticholinergic effects vs. tolterodine. Oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine had similar efficacy, but dry mouth led to greater discontinuation with oxybutynin. Blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, and dizziness were uncommon.

Conclusion

New evidence confirms small, but clinically uncertain, differences among monotherapies and also between combination and monotherapy, regardless of statistical significance. While drugs mainly differed in incidence of dry mouth or constipation, none provided improved efficacy without increased harms.

4 DISCUSSION

BPH is the histological terminology, and in itself does not require treatment and is not the target of therapeutic intervention. Although we are not sure that the term, "BPH/LUTS" is scientifically correct or not, this term is accepted terminology for the treatment of male LUTS by AUA. For the treatment of "LUTS/BPH", α‐blockers and/or PDE5‐inhibitors have been used as the first line of treatment. These drugs may improve storage symptoms, including OAB, as well as voiding symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15 However, OAB symptoms may remain despite these drugs. 5 In these patients, several combinations or add‐on therapies have been reported to be effective. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13

The most frequently used combination was α‐blocker and anticholinergic drugs, and these combinations can be effective for the treatment of "BPH/OAB" symptoms. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, addition of anticholinergics may cause several side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and voiding difficulty. Although rarely, these combinations may cause increase in PVR, and urinary retention may occur in about 1%‐3% of patients. 1, 5, 6

For the treatment of "LUTS/BPH" with large prostate (prostate volume > 30 mL), the combination of an α‐blocker and a 5α‐reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) has been reported to be more effective, even in the storage symptoms, compared to each monotherapy. 16, 17 However, the combination of α‐blocker, dutasteride, and anticholinergic drug has been reported to be more effective than the combination of α‐blocker plus dutasteride for the treatment of "BPH/OAB" with large prostate (DIrecT study). 18, 19

### Efficacy and safety of tolterodine and pilocarpine in patients with overactive bladder [^116J8kUr]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of 2 mg tolterodine and 9 mg pilocarpine, vs tolterodine monotherapy in patients with overactive bladder.

Materials and Methods

We enrolled patients with overactive bladder symptoms in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, active control study. Patients were randomized to the combination or 2 mg tolterodine twice daily for 12 weeks. After the double-blind period finished all patients were started on the combination for 12 weeks. Study co-primary end points were the change from baseline in the mean number of daily micturitions and cumulative incidence of dry mouth at the end of 12 weeks. Secondary end points were other overactive bladder symptoms, the total xerostomia inventory score and results of a visual analogue scale for dry mouth at the end of 12 and 24 weeks.

Results

The mean change in the number of daily micturitions from baseline to 12 weeks was -1.49 and -1.74 in the combination and tolterodine monotherapy groups, respectively. The mean difference was -0.26 (95% CI -0.79–0.27), confirming noninferiority. At 12 weeks the incidence of dry mouth was lower in the combination group than in the tolterodine monotherapy group (30.0% vs 42.9%, p = 0.009). All secondary and other efficacy outcomes related to overactive bladder symptoms improved in each group with no significant differences between the groups at 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in the total xerostomia inventory score and the visual analogue scale for dry mouth were significantly lower in the combination group than in the tolterodine monotherapy group.

Conclusions

Tolterodine and pilocarpine alleviated dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder while maintaining anticholinergic efficacy similar to that of tolterodine.

### The efficacy of mirabegron additional therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms after treatment with α ₁-adrenergic receptor blocker monotherapy: prospective analysis of elderly men [^112SQxn4]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to focus on the efficacy of mirabegron additional therapy in elderly male patients with OAB after monotherapy with α1-adrenergic receptor blockers. Our findings indicated that mirabegron additional therapy was effective for those whose OAB was not controlled with α1-adrenergic receptor blockers, according to the OABSS and IPSS. Our results also demonstrated that mirabegron had no suppressive effects on voiding function on uroflowmetry and PVR. In addition, regardless of the patient's age, mirabegron add-on therapy was considered effective and safe to take orally.

In elderly patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, an α1-adrenergic receptor blocker significantly improved LUTS, especially voiding dysfunction. However, some patients may continue to suffer from storage symptoms such as urgency and frequency. For these patients, some studies have suggested that combination therapy with an α1-adrenergic receptor blocker and anti-muscarinic drug is effective. However, because of the impaired physiological function of elderly people, anti-muscarinic drugs carry the risk for adverse events. In fact, there is a significant incidence of peripheral anti-muscarinic adverse events such as dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, cognitive dysfunction, and voiding dysfunction in elderly patients. Voiding dysfunction, in particular, due to male LUTS, might lead to excessive residual urine, urinary tract infection, and post-renal renal failure.

### Effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs compared with placebo in the treatment of overactive bladder: systematic review [^112Ssjet]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Published papers and abstracts.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials with anticholinergic drug treatment in one arm and placebo in another.

Data Extraction

Primary outcomes of interest were patient perceived cure or improvement in symptoms, differences in number of incontinent episodes and number of voids in 24 hours, and side effects. Secondary outcomes of interest were urodynamic measures of bladder function (volume at first contraction, maximum cystometric capacity, and residual volume) and adverse events.

Data Synthesis

32 trials were included, totalling 6800 participants. Most trials were described as double blind but were variable in other aspects of quality. At the end of treatment, cure or improvement (relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.54), differences in incontinent episodes in 24 hours (estimated mean difference 0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), number of voids in 24 hours (0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), maximum cystometric capacity (54 ml, 43 mL to 66 ml), and volume at first contraction (52 ml, 37 mL to 67 ml), were significantly in favour of anticholinergics (P < 0.0001 for all). Anticholinergics were associated with significantly higher residual volumes (4 ml, 1 mL to 7 ml; P = 0.02) and an increased rate of dry mouth (relative risk 2.56, 2.24 to 2.92; P < 0.0001). Sensitivity analysis, although affected by small numbers of studies, showed little likelihood of an effect of age, sex, diagnosis, or choice of drug.

Conclusions

Although statistically significant, the differences between anticholinergic drugs and placebo were small, apart from the increased rate of dry mouth in patients receiving active treatment. For many of the outcomes studied, the observed difference between anticholinergics and placebo may be of questionable clinical significance. None of these studies provided data on long term outcome.

β3 agonists for overactive bladder — side effects and hypertension warnings: Although not directly compared in studies, β3 agonists appear to have fewer side effects than antimuscarinic medications, particularly with lower rates of dry mouth and constipation, and likely have less effect on post-void residual (PVR) with decreased rates of retention/voiding dysfunction. For mirabegron, initial studies reported mild increases in systolic blood pressure of 1–3mm/Hg, although pooled phase 3 analyses suggest no significant differences in the incidence of hypertension between mirabegron, placebo, and tolterodine. Use guidance specifies, "Mirabegron is not recommended for use in patients with severe, uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180mm/Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110mm/Hg), while vibegron does not have this warning".

Fig. 3
Forest plot of change from baseline number of micturitions per 24 h at 8 to 12 weeks: mirabegron 50 mg vs. tolterodine extended release (ER) 4 mg

Pooling results from four short-duration RCTs showed a statistically significantly higher rate of dry mouth with tolterodine 4 mg than with mirabegron 50 mg (11.7% vs. 4.6%, Table 4). Higher incidence of dry mouth with tolterodine was also observed in the 52-week trial (8.6% vs. 2.8%). The incidence of cardiac arrhythmia was similar at 12 weeks in two trials (2.6% vs. 2.8%), but higher with tolterodine ER 4 mg at 12 months in a single trial (3.9% vs. 6.0%; P = 0.0547). However, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events (Table 4). Incidences of constipation, SAEs, and dizziness were similar between the drugs at both 8 to 12 weeks (Tables 4 and S6) and 52 weeks.

Fesoterodine vs. solifenacin

One fair-quality trial (N = 119) compared fesoterodine 4 mg per day with solifenacin 5 mg per day. The study reported only the OABSS for assessment of benefits. While fesoterodine and solifenacin each significantly improved scores from baseline at 12 weeks (−9.4 vs. −8.2) and achieved an MCID of 3 points, the difference between drugs was small and not statistically significant. Significantly more patients receiving fesoterodine compared with solifenacin withdrew because of adverse events (10.2% vs. 0.0%). Fesoterodine also resulted in higher incidence of constipation (5.1% vs. 1.7%) and dry mouth (13.6% vs. 5.0%), though differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.256 and P = 0.186, respectively). Other adverse events of interest were not reported.

### Outcome reporting in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the pharmacological management of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) in women; a systematic review for the development of core outcome sets (COS) [^113xp3PN]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the 38 RCTs analysed in this review, 25 studies clearly stated the primary outcome in the methods section (65.8%), whilst 23 studies declared the secondary outcomes (60.5%). Of studies that listed primary outcomes, five (13.2%) included more than one outcome. Three studies stated primary but not secondary outcomes (7.9%).

Quality of life was also assessed in over half of the studies (23 studies [60.5%]), either as a primary or a secondary outcome. Examples of QoL assessments included patient satisfaction, improvement in work productivity, change in quantity and quality of sleep and patient perspective on impact of the disease. However, in most trials the outcomes were outlined as changes from baseline to end-of-treatment in symptom-bother scores. Validated questionnaires were used in 29 studies (78.4%); the most commonly used were OAB-q and PPBC (assessed in 10 studies [26.3%]). Other questionnaires used included KHQ, the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI), Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire (N-QoL), Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QoL) and others. QoL related outcomes were identified as primary outcomes in 2 studies (5.3%).

Safety was assessed in 28 studies (73.7%) and was stated as a primary outcome in one study; this was primarily assessed as incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse effects (TEAEs). Other safety parameters were also assessed including side effects of antimuscarinics such as dry mouth and constipation, hypersensitivity reactions, hyponatraemia, cardiac effects, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, headaches, cognitive effects and death among others. Discontinuation rates were also documented in 13 studies (34.2%). Safety of the drugs used was monitored objectively and subjectively, through patients reporting side effects at clinic appointments, as well as through laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations and urinalyses among others.

Other outcomes assessed include changes to maximum flow rate, post-void residual volume, post-void dribbling, voiding efficiency, change from baseline to week 12 in transvaginal ultrasound bladder wall thickness and difference in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R) scores from baseline to week 4.

### The efficacy of mirabegron additional therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms after treatment with α ₁-adrenergic receptor blocker monotherapy: prospective analysis of elderly men [^115piyUp]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Upon further stratifying our study subjects according to age, our results suggested that voiding symptoms worsened slightly after treatment in the old-old patient group, but this difference was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that the use of mirabegron in elderly patients should be carefully monitored, especially in older patients.

The objective symptoms VV and Qmax on uroflowmetry were improved after treatment in patients overall. VV was particularly improved after treatment in young-old patients. However, objective symptoms did not change significantly in the old-old patient group. A previous pressure-flow study reported that mirabegron did not affect urinary bladder contraction even if older male patients were included in the analysis. However, these studies indicated that mirabegron therapy possibility increased PVR, although the change was not statistically significant. In our study, we obtained similar results for PVR. The older patients' voiding functions declined physiologically, and their initial PVR volume was higher than that of the younger patients. Although many clinicians think that mirabegron is associated with fewer problems in terms of voiding function than anti-cholinergic agents, it is necessary to consider changes in both the subjective and objective symptoms after treatment with mirabegron, especially in old-old patients.

In the present study, only three patients (6%) had mild adverse effects (2 patients, thirst; 1 patient, constipation), and all patients continued to take mirabegron during the study period. None of the patients with hypertension experienced worsening of their blood pressure level, although hypertension was well-controlled by medication or not severe in all cases in the present study. Hence, it appears that mirabegron can be used safely, and it has good tolerability. Previous studies have reported that typical adverse events such as dry mouth and constipation occurred at a similar incidence between mirabegron and placebo treatment. The incidence of dry mouth with mirabegron, in particular, is three- to four-fold lower than that with tolterodine. As noted in a meta-analysis, anti-muscarinic drugs are associated with a 29.6% incidence of dry mouth. As dry mouth is reported to be an important factor determining persistence, the favorable tolerability profile of mirabegron may result in improved treatment adherence compared with anti-muscarinic drugs, which has important implications for patient outcome. Many elderly people suffer from constipation and dry mouth; thus mirabegron may be convenient to administer in the elderly with OAB.

### Which anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder symptoms in adults [^111mbzHL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Around 16% to 45% of adults have overactive bladder symptoms (urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence - 'overactive bladder syndrome'). Anticholinergic drugs are common treatments.

Objectives

To compare the effects of different anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 8 March 2011) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook.

Main Results

Eighty six trials, 70 parallel and 16 cross-over designs were included (31,249 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind, but were variable in other aspects of quality. Crossover studies did not present data in a way that could be included in the meta-analyses. Twenty nine collected quality of life data (the primary outcome measure) using validated measures, but only fifteen reported useable data. Tolterodine versus oxybutynin: There were no statistically significant differences for quality of life, patient reported cure or improvement, leakage episodes or voids in 24 hours, but fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with tolterodine (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.66, data from eight trials), and less risk of dry mouth (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71, data from ten trials). Solifenacin versus tolterodine: There were statistically significant differences for quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.01, data from three trials), patient reported cure/improvement (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39, data from two trials), leakage episodes in 24 hours (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.08, data from four studies) and urgency episodes in 24 hours (WMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.13, data from four trials), all favouring solifenacin. There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events and dry mouth, but after sensitivity analysis the dry mouth (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94) was statistically significantly lower with solifenacin when compared to Immediate Release (IR) tolterodine. Fesoterodine versus extended release tolterodine: Three trials contributed to the meta analyses. There were statistically significant differences for quality of life (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.14), patient reported cure/improvement (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16), leakage episodes (WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.09), frequency (WMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.06) and urgency episodes (WMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.16) in 24 hours, all favouring fesoterodine, but those taking fesoterodine had higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.98) and higher risk of dry mouth (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.05) at 12 weeks. Different doses of tolterodine: The standard recommended starting dose (2 mg twice daily) was compared with two lower (0.5 mg and 1 mg twice daily), and one higher dose (4 mg twice daily). The effects of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses were similar for leakage episodes and micturitions in 24 hours, with greater risk of dry mouth with 2 and 4 mg doses at two to 12 weeks. Different doses of solifenacin: The standard recommended starting dose of 5 mg once daily was compared to 10 mg: while frequency and urgency were less (better) with 10 mg compared to 5 mg, there was a higher risk of dry mouth with 10 mg solifenacin at four to 12 weeks. Different doses of fesoterodine:The recommended starting dose of 4mg once daily was compared to 8 and 12 mg. The clinical efficacy (patient reported cure, leakage episodes, micturition per 24 hours) of 8 mg was better than 4 mg fesoterodine but with a higher risk of dry mouth with 8 mg. There was no statistically significant difference between 4 and 12 mg in the efficacy but the dry mouth was significantly higher with 12 mg at eight to 12 weeks. Extended versus immediate release preparations of oxybutynin and/or tolterodine: There were no statistically significant differences for cure/improvement, leakage episodes or micturitions in 24 hours, or withdrawals due to adverse events, but there were few data. Overall, extended release preparations had less risk of dry mouth at two to 12 weeks. One extended release preparation versus another: There was less risk of dry mouth with oral extended release tolterodine than oxybutynin (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95), but no difference between transdermal oxybutynin and oral extended release tolterodine although some people withdrew due to skin reaction at the transdermal patch site at 12 weeks.

Authors' Conclusions

Where the prescribing choice is between oral immediate release oxybutynin or tolterodine, tolterodine might be preferred for reduced risk of dry mouth. With tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily is the usual starting dose, but a 1 mg twice daily dose might be equally effective, with less risk of dry mouth. If extended release preparations of oxybutynin or tolterodine are available, these might be preferred to immediate release preparations because there is less risk of dry mouth. Between solifenacin and immediate release tolterodine, solifenacin might be preferred for better efficacy and less risk of dry mouth. Solifenacin 5 mg once daily is the usual starting dose, this could be increased to 10 mg once daily for better efficacy but with increased risk of dry mouth. Between fesoterodine and extended release tolterodine, fesoterodine might be preferred for superior efficacy but has higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events and higher risk of dry mouth. There is little or no evidence available about quality of life, costs, or long-term outcome in these studies. There were insufficient data from trials of other anticholinergic drugs to draw any conclusions.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^113SU48b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cumulatively, this systematic review update evaluated 51 head-to-head RCTs, including 20 newly identified trials. There were some statistically significant differences in efficacy between drugs but the absolute differences were small at less than half of an episode per day in key OAB outcomes (incontinence, urgency, and micturitions). The only exception was the combination of mirabegron 50 mg plus solifenacin 5 mg vs. either monotherapy on urgency episodes, where a significant difference was not found between drugs given as monotherapy, suggesting a synergistic effect. Overall, combination therapy significantly improved all efficacy outcomes assessed compared with either drug given alone. However, combination therapy also showed higher incidences of adverse events vs. monotherapy. The small potential benefit in key OAB outcomes with combination therapy should be weighed against increased risk of adverse events.

Solifenacin 5 mg showed greater improvement in incontinence and micturition frequency over mirabegron 50 mg and greater improvement in incontinence and urgency episodes over tolterodine 4 mg. There was no significant difference between mirabegron 50 mg and tolterodine 4 mg for any efficacy outcome. Patients' assessments of symptoms as measured by the OAB-q Symptom Bother score and/or the PPBC were in accordance with these numeric measures. Pooled mean differences in the OAB-q Symptom Bother score did not reach a minimal clinically important difference, further suggesting that differences between drugs are not likely to be of clinical significance.

Although mirabegron is not an anticholinergic drug, it exhibits some adverse effects similar to anticholinergics. Pooled analyses found no difference between mirabegron 50 mg and solifenacin 5 mg or tolterodine ER 4 mg related to blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, constipation, or dizziness. While incidence of dry mouth was significantly lower in patients who received mirabegron, this was not reflected in the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events. At 52 weeks, the difference in incidence of dry mouth between mirabegron and solifenacin was no longer significant, though a significant difference remained between mirabegron and tolterodine. When choosing between mirabegron and solifenacin, clinicians should consider their comparable safety profile but solifenacin's greater effectiveness on incontinence and micturition frequency.

### A randomized controlled trial evaluating low-intensity shockwave therapy for treatment of persistent storage symptoms following transurethral surgery for benign prostatic obstruction [^116GGiSC]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) is a common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men. LUTS, particularly storage symptoms, interfere with daily activities and negatively impact quality of life (QoL). After BPO surgery, 20–30% of patients still have persistent storage symptoms. Choi et al. found that persistent storage symptoms after transurethral resection of the prostate was significantly correlated to old age, small bladder capacity and poor detrusor contractility. Mitterberger et al. reported that 30% of patients who presented with preoperative detrusor overactivity (DO) had persistent DO after transurethral resection of the prostate and those patients had reduced bladder perfusion. The pathophysiology of persistent storage symptoms after BPO surgery remains unclear. It may be caused by bladder ischemia and denervation produced by long-standing BPO or it may be related to other factors such as aging, chronic inflammation or subtle neurological disorder.

Treatment with muscarinic receptor antagonists (MRAs) or ß3-agonizts is a common practice for storage LUTS after BPO surgery. However, these medications are associated with adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision after using MRAs or dizziness and blood pressure changes after using ß3-agonizts. After failure of non-invasive treatment, intravesical botulinum toxin-A injection might be considered. However, it may cause urinary tract infection and urine retention, and its effect decreases over time with the need of repeated injection.

Low-intensity shockwave therapy (Li-SWT) is a novel non-invasive treatment that has a beneficial effect in improvement of bladder function through induction of angiogenesis, restoration of nerve-ending integrity, suppression of DO and inhibition of inflammatory reactions. Moreover, it has been applied to the penis for erectile dysfunction and to the perineum for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome with encouraging results. Recent studies reported that Li-SWT had an important role in improvement of LUTS in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and amelioration of overactive bladder symptoms (OABS) in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).

Based on the forementioned studies, it has been proposed that Li-SWT can offer a benefit in improvement of persistent storage symptoms after BPO surgery.

The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of Li-SWT for control of persistent storage symptoms after transurethral surgery (TUS) for BPO compared to sham treatment and MRAs (solifenacin).

### Sexual side effects of medical and surgical benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments [^115iutRv]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia can be evaluated by multiple metrics. A balance within the confines of patient expectations is key to determining the ideal treatment. A troubling adverse event for some patients is sexual dysfunction. Because the cohort of men who seek treatment of sexual dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms is essentially identical, these disease processes frequently overlap. This article considers potential pathophysiologic causes of dysfunction with treatment and attempts to critically review the available data to assess the true incidence of sexual adverse events with treatment.

### Effects of branded versus generic terazosin hydrochloride in adults with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a randomized, open-label, crossover study in Taiwan [^116ftiJY]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Terazosin is an alpha1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent that has been reported in many clinical trials to be an effective choice for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To improve cost-effectiveness, the development of an effective and well-tolerated generic formulation is needed.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of branded versus generic terazosin hydrochloride in adult patients with symptomatic BPH in Taiwan.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study was conducted at the Urological Clinic, National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Taman, Taiwan. Men newly diagnosed with symptomatic BPH who had not previously received treatment for BPH were recruited between August 2002 and April 2006. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. Group A received generic terazosin during period 1 (6 weeks) and branded terazosin in period 2 (6 weeks); group B received the branded drug during period 1 and the generic during period 2. The 2 study periods were separated by a 1-week washout period. All treatments were given by mouth once daily (bedtime) at an initial dosage of 2 mg/d for the first 2 weeks. At the week-2 study visit in each treatment period, the dosage could be increased to 4 mg/d or decreased to 1 mg/d based on each patient's response and experience of adverse effects (AEs), based on the opinion of the investigator. Efficacy variables included the total score on the International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS), a 7-item instrument used to assess objective lower urinary tract symptoms, including quality of life. IPSS was measured at baseline and weeks 2 and 6 of each treatment period, and maximal and mean uroflow rates, measured at baseline and week 6. Tolerability was assessed at each time point using physical examination, including vital signs; laboratory analysis; and spontaneous reporting.

Results

Fifty-three patients were randomized; 43 were included in the efficacy analysis (mean [SD] age, group A, 64.5 [7.7] years and group B, 62.9 [8.2] years; mean [SD] weight, group A, 66.4 [7.2] kg and group B, 67.1 [8.9] kg; all patients were Taiwanese). At 2 and 6 weeks, no significant between-product differences were found in mean (SD) decreases from baseline in IPSS total score (generic, 2.46 [0.84] and 2.46 [1.00], respectively; branded, 1.56 [0.60] and 2.87 [0.71]). At week 6, the between-product difference in mean increase from baseline in maximal uroflow rate was nonsignificant (generic, 2.36 [0.90] mL/s; branded, 2.03 [0.62] mL/s). A total of 86 treatment-emergent AEs were reported (45 with the generic drug; 41 with the branded drug), all of which were considered by the investigator as nonserious except for 1 case of acute epididymitis, which occurred with the generic drug. The most common AEs reported with the generic and branded formulations were dizziness (7/48 [14.6%] and 10/50 [20.0%], respectively) and peripheral edema (1/48 [2.1%] and 3/50 [6.0%]). No significant differences in the prevalences of AEs were found between the 2 treatments.

Conclusion

In this group of Taiwanese patients with symptomatic BPH, the efficacy and tolerability of generic terazosin were similar to those of branded terazosin.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^117BjWfi]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — tadalafil randomized trials: Figure 3 reports 10 RCT with 3,754 participants, where the mean change in IPSS was -5.4 points with tadalafil versus -3.6 points with placebo for a mean difference of 1.74 lower, and this demonstrates that tadalafil results in little to no difference in mean change in IPSS compared to placebo. In data not shown, treatment responders defined as ≥ 3 points IPSS decrease in 281 participants (1 RCT) had RR 1.43 (1.13 to 1.80), suggesting that tadalafil probably greatly increases response to the IPSS compared to placebo. The BPH Impact Index exceeded the minimal detectable difference of 0.4 points (MD: -0.6 points; 95%CI: -0.81, -0.37), while nocturia frequency showed little to no difference (MD: -0.13 times per night; 95%CI: -0.26, 0.01). Overall withdrawals were 8% with tadalafil and 9% with placebo (IRR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.77, 1.16; [ARD: -0.5%; 95%CI: -2.2, 1.3]), and withdrawals due to adverse events were 3% versus 2% (IRR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.02, 2.62); [1%; 95%CI: 0.3, 2.1]. Adverse events were higher with tadalafil, 26% versus 22% ([RR 1.22; 95%CI: 1.09, 1.37] [ARD: 5%; 95%CI: 2, 8]; Number Needed to Harm [NNH] 20), with headache, nasopharyngitis, and back pain most commonly reported; totals for the figure were Tadalafil = 1,877 and Placebo = 1,877 with I2 = 0%.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) background — histology, androgen pathway, and prevalence: BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation of glandular epithelial tissue, smooth muscle, and connective tissue within the prostatic transition zone. The mechanism by which testosterone exerts many of its physiological effects on the prostate gland is through dihydrotestosterone (DHT); once intracytoplasmic, testosterone is converted to its active metabolite DHT by the enzyme 5 α -reductase, type 2, and DHT forms a complex with androgen receptors that is then transported to the nucleus where the complex exerts its effects on the transcription of DNA. BPH is nearly ubiquitous in aging males, with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at age 40–45 years to reach 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80, and while BPH, or histological hyperplasia, in and of itself does not require treatment.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of medical treatments for the management of overactive bladder: a systematic literature review and mixed treatment comparison [^111WoHR1]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment guidelines recommend antimuscarinics as ﬁrst-line pharmacologic therapy. Mirabegron is a first-in-class β3-adrenoceptor agonist licensed for the treatment of OAB and has shown to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of OAB symptoms.

Objective

To assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of OAB medications, specifically mirabegron 50 mg versus antimuscarinics in patients with OAB.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic literature search was performed on published peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to 2013. This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying changes in symptoms (micturition frequency, incontinence, and urgency urinary incontinence [UUI] episodes) and incidence of the most frequently reported adverse events (dry mouth, constipation) associated with current OAB medications. The following drugs were considered in addition to mirabegron: darifenacin, tolterodine immediate release (IR) and extended release (ER), oxybutynin IR/ER, trospium, solifenacin, and fesoterodine. Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) were performed for efficacy (micturition, incontinence, UUI) and tolerability (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision).

Evidence Synthesis

Overall, 44 RCTs involving 27,309 patients were included. The MTCs showed that mirabegron 50 mg was as efficacious as antimuscarinics in reducing the frequency of micturition incontinence and UUI episodes, with the exception of solifenacin 10 mg that was more efficacious than mirabegron 50 mg in improving micturition frequency and frequency of UUI. Mirabegron 50 mg had an incidence of dry mouth similar to placebo and significantly lower than all included antimuscarinics.

Conclusions

Mirabegron 50 mg had similar efficacy to most antimuscarinics and lower incidence of dry mouth, the most common adverse event reported with antimuscarinics and one of the main causes of discontinuation of treatment. Despite being a powerful tool for evidence-based health care evaluation, the Bayesian MTC method has limitations. Further head-to-head comparisons between mirabegron and antimuscarinics should be conducted to confirm our results.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^111uJzJS]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder — antimuscarinic adverse effects and counseling: "Clinicians should counsel patients with OAB on the side effects of all oral medication options; treatment should be chosen based on side effect profiles and in the context of shared decision-making". While efficacy may be similar among medications, side effect profiles differ among agents and between antimuscarinics and β3 agonists. Antimuscarinic risks include dry mouth reported by approximately 25% to 44% of patients with, compared to placebo, a relative risk of 3.50, (95% CI: 3.26–3.75); constipation commonly reported by 8–15% with a relative risk (RR) of 2.03 (95% CI: 1.78–2.31); voiding dysfunction/incomplete emptying occurring in approximately 16% (95% CI: 8–27) of women taking oxybutynin with antimuscarinics associated with a RR of 3.52 (95% CI: 2.04–6.08) of retention; and blurred vision in up to 11% with a RR of 1.58, (95% CI 1.26 to 1.99) compared to placebo. Although rare, antimuscarinic use can be associated with palpitations, tachycardia, and QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia, and ER formulations are superior to immediate release formulations for decreasing side effects and should be used preferentially.

### Safety and tolerability of solifenacin add-on therapy to α-blocker treated men with residual urgency and frequency [^113ybf1K]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

VICTOR was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial assessing the safety and tolerability of solifenacin plus tamsulosin in men with residual overactive bladder symptoms after tamsulosin monotherapy. Efficacy of solifenacin plus tamsulosin vs placebo plus tamsulosin was also evaluated.

Materials and Methods

A total of 398 men 45 years old or older were randomized to 12 weeks of solifenacin plus tamsulosin or placebo plus tamsulosin once daily. The study population had 8 or more micturitions per 24 hours and 1 or more urgency episode per 24 hours after taking tamsulosin for 4 or more weeks, a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 13 or greater, a Patient Perception of Bladder Condition score of 3 or greater, a post-void residual of 200 mL or less and a peak flow rate of 5 mL per second or greater. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. The primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline to week 12 in micturitions per 24 hours. Secondary measures included mean change in urgency episodes per 24 hours, and changes in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Urgency Perception Scale and total International Prostate Symptom Scores.

Results

The most frequent adverse events in the solifenacin plus tamsulosin and placebo plus tamsulosin groups were dry mouth (7% and 3%, respectively) and dizziness (3% and 2%, respectively). Of the patients on solifenacin plus tamsulosin 7 (3%) reported retention and 3 required catheterization. No patients on placebo plus tamsulosin reported retention. Patients on solifenacin plus tamsulosin vs placebo plus tamsulosin showed larger reductions in frequency but not of statistical significance (-1.05 vs -0.67, p = 0.135). However, patients on solifenacin plus tamsulosin vs placebo plus tamsulosin did show statistically significant reductions in urgency (-2.18 vs -1.10, p < 0.001). Patient reported outcome measures showed no significant between group differences.

Conclusions

Solifenacin plus tamsulosin was well tolerated. There was a low incidence of urinary retention requiring catheterization. At week 12 solifenacin plus tamsulosin decreased daily micturitions and urgency episodes. Only urgency reached statistical significance vs placebo plus tamsulosin.

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111wi7wJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4–26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49, -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3, -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59, 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65, 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg-0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha reductase inhibitors — gynecomastia: The multinational 4‑year REDUCE trial found an increased incidence of gynecomastia (1.9% versus 1.0%; ARD: 0.8; 95%CI: 0.3, 1.3), with a larger between‑group difference in the post hoc analysis of a subset of 1,617 men (2.4% versus 0.7%; ARD: 1.7; 95%CI: 0.5, 2.9). During the 2‑year observational extension phase conducted in 2,751 participants, no new cases of gynecomastia were reported. Conversely, a 2‑year study conducted in Asia did not demonstrate any increased risk of gynecomastia in men on dutasteride, and an observational study reported a greater incidence of gynecomastia in men who used finasteride or dutasteride, alone or with an alpha blocker, when compared to non‑exposure to LUTS/BPH medications.

### Combination therapy only shows short-term superiority over monotherapy on ureteral stent-related symptoms-outcome from a randomized controlled trial [^1148bBCC]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Means of scores of flank pain (a), bladder pain (b) and urgency (c). Effect on flank pain started showing up from day5 to the end (p = 0.006) and solifenacin is comparable to tamsulosin and combination therapy (p = 0.914 vs 0.195) (a). Combination therapy released bladder pain and urgency throughout the whole follow-up (comparing with the control, both p < 0.001) (b and c). Before day4, Solifenacin and tamsulosin had no significant effect on bladder pain (p = 0.589 vs 0.936) or urgency (p = 0.806 vs 0.729) but both showed showed comparable effectiveness as the combination therapy from day5 to day14 (b and c)

Solifenacin, tamsulosin and combination group all showed no superiority over the control group in hematuria (p = 0.736 & 0.924 & 1.000) or frequency (p = 0.073 & 0.860 & 0.092) (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Incontinence was observed on only two follow-up days from one single case in solifenacin group.

As for quality of life (QoL), significant difference existed among the 4 groups (p = 0.046) but combination therapy wasn't superior to either monotherapy group (solifenacin and tamsulosin, p = 0.107 vs 0.670). Medication therapy groups had higher scores than the control at the beginning but finally went down to be lower after day4 (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Adverse events

Main complications of drug therapy groups were as followed: solifenacin group with three patients with dry mouth (3/26, 11.5%); tamsulosin group with two with dizziness (2/22, 9.1%), combination group with three with dry mouth and one with both symptoms in group (4/24, 16.7%). The total incidence rate of adverse events from these three groups and no significant differences (p = 0.727). No serious adverse events were reported throughout the study.

AUA/SUFU OAB side-effect management and patient education — Many side-effects can be managed effectively, and clinicians can help patients benefit from OAB pharmacotherapy by proactively monitoring and managing common side-effects. Before even initiating OAB pharmacotherapy, patients should be educated about the possible effects of medication on bowel function and the roles of adequate dietary fiber and fluid intake, psyllium-based fiber supplements, regular exercise, and normal bowel habits, and management of dry mouth might include advice on oral lubricants, avoiding mouthwashes with alcohol, taking small sips of water, sucking on sugar-free hard candies, and chewing sugar free gum. The Panel felt assessment after initiating OAB therapy was important to avoid medical "purgatory", and those who do not achieve appropriate improvement should be offered change in therapy.

### A prospective, double-blind, randomized, two-period crossover, multicenter study to evaluate tolerability and patient preference between mirabegron and tolterodine in patients with overactive bladder (PREFER study) [^111mNnZ6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

> Both treatments were well tolerated. The statistically significant difference in favor of mirabegron for anticholinergic TEAEs, and more specifically, gastrointestinal disorders, was predominantly because of the difference in the frequency of dry mouth between patients receiving mirabegron (9.1%) and those receiving tolterodine ER (16.3%). Dry mouth was assessed in two ways: the first via unsolicited spontaneous reporting as an adverse event, as done in all pharmaceutical trials, and the second as a specific response item of the OAB-S Medication Tolerability scale. The difference in the methods of capture, spontaneous versus solicited, likely explains the large discrepancy in the rates of dry mouth reported in this study (i.e. 9.1% and 43.5% for mirabegron vs 16.3% and 55.5% for tolterodine ER) between the two methodologies. However, both methods were directionally consistent with substantially more reports of dry mouth among patients receiving tolterodine ER. There were no clinically meaningful increases in blood pressure among patients receiving mirabegron or tolterodine ER and the magnitude of the increases was similar to those reported in other studies. The higher incidence of TEAEs in period 1 across all sequences suggests that adverse events might be experienced shortly after starting treatment or that patients became tolerant and reported adverse events less frequently in period 2. The magnitude of improvements in OAB symptoms, response rates and incidence of TEAEs are consistent with those reported with mirabegron and tolterodine ER monotherapy in phase III studies.

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of trospium chloride demonstrated that urinary frequency and urge incontinence can be reduced significantly with a flexible dosing strategy. Dose adjustment may improve the therapeutic outcome in some patients, facilitating the definite balance between the efficacy and anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth. In comparison to the adjusted dose of oxybutynin which is officially approved, the adjusted dose of trospium was proven to be at least as well tolerated, safe and efficient.

Evidence includes four randomized, placebo-controlled, well-executed studies, two non-controlled studies, and one randomized study with poorly defined methods assessing pre-surgical 5-ARIs; one randomized and two non-randomized studies showed a reduction in blood loss or transfusion requirements, while other studies found no significant differences between treatment and placebo for blood loss during surgery, excessive or severe bleeding, or clot retention, and the prescriber and patient should consider medication side effects prior to deciding to move forward with pre-surgical 5-ARI treatment.

Patients with medical risk factors

A number of other medical conditions are associated with dry eye; collagen vascular disease, refractive surgery, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, vitamin A deficiency and androgen insufficiency have high levels of evidence for an association with dry eye, while diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, systemic chemotherapy, some types of cataract surgery, keratoplasty, sarcoidosis and ovarian dysfunction are also candidate risk factors with at least moderate evidence. Dry eye can also be iatrogenic; there is at least moderately strong evidence showing antihistamines, some antidepressants, diuretics and beta-blockers as risk factors for dry eye. While cancer itself is not a risk factor for dry eye, radiation therapy and some types of systemic chemotherapy are.

Similarly, MGD has been associated with a number of medical treatments including antihistamines, antidepressants, antiandrogens and isotretinoin drugs used for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. The degree of overlap between those drugs identified as potential risk factors for dry eye and those associated with MGD is notable. The list of medical conditions that may be associated with MGD is long, but includes androgen deficiency, atopy (and perhaps associated antihistamine use), benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, menopause, Parkinson's disease, rosacea, Sjögren's syndrome and others.

Clearly, there is a wide range of medical conditions and medical treatments that put patients at increased risk of OSD. Many of these conditions are more prevalent among older patients and, therefore, frequently comorbid with glaucoma. Avoiding preservatives in the glaucoma medication of patients already at risk of OSD because of pre-existing medical conditions or those that develop during the course of their glaucoma treatment would seem to be the responsible course of action.

Presurgical patients

Trabeculotomy or filtration surgery is a common procedure used in patients in whom topical glaucoma therapy does not adequately control IOP or in those who fail to tolerate topical medication sufficiently well. A link between impaired outcome of trabecular surgery and long-term topical therapy has long been suspected. The role of toxic effects of preservatives in precipitating inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the ocular surface is now well recognized and some of the mechanisms have been elucidated.–It would thus seem reasonable that patients in whom filtration surgery might become indicated in the future be spared the additional risk of a poor surgical outcome by using preservative-free, rather than preservative-added medication in the initial stages of their illness.

The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice.

6-Month to 1-Year Trials

The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 2,663 patients. SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1,308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dosage of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected.

The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention.

### Tolerability of 5 mg solifenacin once daily versus 5 mg oxybutynin immediate release 3 times daily: results of the VECTOR trial [^115u6Vwm]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although antimuscarinic treatment is indicated for overactive bladder, many patients discontinue it because of dry mouth. Of available antimuscarinics oxybutynin is associated with the highest dry mouth rate. We compared the safety and tolerability of 5 mg solifenacin vs 15 mg oxybutynin immediate release.

Materials and Methods

At 12 Canadian centers a total of 132 patients with overactive bladder symptoms (greater than 1 urgency episode per 24 hours, and 8 or greater micturitions per 24 hours) were randomized to 5 mg solifenacin once daily or 5 mg oxybutynin 3 times daily for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the incidence and severity of dry mouth reported after direct questioning. Efficacy end points (3-day diary documented changes in urgency, frequency, incontinence, nocturia and voided volume), and changes on the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition scale and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire were evaluated secondarily.

Results

Of patients on solifenacin vs oxybutynin immediate release 35% vs 83% reported dry mouth (p < 0.0001). Of patients reporting dry mouth severity was graded moderate by 13% and 42% of those on solifenacin and oxybutynin immediate release, and severe by 13% and 28%, respectively (p = 0.001). Patients in each group showed improvements in efficacy end points, and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition scale and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire scores from baseline to treatment end.

Conclusions

Significantly fewer patients on 5 mg solifenacin once daily reported dry mouth vs those receiving 5 mg oxybutynin immediate release 3 times daily. Significantly fewer patients on solifenacin reported moderate/severe dry mouth. Significantly fewer patients on solifenacin withdrew from study due to dry mouth and there were significantly fewer overall adverse events. Solifenacin and oxybutynin immediate release were efficacious in decreasing efficacy end points, and improved Patient Perception of Bladder Condition scale and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire results from baseline to treatment end.

Discussion

Safety and efficacy of tolterodine Er

Tolterodine ER vs. Tolterodine IR

Tolterodine intermediate release (IR) was firstly developed and tested in several randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study which led to drug approval by the FDA in 1998. The efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine IR and oxybutynin IR were found to be comparable. Dry mouth was the only adverse event that occurred significantly more often in patients treated with tolterodine IR (1 mg bid, 30%; 2 mg bid, 48%) in comparison to patients of the placebo group; however, only 3% of the tolterodine IR treated subjects withdrew from treatment because of dry mouth.

Regardless of the positive results of the registration trials and confirmation of the excellent efficacy in randomised phase IV studies, Pfizer laboratories developed an extended release (ER) formulation (approved by the FDA in 2000) to improve patient compliance and to decrease the dry mouth rate which was thought to be dependent from the peak plasma levels of the drug. Tolterodine ER uses a drug delivery system that contains soluble microspheres. The drug is slowly released as the outer layer of the microsphere dissolves, leading to consistent delivery of drug over a 24-hour period.

The efficacy and tolerability of tolterodine ER have been evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo controlled study in 1529 patients with OAB. A significant clinical advantage in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability was associated with tolterodine ER treatment. A 71% mean reduction in urgency incontinence episodes was found in the tolterodine ER group compared to a 60% reduction in the tolterodine IR group (p < 0.05). The incidence of dry mouth was 23% for tolterodine ER versus 30% for tolterodine IR. The overall rate of dry mouth was 23% lower with tolterodine ER than with tolterodine IR. The incidence of other adverse events such as dizziness (ER 2% vs. IR 2%), constipation (ER 7% vs. IR 6%) and somnolence (ER 3% vs. IR 3%) were similar between the treatment groups and comparable with placebo. This pivotal study suggested an improved clinical advantage of tolterodine ER over the IR formulation of the drug in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

### Tolterodine tartrate (Detrol) [^113k6mVF]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for DETROL Tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with DETROL (N = 2133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism.

The data described below reflect exposure to DETROL 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates.

Sixty-six percent of patients receiving DETROL 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving DETROL were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents.

Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with DETROL and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with DETROL discontinued treatment due to dry mouth.

The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of DETROL were dizziness and headache.

Three percent of patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^112Gf7A7]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) initial medical therapy — trial duration and next-step evaluation are specified as follows: "An initial trial of medical management over 4 weeks with an alpha blocker or PDE5, and over 6–12 months with a 5-ARI is reasonable in men with bothersome LUTS". "Referral to a specialist is recommended for men who either do not improve with medical management, or have symptomatic improvement but intolerable medication-related side effects". If "initial medical management does not lead to symptomatic improvement", clinicians should consider "performance of studies, such as urodynamics, to confirm BOO versus DO", noting that "Understanding the contribution of DO versus BOO can aid in patient counseling and in the selection of additional medication options". In men "with LUTS predominantly due to BPH", "procedural or surgical options may be considered", whereas in "complicated LUTS… additional medication classes should be considered along with procedural options".

Transdermal/topical oxybutynin adverse events — Dmochowski (2002) reported dry mouth rates of 8.3% with placebo, 4.6% with 1.3 mg TDS oxybutynin, 6.6% with 2.6 mg and 9.6% with 3.9 mg and constipation rates of 3.0% with placebo, 5.4% with 1.3 mg, 2.3% with 2.6 mg and 0.8% with 3.9 mg. Dmochowski (2003) reported dry mouth rates of 4.1% with 3.9 mg TDS oxybutynin, 7.3% with tolterodine and 1.7% with placebo, with constipation rates 3.3% with 3.9 mg and 5.7% with tolterodine. Davila (2001) reported dry mouth rates of 38% in the TDS group compared to 94% in the oral oxybutynin group. Cartwright (2010) reported that 38.2% experienced erythema or pruritus versus 27.1% with placebo and 14.9% experienced at least one systemic adverse event versus 12.5% with placebo. Staskin (2009) reported dry mouth of 6.9% with gel versus 2.8% with placebo and other adverse events at 1% or less in both groups.

### Anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder… [^111QW3WT]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which anticholinergic drug regimen is most effective for overactive bladder. Evidence-Based Answer Tolterodine is as effective as immediate-release oxybutynin and causes less dry mouth. A dose of 1 mg tolterodine twice daily is as effective as higher dosages of tolterodine. Extended-release preparations have less risk of dry mouth but are more expensive. Options for treatment include nonpharmacologic approaches such as adjusting urine output to 1 to 1. 5 L daily, urge-suppression training, bladder retraining, and prompted voiding. Drug treatments include oxybutynin, tolterodine, propantheline, dicyclomine, and tricyclic antidepressants. 1 In a 2002 Cochrane review, 2 Hay-Smith and colleagues determined that, compared with placebo, anticholinergic medications produce a statistically significant improvement in symptoms.

To determine which anticholinergic medication regimen is most effective, Hay-Smith and colleagues searched for randomized controlled trials that compared anticholinergic drugs in adults with overactive bladder symptoms. The two most studied drugs were oxybutynin and tolterodine. In studies comparing the abilities of tolterodine and oxybutynin in reducing leakage episodes and micturitions, the two drugs were similar in effect. However, patients receiving tolterodine were less likely to withdraw because of adverse events and had one half to one third the risk of dry mouth. In addition, 1 mg of tolterodine twice daily was as effective as the more standard dosage of 2 mg twice daily and caused fewer adverse effects. Limited data showed extended-release preparations were equally as effective as immediate-release preparations with fewer adverse effects.

Tolterodine and oxybutynin are available in the following forms: tolterodine immediate-release, 1- and 2-mg capsules; tolterodine extended-release, 2- and 4-mg capsules; oxybutynin immediate-release, 5-mg tablets and 5-mg syrup; oxybutynin extended-release, 5-mg tablets and a transdermal patch that delivers 3. 9 mg daily.

### Oxybutynin in the treatment of urge incontinence… [^1171AcJd]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Oxybutynin has been used for years in the treatment of urinary incontinence. This medication has been effective in reducing the frequency and total number of incontinent episodes. One of the most common anti-cholinergic side effects of immediate-release oxybutynin is dry mouth, which is one of the main reasons patients stop taking this medication. Anderson and colleagues studied the efficacy and safety of the new controlled-release oxybutynin compared with the immediate-release formula. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted at 13 study centers. Patients with a history of urge incontinence or mixed incontinence with a primary urge component who experienced at least six urge incontinent episodes per week when not taking medications were eligible to participate in the study. Of the 158 patients screened, 105 were enrolled. Participants were randomized at each study site into one of two double-line treatment groups.

One group received controlled-released oxybutynin starting at a dosage of 5 mg per day and titrated upward to a maximum dosage of 30 mg per day. The other group received the immediate-release formula at a dosage of 5 mg, one to four times per day. The discontinuation rate was similar in both groups; only a few were related to adverse side effects. The mean number of weekly urge incontinent episodes, the total number of incontinent episodes and the percentage of reduction in weekly urge incontinent episodes were similarly reduced by the controlled-release and immediate-release oxybutynin. Fewer side effects occurred in the controlled-release group compared with the immediate-release group. The major difference between the two groups was in the number of patients who complained of moderate to severe dry-mouth symptoms. Controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin were effective in treating urge incontinence.

Continence was obtained across the entire dosage range; therefore, patients should be individualized for this therapeutic regimen. Dosages over 20 mg per day of the controlled-release oxybutynin did not dramatically increase the effectiveness of this medication; thus, higher dosages are not necessary for the majority of patients. The authors conclude that controlled- and immediate-release oxybutynin were effective in treating urge urinary incontinence. The controlled-release formula produced less dry-mouth side effects.

### Contribution of common medications to lower urinary tract symptoms in men… [^116FeMuF]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Medication use varied by race/ethnicity, with more Asian participants using antihistamines and African Americans using proportionately more diuretics. Medication use increased with age, particularly for bronchodilators, anticholinergics, and diuretics, with a highest rise in diuretic use from 8% to 23% in participants aged 45 to 49 years to 70 to 74 years, respectively. In unadjusted analyses, every medication class was associated with LUTS. When adjusted for region, age, and race/ethnicity, bronchodilators and antidepressants had the strongest associations with adjusted ORs of 1. 22 and

1. 39, respectively. The cohort was then stratified by presence of BPH, with 14 215 participants having BPH. Significant associations were found more often among men without BPH, particularly for sympathomimetic, diuretic, and antidepressant medications. When study medications were combined into any vs none, the OR was 1. 29 without adjustment for BPH and
2. 28 with adjustment for BPH. When stratified by presence of BPH, the OR was 1. 31 for those without BPH and
3. 16 for those with BPH. Estimates of etiologic fraction suggest that antihistamines, bronchodilators, diuretics, and antidepressants account for approximately 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% of LUTS, respectively. These percentages were slightly attenuated in men with BPH. Use of any of these medications could account for 10% of LUTS, compared with 29% of symptoms associated with BPH. This study documents the association between specific categories of common medications and LUTS in a large, diverse population of community-dwelling men. If the observed associations represent cause and effect relationships, these medications account for 10% of LUTS, an effect approximately one-third of that for BPH. This underscores the importance of assessing medications in the differential diagnosis of LUTS.

### Dry mouth with oxybutynin therapy… [^115RZ47c]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

After initial assessment, the patients were randomly assigned to treatment with immediate-release or controlled-release oxybutynin, beginning with a dosage of 5 mg per day. The dosage was increased by 5 mg per day every seven days until the optimal balance was obtained between control of incontinence and tolerability of side effects. The maximal dosage was 20 mg per day. Once the optimal dose was established, it was maintained for at least one week. Patients kept symptom diaries and records of urinary incontinence episodes. The 111 patients randomized to treatment with controlled-release oxybutynin were comparable in all important variables to the 115 patients randomized to receive immediate-release oxybutynin. Overall, the average age of patients was 59 years; most were white and female. Seven patients in each group discontinued medication, but only one patient cited dry mouth as contributing to this decision. Both treatments were highly effective.

The number of urge incontinence episodes decreased by 83 percent in the patients treated with controlled-release oxybutynin and by 76 percent in the patients who received immediate-release oxybutynin. Two other patients left the study. The overall rates of dry mouth for the two groups were not significantly different:

47. 7 percent for the patients given the controlled-release formulation and
59. 1 percent for those given the immediate-release preparation. The cumulative proportion of patients reporting moderate or severe dry mouth was dose-dependent and was higher at each dosage for the immediate-release preparation: 5 mg per day, 3. 6 percent for the controlled-release formulation and
7. 0 percent for the immediate-release formulation; 10 mg per day, 8.
5. percent for the controlled-release formulation and
25. 6 for the immediate-release formulation; 15 mg per day, 19. 4 percent for the controlled-release formulation and
38.

9 percent for the immediate-release formulation; and 20 mg per day, 39. 5 for the controlled-release formulation and 45 percent for the immediate-release formulation. The authors concluded that moderate to severe dry mouth is a common, dose-related side effect of oxybutynin therapy. The precise mechanism by which controlled-release oxybutynin preparations may reduce dry mouth symptoms is unknown. The lower rates associated with these preparations may be related to metabolism in the colon rather than the small intestine.
