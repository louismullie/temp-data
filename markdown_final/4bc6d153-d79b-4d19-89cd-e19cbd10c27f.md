## Question

14 weeks pregnant shiikd they be on lithium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether taking lithium at 14 weeks' gestation is appropriate, how to balance maternal relapse prevention against fetal and neonatal risks, and what monitoring or adjustments are needed for safe management through delivery and postpartum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's individual bipolar disorder history and relapse risk on and off lithium. Then, I should verify how gestational timing at 14 weeks affects teratogenic risk. Next, I will quantify fetal and neonatal risks from lithium continuation and weigh them against maternal risks of discontinuation. After that, I should review pregnancy-related pharmacokinetic changes, dose targets, and monitoring. Then, I need to plan for delivery and the immediate postpartum period, consider alternatives to lithium, and incorporate shared decision-making. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation for 14 weeks and outline postpartum and lactation considerations [^114ph6bz] [^1177veaM] [^115q3sH7] [^111TPjZo].

> Let me first confirm the individualized clinical context, because the net benefit of lithium continuation hinges on prior illness severity, unique efficacy of lithium for this patient, and perinatal relapse risk, especially postpartum psychosis risk where lithium has strong preventive effects [^114ph6bz] [^114AVoxx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if lithium has been uniquely effective in preventing mania, mixed states, or suicidality, discontinuation may be disproportionately risky compared with alternatives that are less effective for the manic pole or that require slow titration, so I need to check prior response patterns and relapse history around pregnancies or postpartum periods before changing therapy [^114Rshji] [^114ph6bz].

> Next, I should review gestational timing, because at 14 weeks the patient is at the start of the second trimester and most cardiac organogenesis is complete, which lowers the biologic plausibility of new major structural cardiac teratogenesis from lithium compared with true first-trimester exposure windows [^112kJ8Vv]. Wait, let me verify remaining concerns; later-pregnancy lithium exposure still raises issues around fetal growth, neonatal adaptation, thyroid effects, and perinatal toxicity that are modifiable with dosing and monitoring rather than absolute contraindications at this stage [^112yghSi] [^1122f9Tz].

> I will now examine fetal and neonatal risks of continuation to quantify them carefully. Meta-analytic data suggest a roughly threefold relative increase in major cardiac malformations with in utero lithium, but the absolute risk rises from about 0.8% to approximately 2%, with Ebstein's anomaly remaining rare, so I should confirm that we communicate absolute numbers rather than only relative risks during counseling [^115q3sH7]. But wait, what if neonatal toxicity is more level-dependent than exposure-dependent; the peripartum data indicate placental equilibrated transfer and higher neonatal complications when maternal or cord levels exceed about 0.64 mEq/L, supporting tighter peripartum control rather than blanket discontinuation far in advance of labor [^113PG81R] [^111oNZHj].

> Hold on, I should verify the maternal risks of discontinuation, because that is often underestimated; prospective cohort data show a 71% overall recurrence risk in pregnancy, with risk far higher after abrupt or rapid discontinuation and a marked shortening of time-to-relapse, predominantly into depressive or mixed episodes that carry significant morbidity and suicide risk, which argues against stopping lithium at 14 weeks without a compelling reason and a slow taper plan if chosen [^111TPjZo]. Let me reconsider the timing detail; although nearly half of recurrences occur in the first trimester, the hazard after abrupt discontinuation remains clinically relevant at 14 weeks, so abrupt cessation now would still be high risk for relapse, especially if the preconception course was unstable [^111TPjZo] [^114Ma5CU].

> Next, I should review pregnancy physiology and therapeutic drug monitoring, because renal clearance of lithium increases by roughly 30–50% in pregnancy, often necessitating dose adjustments to maintain efficacy while favoring the low therapeutic range to mitigate fetal exposure and perinatal toxicity [^1177veaM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought of the standard adult maintenance target of 0.6–1.0 mEq/L, but in pregnancy many clinicians aim lower, around 0.4–0.8 mEq/L for prevention, balancing maternal stability and neonatal safety, noting that although this range is supported in other lithium-treated conditions and offers a reasonable lower bound, targets must be individualized and interpreted with clinical response, not levels alone [^111kb9BW] [^1177veaM]. I need to ensure supportive measures and labs are in place, including counseling on hydration, avoiding NSAIDs and diuretics, and checking lithium levels about every 4 weeks until late third trimester and then weekly, with trimesterly thyroid and renal function, because maternal and neonatal hypothyroidism and dehydration-related toxicity are preventable with vigilance [^1177veaM] [^112Mjnm1].

> I will now examine delivery planning, and I need to check the evolving evidence versus labeling recommendations. Traditional labeling advises dose reduction or discontinuation 2–3 days before anticipated delivery to reduce maternal and neonatal toxicity, but observational data suggest brief holds lead to only modest maternal level reductions and that stable dosing through labor may not worsen neonatal outcomes, especially when preventing maternal postpartum relapse is paramount, so I should present both approaches transparently and tailor the plan to relapse risk and obstetric logistics [^1177veaM] [^116mZCcp]. Let me verify neonatal monitoring needs; because cord and maternal levels are closely correlated and higher neonatal levels associate with transient hypotonia and other adaptation issues, planning for cord level checks and 48–72 hours of neonatal observation with attention to tone, feeding, respiration, glucose, and thyroid status is prudent regardless of the chosen peripartum dosing strategy [^113PG81R] [^111oNZHj] [^112Mjnm1].

> Let me consider alternatives, but hold on, I should verify their risk-benefit profiles at 14 weeks for a patient already stable on lithium. Valproate is clearly teratogenic and should be avoided unless no acceptable alternatives exist, which generally rules it out here, while lamotrigine has a more favorable reproductive safety profile but is slower to titrate and less robust for mania prevention, and atypical antipsychotics can be helpful but raise metabolic and obstetric risks such as gestational diabetes and LGA, so a forced mid-pregnancy switch introduces new uncertainties that may not outperform known lithium response in this patient [^114YdrSk] [^11787GEc] [^11371WDC].

> Next, I should review how to conduct shared decision-making with precision, using absolute risks and documenting values and preferences. Let me first confirm the key numbers to communicate: absolute cardiac malformation risk around 2% with lithium versus 0.8% baseline, higher risks of LGA and spontaneous preterm birth in observational cohorts, and neonatal adaptation risks that scale with maternal levels, set against a roughly 70% risk of relapse with discontinuation during pregnancy, particularly if abrupt, which often outweighs the incremental fetal risks when lithium uniquely prevents severe mood episodes [^115q3sH7] [^112yghSi] [^111TPjZo]. I need to ensure coordinated care with obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatrics, emphasize hydration and avoidance of interacting drugs, and remind that most lithium-exposed pregnancies result in healthy infants, which can help contextualize decisions and support adherence to monitoring plans [^1122f9Tz] [^114ph6bz] [^1177veaM].

> Putting this together for 14 weeks, my recommendation, after verifying the above, is to continue lithium at the lowest effective dose with vigilant monitoring, because the highest teratogenic window for structural cardiac anomalies has passed and the maternal relapse risk from discontinuation remains substantial, while modifiable neonatal risks can be mitigated with level control and delivery planning [^112kJ8Vv] [^111TPjZo]. I should double-check that dose adjustments maintain efficacy in the lower therapeutic window, arrange serum level checks about every 4 weeks with an increase in frequency in late third trimester, monitor TSH, free T4, creatinine, and electrolytes each trimester, schedule a detailed anatomy scan at 18–20 weeks with careful cardiac views for reassurance, and coordinate a delivery plan including neonatal observation and laboratory support for glucose and thyroid screening [^1177veaM] [^112oCYog].

> But wait, what if the patient strongly prefers discontinuation and has a very low recurrence risk profile; in that limited scenario, discontinuation may be considered with a slow taper over at least 4 weeks under close psychiatric follow-up, avoiding abrupt cessation to reduce relapse risk, and with contingency plans to reintroduce treatment if prodromal symptoms recur, which I should make explicit in the consent process [^111TPjZo]. I should confirm ongoing nonpharmacologic supports and ensure rapid-access care if mood symptoms emerge during the taper or postpartum, when risk is highest [^111TPjZo].

> Finally, I need to think about postpartum and lactation because relapse risk peaks shortly after delivery and lithium has a role in prophylaxis. I should confirm that resuming the preconception dose promptly once medically stable postpartum, with early level checks as vascular volume normalizes, can reduce relapse risk, and that breastfeeding may be considered with careful infant monitoring for hydration, lithium level when clinically indicated, and thyroid function, acknowledging shared decision-making around benefits and risks and the need for close pediatric follow-up [^1177veaM] [^113PG81R]. Hold on, I should verify postpartum psychosis prevention; lithium has the strongest evidence base for relapse prevention in the immediate postpartum and should be prioritized in high-risk patients with clear monitoring protocols and family education in place [^114AVoxx].

In select cases, lithium can be continued at **14 weeks** if the patient has **severe bipolar disorder** and alternatives are ineffective, but use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring [^114ph6bz]. The **absolute risk of cardiac malformations is low** but higher than unexposed [^115q3sH7] [^112kJ8Vv], and **lithium crosses the placenta** [^113PG81R], so monitor maternal levels, renal and thyroid function, and fetal growth [^115zwJ5V]. If continued, **reduce or stop lithium 24–48 hours before delivery** to limit neonatal exposure, and restart postpartum with monitoring [^1177veaM] [^113PG81R].

## Risks associated with lithium use at 14 weeks gestation

Lithium **crosses the placenta** [^113PG81R], resulting in fetal exposure to maternal levels and increasing the risk of congenital malformations, especially cardiac defects such as Ebstein's anomaly [^112kJ8Vv]. The **absolute risk is low** but higher than in unexposed pregnancies [^115q3sH7] [^112kJ8Vv].

- **Cardiac malformations**: Lithium exposure is associated with a small increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly [^112kJ8Vv].
- **Neonatal complications**: Lithium exposure near delivery can cause neonatal toxicity, including hypotonia, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties [^111oNZHj].
- **Maternal complications**: Lithium use during pregnancy can cause maternal toxicity, including renal and thyroid dysfunction [^115zwJ5V] [^111Zj2qv].

---

## Benefits of continuing lithium therapy during pregnancy

Lithium is **effective for preventing relapse** in bipolar disorder [^114ph6bz], and **discontinuation increases relapse risk** [^111TPjZo], including postpartum psychosis [^114AVoxx]. Continuing therapy can **reduce relapse risk** and support **maternal stability**, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes [^111qLDyJ] [^112kJ8Vv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **individualized decisions** about lithium use in pregnancy, balancing maternal stability with fetal risk [^112kJ8Vv] [^114ph6bz]. If continued, use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring [^112kJ8Vv].

- **Dose adjustments**: Monitor serum lithium and adjust dose as renal clearance increases in pregnancy [^1177veaM] [^114Ma5CU].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor renal and thyroid function [^115zwJ5V], and fetal growth throughout pregnancy [^116CwpJz].
- **Delivery management**: Reduce or stop lithium 24–48 hours before delivery to limit neonatal exposure, and restart postpartum with monitoring [^1177veaM] [^113PG81R].

---

## Alternative mood stabilizers

Alternative mood stabilizers such as **lamotrigine** and certain antipsychotics may be considered; however, each has distinct risks and benefits [^11787GEc]. Lamotrigine has a **lower risk of congenital malformations** than lithium but may be **less effective for mania** [^111eEZW5] [^11787GEc].

---

## Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes

Limited data suggest **no significant long-term neurodevelopmental differences** in children exposed to lithium in utero, but more research is needed [^116MQqbf] [^115cvYSV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lithium use at 14 weeks gestation should be **individualized**, balancing maternal stability with fetal risk. If continued, use the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring. If discontinued, **taper gradually** and consider alternatives [^114ph6bz].

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114ph6bz]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bipolar disorder, particularly in pregnant patients, the 2023 DoD/VA guidelines recommend considering continued treatment with lithium at the lowest effective dose. This should be done within a framework that includes psychoeducation and shared decision-making for patients with bipolar disorder who are or might become pregnant and are stabilized on lithium.

### Lithium carbonate [^1177veaM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to reduce neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery, with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations].

### Lithium carbonate [^112kJ8Vv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lithium may cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, especially for Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. Subsequent case-control and cohort studies indicate that the increased risk for cardiac malformations is likely to be small; however, the data are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk. There are concerns for maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period [see Clinical Considerations]. Published animal developmental and toxicity studies in mice and rats report an increased incidence of fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, increased fetal skeletal abnormalities, and cleft palate (mouse fetuses only) with oral doses of lithium that produced serum concentrations similar to the human therapeutic range. Other published animal studies report adverse effects on embryonic implantation in rats after lithium administration. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored.

### Risk of recurrence in women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy: Prospective study of mood stabilizer discontinuation [^111TPjZo]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This study estimated the risk of recurrence of mood episodes among women with a history of bipolar disorder who continued or discontinued treatment with mood stabilizers during pregnancy.

- **Method**: In a prospective observational clinical cohort study, the authors determined recurrence risk and survival-analysis-based time to recurrence of a new episode in 89 pregnant women with DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Eligible subjects were euthymic at conception and continued mood stabilizer treatment or discontinued treatment proximate to conception.

- **Results**: The overall risk of at least one recurrence in pregnancy was 71%. Among women who discontinued versus continued mood stabilizer treatment, recurrence risk was twofold greater, median time to first recurrence was more than fourfold shorter, and the proportion of weeks ill during pregnancy was five times greater. Median recurrence latency was 11 times shorter after abrupt/rapid versus gradual discontinuation of mood stabilizer. Most recurrences were depressive or mixed (74%), and 47% occurred during the first trimester. Predictors of recurrence included bipolar II disorder diagnosis, earlier onset, more recurrences/year, recent illness, use of antidepressants, and use of anticonvulsants versus lithium.

- **Conclusions**: Discontinuation of mood stabilizer, particularly abruptly, during pregnancy carries a high risk for new morbidity in women with bipolar disorder, especially for early depressive and dysphoric states. However, this risk is reduced markedly by continued mood stabilizer treatment. Treatment planning for pregnant women should consider these findings.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^112yghSi]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To account for the impact of underlying psychiatric illness on perinatal outcomes, we performed two subgroup analyses. Both were planned a priori. First, we compared the same outcomes among women with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis who were either prescribed lithium or not.

Second, we compared women who had used lithium during pregnancy to those who had used lithium prior to pregnancy but not in the 3 months prior to conception or during pregnancy.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^115wiQxJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic and episodic severe mental disorder, often requiring continuous mood-stabilising treatment to prevent relapses and lower the risk of suicide. Lithium, certain anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics are recommended as mood stabilisers in bipolar disorder. Knowledge about the consequences of treatment with mood stabilisers during pregnancy is, however, limited.

Antipsychotics during pregnancy have been associated with congenital malformations, preterm birth, and abnormal fetal growth. In a recent study, however, we could not confirm an association between antipsychotics during pregnancy and abnormal fetal growth, except for an increased risk of macrocephaly after the use of clozapine or olanzapine. Furthermore, antipsychotics, regardless of type, were associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes. Lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine have been associated with congenital malformations, but for lithium, the data are conflicting and difficult to interpret. Some authors suggest lithium as the first-line treatment of choice for bipolar disorder during pregnancy, whereas others have recommended avoiding this drug.

Having bipolar disorder has been linked to slightly increased risks of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, and giving birth to small-for-gestational-age infants. However, previous studies did not assess drug treatment, and to our knowledge, no attempts have been made to differentiate between the influences on potential adverse effects of the illness itself, use of drugs, associated adverse lifestyle behaviors, and comorbidities.

### Anticonvulsant mood stabilizer and lithium use and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [^113zt18v]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The objective is to determine the comparative safety of mood stabilizers concerning the risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, growth restriction, and preterm birth.

- **Methods**: A cohort study was carried out using Medicaid Analytic eXtract data for pregnant women linked to live-born infants enrolled from 2000 to 2010. Exposure to lamotrigine, valproate, topiramate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and lithium during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was assessed. The reference group did not fill a prescription for an anticonvulsant or lithium during the 3 months before conception or the first half of pregnancy. Women who continued mood stabilizer monotherapy after 20 weeks were also compared to those who discontinued. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with propensity score stratification to control for confounding.

- **Results**: Among 1,472,672 pregnancies, 10,575 (0.7%) were exposed to anticonvulsant mood stabilizer or lithium monotherapy, and 917 (0.06%) were exposed to polytherapy. In unadjusted analyses, exposure to each specific mood stabilizer and polytherapy was associated with increased risks of all adverse outcomes compared to no exposure (RR ranged from 1.15 to 1.56). However, these RR estimates were not meaningfully elevated with adjustment for confounding (0.89 to 1.16). Continuation of mood stabilizers was not associated with an increased risk for any outcomes compared to discontinuation and was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption and growth restriction.

- **Conclusions**: Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers and lithium are not associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Exposure to lithium and cesium through drinking water and thyroid function during pregnancy: A prospective cohort study [^111Zj2qv]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

This study provides the first indication that exposure to lithium and cesium through drinking water may adversely affect thyroid function during pregnancy. In particular, increasing blood lithium concentrations were associated with higher serum TSH, but also lower fT3, total T3, and transthyretin levels. The quantile regression models indicate that the women in the lowest percentiles of TSH and highest percentiles of T3 are more susceptible to lithium. An unexpected secondary finding is the inverse association between cesium, which also occurred at highly varying concentrations in the drinking water, and both fT3 and T3.

One previous study from Buenos Aires, on the east coast of Argentina, presumably with a very low water lithium concentration, reported median TSH concentrations of 0.95, 1.5, and 1.6 mIU/L in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. This is similar to the observed concentrations in our study, particularly in the first lithium tertile (1.3, 1.7, and 1.8 mIU/L, respectively). Our results on lithium exposure and thyroid function are in agreement with previous studies, although most of those concerned lithium medication, which results in much higher blood lithium concentrations (therapeutic range 0.8–1.2 mmol/L). A recent meta-analysis and a retrospective cohort study of clinical studies on lithium therapy showed that lithium therapy is associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism. In support of a low-dose effect at the population level, we previously observed a positive association between lithium exposure through drinking water.

### Valproate sodium [^114YdrSk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including valproate sodium, during pregnancy. Women who are taking valproate sodium during pregnancy should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1–888–233–2334 or visiting the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Enrollment must be done by the patient herself.

- **Risk summary**: For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)]. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue the medication abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus, resulting in maternal and fetal hypoxia, posing a threat to life.

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects such as spina bifida, as well as malformations involving other body systems (e.g. craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent.

### Treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy [^114Rshji]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy, or in women who wish to conceive, poses a unique set of dilemmas with which clinicians should be familiar. Given the teratogenicity of some psychotropic medications used to treat bipolar disorder and incomplete reproductive safety data for agents frequently employed to manage the illness, patients and clinicians should collaborate as they weigh options regarding appropriate pharmacologic therapy during pregnancy. Ultimately, risk-benefit decisions must factor in the risk of relapse of psychiatric illness during pregnancy and its attendant morbidity versus the risk of fetal exposure to these agents. No clinical decision is risk-free. Patients with comparable information about risks and benefits of treatment options may make different decisions.

Awareness of the latest reproductive safety data across the family of compounds used to treat bipolar disorder, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anticonvulsants, allows for the most informed decisions. This article describes the treatment dilemmas faced by bipolar women who are either pregnant or who wish to conceive, reviews the teratogenic risks associated with commonly used psychotropic medications, and provides some clinical guidelines for treating this population during pregnancy.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1122f9Tz]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A prespecified statistical analysis plan was generated prior to analyses and agreed upon by the authors. Characteristics of the population were described according to lithium use during pregnancy. Lithium users and non-users were compared via bivariate analysis using Pearson's Chi-squared test for categorical data and Student's t-test for continuous variables.

The average treatment effect for lithium-treated women (average treatment effect on the treated) on adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes was estimated using Stata's 'teffects' command and presented as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals; within-mother clustering was accounted for in standard errors. Regression models were inverse probability weighted to achieve covariate balance between exposure groups.

A propensity score for exposure was calculated for each individual using a logistic regression that included variables considered likely confounders based upon directed acyclic graphs and selected a priori for inclusion in the propensity score models. Included covariates were maternal age (35 years), body mass index (30 kg/m²), smoking status, country of birth, education, parity, maternal psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia and psychosis, with an interaction term between these), other medical conditions (such as diabetes and hypertension) and medications such as antipsychotics (ATC code N05A), central stimulants (ATC code N06BA), or lamotrigine (ATC code N03AX09) dispensed during or 3 months prior to pregnancy.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^1156Sj5V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The results of the multiple regression analyses on birth weight and gestational duration are presented in Table 3. Lithium use during pregnancy was significantly associated with an average increase in birth weight of 142.43 grams (95% CI: 58.01, 226.89). In addition, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with gestational duration, with an average decrease of 1.41 weeks (95% CI: −1.78, −1.05). Results of the binary logistic regression analyses showed that lithium use during pregnancy was associated with large for gestational age (LGA) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.12) and premature birth (adjusted OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.86, 5.74).

In the sensitivity analyses, no association of bipolar spectrum disorder with 20 weeks' fetal growth, birth weight, and gestational duration was found. The results of our analyses did not change when we limited the analyses to one pregnancy per mother, when all pregnancies before the year 2002 were removed from the analyses, and when pregnancies with gestational diabetes were removed from the lithium group.

### SPL drug information for lithium carbonate ER [^114WP25T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium carbonate ER PO (also known as Lithobid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor the thyroid function of the neonate and to check for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. In humans, lithium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from lithium birth registries suggest an increase in cardiac and other anomalies, especially Ebstein's anomaly. If this drug is used in women of childbearing potential, or during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed by their physician of the potential hazard to the fetus.

### Peripartum lithium management: Early maternal and neonatal outcomes [^111oNZHj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that a 30–50% lithium dose reduction or lithium discontinuation 24–48 hours before delivery could minimize neonatal complications. We investigated the maternal lithemia changes around delivery following a brief discontinuation, the placental transfer of lithium at delivery, and the association between neonatal lithemia at delivery and acute neonatal outcomes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a teaching hospital between November 2006 and December 2018. Data was extracted from the medical records. We included psychopathologically stable women with a singleton pregnancy, treated with lithium in late pregnancy, with at least one maternal and neonatal lithemia at delivery. Lithium was discontinued 12 hours before a scheduled caesarean section or induction, or on the day of admission for a hospital birth; it was restarted 6–12 hours postpartum.

- **Results**: Sixty-six mother-infant pairs were included, and 226 maternal and 66 neonatal lithemias were obtained. We found slight maternal lithemia fluctuations close to 0.20 mEq/L, and an early postpartum relapse rate of 6%. The mean (SD) umbilical cord/mother intrapartum lithemia ratio was 1.10 (0.17). Fifty-six percent of neonates presented transient acute complications, with neonatal hypotonia being the most frequent outcome (N = 15). Mean lithemia levels were 0.178 mEq/L higher in those with hypotonia than in those without (p = 0.028).

- **Limitations**: This is a retrospective cohort of a moderate sample size of healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies, and the results cannot be generalized to all pregnancies treated with lithium.

### Pregnancy outcome following in utero exposure to lithium: A prospective, comparative, observational study [^112oCYog]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). High credibility.

The authors conducted a prospective, comparative observational study to evaluate the risk of major anomalies following exposure to lithium during pregnancy.

A total of 183 lithium-exposed pregnancies of women who contacted the Israeli Teratology Information Service were followed up (90.2% in the first trimester) and compared with 72 disease-matched and 748 nonteratogenic-exposed pregnancies.

There were significantly more miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.08–3.48) and elective terminations of pregnancy (17/183 [9.3%] compared with 15/748 [2.0%]) in the lithium-exposed group compared with the nonteratogenic exposure group. The rate of major congenital anomalies after exclusion of genetic or cytogenetic anomalies was not significantly different between the three groups (lithium-exposed in the first trimester: 8/123 [6.5%]; bipolar: 2/61 [3.3%]; nonteratogenic: 19/711 [2.7%]).

- **Cardiovascular anomalies**: Occurred more frequently in the lithium group exposed during the first trimester when compared with the nonteratogenic exposure group (5/123 [4.1%] compared with 4/711 [0.6%]), but not after excluding anomalies that spontaneously resolved (3/123 [2.4%] compared with 2/711 [0.3%]). Ebstein's anomaly was diagnosed in one lithium-exposed fetus and in two retrospective lithium cases that were not included because contact with the information service was made after the prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound.

- **Noncardiovascular anomalies**: The rate was not significantly different between the groups.

The rate of preterm deliveries was higher in the lithium-exposed group but the content cuts off before the comparison is completed.

### Case report and review of the perinatal implications of maternal lithium use [^115CrcqY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to review the use of lithium in pregnancy and its effects on the neonate. This was a case study and review of the published literature. Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar depression. Bipolar disorders that require treatment with lithium demand special consideration when the woman becomes pregnant.

Reported neonatal problems with maternal lithium therapy include Ebstein's anomaly, poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypotonia and lethargy, hyperbilirubinemia, and large-for-gestational-age infants. Lithium can have adverse effects on the fetus and newborn infant, but data suggest normal behavioral patterns in childhood.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^114yKn4J]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Use of lithium during pregnancy is associated with a 2–3-fold increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth, birth of a large-for-gestational-age infant, and cardiac malformations. It is important to note that the absolute risk of malformations remained low. Lithium use may also be associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. However, lithium was not associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia or birthing a small-for-gestational-age infant.

These findings should be weighed against the need to effectively manage maternal psychiatric illness during pregnancy. They should also be used to guide shared treatment decision-making and appropriate surveillance for those on treatment during pregnancy.

### The effect of prenatal lithium exposure on the neuropsychological development of the child [^116MQqbf]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by episodes of depression and hypomania or mania. Lithium is the most effective maintenance treatment and is also well established during the acute phase of the disease. As the onset of bipolar disorder is often in early adulthood, lithium is frequently prescribed to women of childbearing age and may be continued during pregnancy. An important reason to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy is that it reduces the risk of a recurrent mood episode during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, lithium crosses the placenta freely, resulting in fetal serum levels equaling that of the mother. For well-informed, balanced decision-making, more information on the potential fetal impact is needed.

Most research has focused on the teratogenicity of lithium, investigating the incidence of congenital malformations in lithium-exposed infants. Recently, two large studies have confirmed the results of previous smaller studies, reporting that lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. However, this effect was smaller than previously estimated. Some other studies have reported an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, increased birth weight, and neonatal admissions.

### Maternal and infant outcomes associated with lithium use in pregnancy: An international collaborative meta-analysis of six cohort studies [^115q3sH7]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Concerns about teratogenicity and maternal and offspring complications restrict the use of lithium during pregnancy for the treatment of mood disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between in-utero lithium exposure and the risk of pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations.

- **Methods**: In this meta-analysis, primary data from pregnant women and their children from six international cohorts based in the community (Denmark, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada) and in clinics (The Netherlands, UK, and USA) were analyzed. Pregnancies were eligible for analysis if the pregnancy resulted in a liveborn singleton between 1997 and 2015, if health-related information was available for both mother and infant, and if the mother had a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) or if she had been given lithium during pregnancy (at least two dispensations of lithium during pregnancy that were dispensed any time from 1 month before conception until delivery, or a single lithium dispensation during pregnancy when there was at least one other lithium dispensation within 6 months before or after this date). Pregnancies during which the mother had been prescribed known teratogenic drugs were excluded. Pregnancies were grouped into a lithium-exposed group and a mood disorder reference group.

- **Outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth, and congenital malformations (major malformations and major cardiac malformations).

Regarding the medical management of peripartum depression, specifically concerning the use of antidepressants, the SIGN 2012 guidelines recommend monitoring for alterations in fetal growth in patients taking antipsychotics during pregnancy. Additional monitoring for blood glucose abnormalities is advised when olanzapine or clozapine are used.

### SPL drug information for lithium citrate [^112Mjnm1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium citrate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is advised to avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans.

- **Thyroid function monitoring**: Monitor the thyroid function of the neonate.

- **Lithium toxicity monitoring**: Monitor neonates for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries have suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, especially for Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. Concerns exist for maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period. If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored, and the dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Two to three days prior to delivery, lithium dosage should be decreased or discontinued to reduce the risk of maternal and/or neonatal toxicity.

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: An observational study [^116mZCcp]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Recommendations on lithium dosing around delivery vary, with several guidelines suggesting that lithium should be discontinued prior to delivery. We aimed to evaluate the validity of these recommendations by investigating: 1) maternal lithium blood level changes following delivery, and 2) the association between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included women with at least one lithium blood level measurement during the final week of pregnancy and the first postpartum week. For aim 2, we included a subcohort of women with neonates for whom neonatal lithium blood levels (obtained from the umbilical cord or a neonatal vein puncture within 24 hours of delivery) were available.

A total of 233 maternal lithium blood level measurements were recorded; 55 (23.6%) in the week before delivery and 178 (76.4%) in the week after. There was no association between time and lithium blood level/dose ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.03, P = 0.63). Additionally, we included a total of 29 neonates for whom a lithium measurement was performed within 24 hours postpartum. Maternal and neonatal lithium blood levels were strongly correlated. We observed no associations between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

Based on our findings, we do not recommend lowering the dosage or discontinuation of lithium prior to delivery. Stable dosing can prevent subtherapeutic lithium serum levels, which is especially important in the postpartum period.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^117WisN2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Lithium is currently the most effective drug for relapse prevention and is widely used as a first-line treatment in bipolar spectrum disorder. It has beneficial treatment effects during both depressive and manic episodes, is associated with a reduction in suicide risk, and is highly effective for relapse prevention. Because the onset of bipolar disorder often occurs before the age of 25 years, lithium is frequently prescribed to women of childbearing age. Women with bipolar disorder who continue lithium use during pregnancy have a lower risk of relapse, both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

Although lithium has clear beneficial effects for the mother, it may have unintended consequences for the developing fetus. Lithium is known to pass the placenta completely, meaning the fetus is exposed to the same level of lithium as the pregnant woman. Intrauterine lithium exposure has been associated with increased risks of congenital malformations, but the risk is low. Moreover, lithium has been associated with spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and increased neonatal birth weight in some studies, although other studies refute these findings. Importantly, to our knowledge, no information is available relating maternal lithium therapy during pregnancy to fetal growth patterns. An environmental study showed an effect of lithium exposure through drinking water on fetal growth. Studying the effects of intrauterine exposure to lithium on fetal development is especially important because the intrauterine environment impacts fetal programming.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^116CwpJz]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Lithium is prescribed during pregnancy, but there is limited information about pregnancy and neonatal outcomes following in utero exposure. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the associations between lithium use and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

- **Methods**: This population-based cohort study examined associations between maternal lithium use and major adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes via inverse probability weighted propensity score regression models.

- **Results**: Of 854,017 women included in this study, 434 (0.05%) used lithium during pregnancy. Among pre-specified primary outcomes, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (8.7% vs 3.0%; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.82, 3.82) and birth of a large for gestational age infant (9.0% vs 3.5%; aRR 2.64, 95% CI 1.91, 3.66), but not preeclampsia nor birth of a small for gestational age infant. Among secondary outcomes, lithium use was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations (2.1% vs 0.8%; aRR 3.17, 95% CI 1.64, 6.13). In an analysis restricted to pregnant women with a diagnosed psychiatric illness (n = 9552), associations remained between lithium and spontaneous preterm birth, birth of a large for gestational age infant, and cardiovascular malformations; and a positive association with neonatal hypoglycemia was also found. These associations were also apparent in a further analysis comparing women who continued lithium treatment during pregnancy to those who discontinued prior to pregnancy.

Conclusions: Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with several adverse outcomes.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^111ZZBoS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Descriptive statistics and analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 24, IBM). The association of prenatal lithium exposure with fetal growth measurements and birth weight was analyzed using separate multiple linear regression analyses. Models for fetal growth and birth weight were adjusted for the following covariates: maternal age, maternal BMI, gestational age at the time of measurement, parity, smoking, and psychotropic medication use other than lithium (i.e. a combined covariate for the use of drugs for depression, psychosis, and insomnia/anxiety). Additionally, the model for birth weight was adjusted for the sex of the child.

Interactions between the covariates and lithium use were tested for significant improvements in model fit. Quadratic and cubic terms for gestational age were tested for significant improvement of the model fit. Models for gestational age at birth were adjusted for maternal age, maternal BMI, parity, smoking, and psychotropic medication use other than lithium.

In order to compare our results with previous studies and assess clinical relevance, we additionally calculated odds ratios for preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) and large for gestational age (LGA) (i.e. a birth weight above the 90th percentile of birth weight by gestational age and sex), using binary logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios were adjusted for the same covariates as previously described. All continuous covariates were centered to improve interpretation. Missing data in the covariates were handled using appropriate statistical methods.

Lithium use

Different types and various compounds of lithium were utilized during the study. The most commonly prescribed form was lithium carbonate, known commercially as Camcolit® and Priadel®. Another preparation used was lithium citrate, sold as Litarex®. In 60 pregnancies, women used lithium carbonate (Camcolit® n = 37, Priadel® n = 19, and other brands of lithium carbonate, n = 4). Lithium citrate was used in 38 pregnancies. In the remaining 21 pregnancies, the specific lithium medication prescribed was unknown. The average daily dosage of lithium during pregnancy was 1007 mg, divided over approximately 2.8 doses per day. For conversion purposes, lithium citrate dosages (Litarex 564 mg = 6 mmol lithium) were multiplied by 0.395 to calculate the equivalent dosage of lithium carbonate (400 mg = 10.8 mmol lithium). Maternal lithium plasma levels during pregnancy were available for 88 pregnancies, with the mean lithium level close to the time of ultrasound recorded as 0.44 mmol/L.

- **Fetal growth measurements**: Pregnancy exposure to lithium was significantly associated with an average increase in most fetal growth parameters at 20 weeks of gestation. This included a head circumference (HC) increase of 1.77 mm (95% CI: 0.53, 3.01), an abdominal circumference (AC) increase of 5.54 mm (95% CI: 3.95, 7.12), a femur length (FL) increase of 0.59 mm (95% CI: 0.22, 0.96), and an estimated fetal weight increase of 21.05 grams (95% CI: 12.29, 29.81). There was no association found between lithium use and transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurements (β: 0.13, 95% CI: −0.11, 0.36).

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^112Kaja2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Regarding other pre-specified primary outcomes, lithium use was associated with a higher risk of birthing a large for gestational age infant, with a crude relative risk of 2.59 (95% CI 19.2, 3.50; 9.0% vs 3.5%) and an adjusted relative risk of 2.64 (95% CI 1.91, 3.66; 9.0% vs 3.5%). There was no association between lithium use and preeclampsia (3.5% vs 2.8%; aRR 1.01 [95% CI 0.59, 1.73]) or birth of a small for gestational age infant (3.0% vs 2.3%; aRR 1.05 [95% CI 0.54, 2.06]).

Among secondary outcomes across the whole population, no associations were found between lithium use and macrosomia (defined as birthweight > 4500 g; 21.4% vs 18.6%; aRR 1.05 [95% CI 0.25, 4.32]), neonatal hypoglycaemia (5.5% vs 2.5%; aRR 1.46 [95% CI 0.89, 2.40]), a 5-min Apgar score < 6 (2.5% vs 1.3%; aRR 0.92 [95% CI 0.38, 2.22]), total malformations (4.4% vs 3.4%; aRR 1.41 [95% CI 0.90, 2.23]) or perinatal death (0.5% vs 0.5%; aRR 1.08 [95% CI 0.15, 7.67]). However, a higher incidence of neonates with cardiac malformations was observed among women who used lithium (2.1% vs 0.8%), with an aRR of 3.17 (95% CI 1.64, 6.13) and, of these, the majority (66.6%) were reported as malformations of the cardiac septa (ICD-10 Q21).

### Brain development after intrauterine exposure to lithium: A magnetic resonance imaging study in school-age children [^115cvYSV]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Lithium is often continued during pregnancy to reduce the risk of perinatal mood episodes for women with bipolar disorder. However, little is known about the effect of intrauterine lithium exposure on brain development. This study aimed to investigate brain structure in children after intrauterine exposure to lithium.

- **Methods**: Participants were offspring, aged 8–14 years, of women with a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder. A total of 63 children participated in the study: 30 with and 33 without intrauterine exposure to lithium. Global brain volume outcomes and white matter integrity were assessed using structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. Primary outcomes included total brain, cortical and subcortical gray matter, cortical white matter, lateral ventricles, cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala volumes, cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and global fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. To compare our data with the general population, global brain volumes were analyzed against the Generation R study (N = 3243).

- **Results**: In our primary analyses, we found no statistically significant associations between intrauterine exposure to lithium and structural brain measures. There was a non-significant trend toward reduced subcortical gray matter volume. Compared to the general population, lithium-exposed children showed reduced subcortical gray and cortical white matter volumes.

- **Conclusion**: We found no differences in brain structure between lithium-exposed and non-lithium-exposed children aged 8–14 years.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^115iFWqV]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes for women with bipolar disorder, both treated and untreated, during pregnancy. The design was a population-based cohort study using data from national health registers in Sweden.

The participants included 332,137 women who had their last menstrual period after 1 July 2005 and gave birth before the end of 31 December 2009. Women with at least two records of bipolar diagnoses were grouped as treated (n = 320) if they had filled a prescription for mood stabilisers (lithium, antipsychotics, or anticonvulsants) during pregnancy, or untreated (n = 554). These groups were compared with all other women giving birth (n = 331,263).

- **Main outcome measures**: Preterm birth, mode of labour initiation, gestational diabetes, infants born small or large for gestational age, neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations.

- **Results**: Among untreated women, 30.9% (n = 171) were induced or had a planned caesarean delivery compared with 20.7% (n = 68,533) without bipolar disorder (odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.90). Corresponding values for treated women were 37.5% (n = 120) (2.12, 1.68 to 2.67). The risks of preterm birth in both treated and untreated women increased by 50%. In untreated women, 3.9% (n = 542) had a microcephalic infant compared to 2.3% (324,844) of women without bipolar disorder (1.68, 1.07 to 2.62). Corresponding values for treated women were 3.3% (n = 311) (1.26, 0.67 to 2.37). Similar trends were observed for risks of infants being small for gestational age.

### Informing patients of the teratogenic potential of mood stabilizing drugs: A case note review of the practice of psychiatrists [^111Cuvih]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate are established human teratogens. Women of childbearing potential who are prescribed these drugs should be informed of their teratogenic potential and advised of the need for adequate contraception and the protective role of folate. We reviewed the clinical records of all women of childbearing age in long-term contact with one specialist mental health Trust providing services for a total population of 750,000.

One hundred and thirty-eight (16%) of 837 women of childbearing age were prescribed one or more of these drugs. There was documented evidence that 29 (21%) of these women had been informed about teratogenicity and that 33 (24%) had been advised about contraception. Fourteen women (10%) had a confirmed pregnancy while taking lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate; eight had a complication of pregnancy.

If prescribing practice in this large mental health Trust were typical of the UK, between 7,000 and 11,000 women of childbearing potential would be prescribed lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate by psychiatrists without documented discussion of the risks.

### Prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnancy and breastfeeding: Focus on emerging mood stabilizers [^11787GEc]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorders have a high incidence during childbearing years, necessitating pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and postpartum. Recent investigations evaluated emerging mood-stabilizing agents like lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone. Studies on oxcarbazepine suggest its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. This review compares the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine with classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and postpartum.

A computerized search from 1980 to April 5, 2006, was conducted to summarize the findings.

Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety in pregnancy and lactation. Information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity. Olanzapine is associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women, while data on risperidone and quetiapine remain inconclusive. Safety information for these compounds during breastfeeding is mostly anecdotal.

Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms.

Regarding specific circumstances for schizophrenia, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications during pregnancy if possible, due to the lack of dosing flexibility.

### Management of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy [^112JWZrp]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Psychiatric conditions, including substance misuse disorders, are serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses that can be successfully treated with psychotropic drugs, even during pregnancy. Due to a lack of rigorously designed prospective studies examining the safety of these drugs during pregnancy, the prevailing clinical recommendation has been to discontinue them, particularly during the first trimester. However, over the past decade, more evidence has accumulated indicating that most psychotropic drugs are relatively safe to use during pregnancy. Not using them when indicated for serious psychiatric illnesses poses a greater risk to both the mother and child, including the risk of tragic outcomes such as suicide and infanticide.

This review presents an up-to-date and careful examination of the most rigorous scientific studies on the effects of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy. The lack of evidence in several areas means that definite conclusions cannot be made about the risks and benefits of all psychotropic drug use in pregnancy.

### Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111wWFNp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder affects 0.5% to 1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age of onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied to the treatment of peripartum women. This text summarizes knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness.

- **Method**: An expert panel reviewed articles addressing the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of using mood stabilizers during pregnancy, leading to the generation of a consensus document.

- **Results**: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, such as sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. In contrast, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past.

- **Conclusions**: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used.

### Valproate teratogenicity: A moving target [^116uDfqg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Within several years after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the late 1970s, valproate was shown to increase the risk for major congenital malformations and learning disabilities in the offspring of women who used the drug during pregnancy. Nonetheless, its use in pregnant women has persisted for more than four decades, recently resulting in numerous lawsuits and, in countries other than the United States, criminal indictments of the manufacturers of valproate.

Use of valproate in pregnancy persisted and extended beyond its original indication for the treatment of epilepsy. Several recent studies indicate that the drug is more often prescribed to treat pregnant women with bipolar depression and migraine than for seizure control. Especially concerning is the absence of valproate from the list of more than 60 drugs for which the FDA has implemented Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies to prevent or limit untoward consequences associated with specific drugs. Until this step is taken, avoidance of the teratogenic effects of valproate will rely on the vigilance of those caring for women and people with the potential to get pregnant.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during early pregnancy and congenital malformations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of more than 9 million births [^112oZPb7]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The results of this meta-analysis highlight the complexity of this topic and the need to better understand the potential effect of the underlying psychiatric diagnosis. Continued evaluation of the association between maternal use of SSRIs and congenital malformations is warranted, and there is a pressing need for new studies on the effects of individual SSRIs (and their dosage) on system-specific malformations, specifically in women with an underlying psychiatric diagnosis. The accumulated evidence suggests a generally small risk of congenital malformations and argues against a substantial teratogenic effect of SSRIs. Caution is advisable in making decisions about whether to continue or stop treatment with SSRIs during pregnancy. Stopping treatment in mothers with major depression could be more harmful for the infant than continuing use of SSRIs. This information could be helpful for pregnant women and their healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about treatment.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1143g5k5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were prespecified and selected based on potential impacts of medication exposure during pregnancy and findings from previous studies. The primary outcomes were preeclampsia (ICD-10 codes O14, O15), spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation, and birth of a small for gestational age or large for gestational age infant. Information on the onset of birth is routinely recorded in a standardized manner by the delivery ward midwife and is categorized as spontaneous, induced vaginal, or caesarean section before the onset of labor. Spontaneous onset of birth was defined as a registered spontaneous start or if a diagnosis of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (ICD code O42) was present. Small for gestational age and large for gestational age were defined as a birthweight of more than two standard deviations below or above the mean weight for gestational age according to the Swedish national reference curve.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Macrosomia (birthweight > 4000 g), hypoglycemia (ICD code P70), Apgar < 7 at 5 minutes, perinatal death, any congenital malformation, and cardiac malformations: ICD-10 code Q20 congenital malformations of cardiac chambers and connections, Q21 congenital malformations of cardiac septa, Q22 congenital malformations of pulmonary and tricuspid valves, Q23 congenital malformations of aortic and mitral valves, Q24 other congenital malformations of heart, Q25 congenital malformations of great arteries, and Q26 congenital malformations of great veins.

### Wellbutrin XL [^113kNhTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical considerations

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: A prospective, longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than those who continued antidepressants. Consider the risks to the mother of untreated depression and potential effects on the fetus when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medications during pregnancy and postpartum.

- **Data**
	- **Human data**: Data from the international bupropion Pregnancy Registry (675 first-trimester exposures) and a retrospective cohort study using the United Healthcare database (1,213 first-trimester exposures) did not show an increased risk for malformations overall. The Registry was not designed or powered to evaluate specific defects but suggested a possible increase in cardiac malformations. No increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall has been observed after bupropion exposure during the first trimester. The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.3% (9 cardiovascular malformations/675 first-trimester maternal bupropion exposures), similar to the background rate of cardiovascular malformations (approximately 1%).

### Bipolar disorder in pregnancy and postpartum: Principles of management [^113jisjp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and the postpartum period represent times of increased vulnerability for women with bipolar disorder, yet this condition remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Since 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, the risks associated with the illness and the potential risks associated with treatment should be considered when a woman of reproductive age first presents for evaluation. This article reviews the epidemiology of perinatal bipolar disorder, screening recommendations, and treatment with pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

An overview of the data in pregnancy and lactation is presented for lithium, lamotrigine, valproic acid, newer antipsychotics, and ECT. General principles of management include close monitoring during pregnancy and postpartum, careful adjustment of the treatment regimen to attenuate the risk of relapse, and avoidance of valproic acid when possible. Thoughtful consideration of these issues will minimize the risks to the mother and baby.

### Postpartum psychosis: A proposed treatment algorithm [^114AVoxx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

There is evidence for lithium as an adjunctive medication in postpartum psychosis (PPP) for both acute treatment and prophylaxis. A case report suggests it may also be effective as monotherapy in acute PPP. In a study involving 64 women with PPP, 98.4% achieved clinical remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium. In this stepwise treatment study, 6.3% achieved remission with a benzodiazepine alone, 18.8% with a combination of benzodiazepine and antipsychotic, and 73.4% with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium. The final step of the study algorithm was electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which was not used as all participants had responded to the combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and lithium. In the same cohort, 79.7% of women maintained remission at 9 months postpartum with lithium monotherapy.

Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP. However, there are concerns about declining rates of lithium prescription worldwide, with a preference for second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Similarly, in PPP, antipsychotics are routinely preferred in clinical practice for long-term relapse prevention, possibly due to clinicians' negative perception of lithium's side-effect profile and its requirement for blood monitoring. Nonetheless, given the metabolic risks of antipsychotics in women with PPP and the superiority of evidence for lithium in relapse prevention, we recommend the consideration of lithium for relapse prevention in PPP.

### Psychopharmacological drug utilization patterns in pregnant women with bipolar disorder - A nationwide register-based study [^114Ma5CU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is often associated with a lifetime indication for treatment with psychotropic drugs; thus, pregnant women face the dilemma of whether to continue treatment. This study describes the psychopharmacological drug utilization patterns among women with bipolar disorder from 12 months preconception to 12 months postpartum.

- **Methods**: We conducted a register-based cohort study among all Danish women aged 15–55 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder who gave birth to their first and singleton child between January 1997 and December 2012. Psychotropic drug use was determined by prescriptions obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry.

- **Results**: We identified 336 women. The proportion of women redeeming prescriptions for any psychotropic drug decreased during pregnancy, from 54.8% in the 3 months preconception to 36.6% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). Lithium dosing increased significantly during pregnancy. A total of 35 (41.2%) of the women on psychotropic monotherapy and 37 (50.0%) of the women on psychotropic polypharmacy used an antidepressant without concomitant use of a mood-stabilizer at some time during pregnancy.

- **Limitations**: Only the redemption of prescriptions was assessable, thus we were not able to assess compliance and discontinuation of treatment before the end of the treatment duration. There was no information on drug use during hospitalizations.

- **Conclusions**: We found a decrease in the proportion of women redeeming prescriptions during pregnancy. There was a high prevalence of antidepressant use without a mood-stabilizer.

### The effect of prenatal lithium exposure on the neuropsychological development of the child [^1138oGDw]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Lithium serum level during pregnancy did not affect neuropsychological outcomes in our study. An effect of lithium blood level on IQ was found after correction for parental IQ and maternal lifetime number of episodes, but it was not present after correction for multiple potential confounders. Importantly, lithium has a small therapeutic range that is usually closely monitored during pregnancy. As a result of this small range, a possible effect of serum level may not become apparent in our relatively small subsample. It should also be noted that serum lithium levels during pregnancy were only available in 61% of lithium‐exposed pregnancies, and that we found wide confidence intervals with our model estimates. Hence, the results of these analyses should be interpreted with caution as they were likely underpowered.

The study has several strengths and limitations. First, this is the largest prospective cohort study on this topic thus far. Another strength of this study is the use of validated tests for the assessment of IQ and neuropsychological functioning. Although we did not study every aspect of neuropsychological functioning, we provided information on IQ and six different cognitive domains. Because we recruited our participants via specialized centers for perinatal psychiatry, detailed information during pregnancy was available. This made it possible to define the exposure with large certainty and correct for the most relevant confounding factors. Additionally, by including a non-exposed control group in which the maternal psychiatric diagnosis was matched to the exposed group, the comparison was more robust.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^111i6CK8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Decision making in the treatment of bipolar disorder involves balancing risks. On the one hand, there is the increased risk of mothers relapsing with mood episodes, and on the other, there is the risk of potential congenital malformations and perinatal complications after exposure of the fetus to drugs. Our findings of increased risks for several of the investigated outcomes also in the untreated women suggest that mood stabilising treatment is probably not the sole reason for the increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes previously observed in women with bipolar disorder. The role of treatment is, however, still unclear as the overall analyses of variation in outcomes generally did not support a significant difference between treated and untreated women. The possibility of an anabolic drug effect with increased risks of gestational diabetes and reduced risks of fetal growth restriction should be noted.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^1133hFPF]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Previous studies reporting congenital malformations have been conflicting. A meta-analysis published in 2020 concluded lithium was associated with an increased likelihood of congenital malformations overall, specifically associating it with cardiac malformations. In the present study, lithium use was not associated with congenital malformations overall; however, further analysis revealed an increased risk of cardiac malformations among lithium-exposed women. It is important to note that across all studies, including ours, the absolute risk of malformation is low.

Given that large for gestational age infants are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, identifying both to be associated with lithium use strengthens the plausibility of our findings. Additionally, lithium use has been associated with altered blood glucose levels and hypoglycemia in adults, thus increasing the plausibility of this association in the neonate. Although we did not explore gestational diabetes within the present study, rates were similar in women exposed and unexposed to lithium during pregnancy. Additionally, two previous meta-analyses reported no association between maternal lithium use and gestational diabetes. Thus, the association between lithium and birth of a large for gestational age infant and neonatal hypoglycemia are unlikely to be attributed to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

### Perinatal psychiatry: Balancing maternal-fetal exposures to mental disorders and drug treatments [^111qLDyJ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). High credibility.

The potential effects of psychotropic medications during pregnancy must be balanced against those of untreated maternal mental illness, which has been under-appreciated as an exposure that impacts development. This expert, non-systematic literature review examines the effects of maternal stress and psychotropic medication on fetal development.

- **Methods**: Studies on the outcomes of pregnancy and child development following exposures to stress, mental disorders, and psychotropic medications during pregnancy are reviewed.

- **Results**: Alterations in pharmacokinetics due to the physiology of pregnancy may change the efficacy of drug treatment. The impact of stress and mental health conditions in pregnancy is challenging to separate from other exposures; however, these exposures have adverse effects on fetal and child development independent of medication treatment. A critical focus on optimal treatment to reduce psychiatric symptoms, which justifies the use of the drug, is essential. Building healthy fetal brains through adequate maternal essential nutrient intake holds promise for reducing the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Untreated maternal mental illness is an exposure that impacts outcomes, the course of comorbid medical disorders, and offspring development. The knowledge base dictates that the treatment of psychiatric disorders be prioritized in the benefit-harm decision process.

### Lithium carbonate [^115zwJ5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: See table for dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years). Obtain a serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. See the table for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose conversion.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of psychoactive drugs during pregnancy in the genomic era: Challenges and opportunities [^114Wfkg9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Various symptoms of mental illness occur commonly during pregnancy. It is estimated that serious mental disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, panic, and other anxiety disorders, occur with a frequency of 10 to 25% in community samples of US women in their childbearing years. As a result, approximately a third of all women take at least one psychoactive drug during pregnancy. Fetal drug exposure has been documented for all psychoactive drugs studied at the time of writing; however, the rate and extent of placental transfer within and between psychoactive drug classes remain ill-defined. The contribution of various genetic factors, such as the role of polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in controlling the variability of fetal drug exposure, is also unclear.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has traditionally played an important role in psychiatric pharmacotherapy during pregnancy to ensure an adequate drug dose to achieve desired benefits while avoiding excessive fetal accumulation. In the genomic era, individualized treatment with specific drugs tailored to the mother's and fetus's genotype should eventually become the standard of care. Several methodological problems need to be overcome for this prediction to become reality. One approach to this goal, taken by the Specialized Center of Research on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women's Health at the Emory University Women's Mental Health Program, is described. This research is grounded on TDM of pregnant women receiving antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anti-epileptic drugs.

### Antipsychotic drug use in pregnancy: High dimensional, propensity matched, population based cohort study [^11371WDC]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Decisions about medication use in pregnancy involve weighing the indications and potential benefits over that of potential harm to mother and child. Women requiring antipsychotic medications are at higher absolute risk for certain adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes compared with the general population. As such, it is prudent to closely monitor the medical health of these women before and during pregnancy, with particular attention to issues related to diabetes, hypertension, preterm birth, and fetal growth. However, antipsychotic medications themselves do not seem to have an extensive negative impact on important measures of maternal medical and short-term perinatal well-being. This is reassuring, at least in the short term, for a woman with serious mental illness who requires an antipsychotic medication to achieve and maintain psychiatric stability during and after pregnancy.

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: What are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach [^112jaSMU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder

Mood stabilizers are the mainstay of pharmacological management in patients with bipolar disorder. Although there is some contention about what exactly constitutes a mood stabilizer, the defining feature is that these drugs improve both manic and depressive symptoms without significantly worsening either polarity. Some drugs may benefit patients with bipolar disorder but are not classed as mood stabilizers because of their ability to precipitate mania (e.g. some antidepressants) or worsen depression (e.g. some antipsychotics).

- **Main classes of mood stabilizers**: Table 1 shows the main classes of mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate, a mood stabilizer of the anticonvulsant class, is commonly prescribed for the treatment of mania and the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. A systematic review assessing valproate efficacy in acute mania showed that it has a number needed to treat (NNT) of between 2.3 and 4.3. It may be used in patients who have either failed to respond to lithium or those who do not tolerate it. Prophylactically, the NNT to prevent manic and depressive episodes, respectively, is 21.3 and 10.5.

Valproate has a number of side effects other than risks to the mother and fetus. In any patient, these side effects must be weighed against the si.

### A case of pregnancy with severe polyhydramnios related to long-term use of lithium [^1141JpSK]. Bipolar Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Severe polyhydramnios during pregnancy may be associated with long-term lithium use and presents considerable challenges. This complication, which has been linked to induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), underscores the necessity for cautious management of pregnant women with bipolar disorder. This case report aims to elucidate the relationship between long-term lithium use, pregnancy, and the development of severe polyhydramnios, emphasizing the importance of diagnosing NDI to prevent obstetric and neonatal complications.

- **Methods**: We present the case of a 42-year-old primigravida undergoing long-term lithium treatment for bipolar disorder type I, who developed severe polyhydramnios at 34 weeks of gestation. Clinical data, including obstetric monitoring and neonatal outcomes, were analyzed.

- **Results**: This case emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with lithium treatment during pregnancy. Close monitoring and timely interventions are essential to ensure optimal outcomes for both mother and fetus.

- **Conclusions**: Our article puts forth the hypothesis that there is a link between lithium use during pregnancy and the occurrence of polyhydramnios and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which may lead to severe obstetric and neonatal complications. This case report contributes to the limited literature on the subject and provides doctors with practical advice that may assist in better risk-benefit analysis. Further research is warranted to refine risk assessment protocols and management strategies.

### Risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in women treated or not treated with mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder: Population based cohort study [^113H9nqu]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

**Strengths and limitations of the study**: The major strengths of our study were the large sample size with a population-based cohort and the inclusion of information on maternal diagnoses, drug use, and important confounders such as smoking, body mass index, and alcohol and substance misuse. The results are highly generalisable owing to the study design and minimal losses to follow-up. The bipolar diagnoses in the Swedish patient register have high validity in relation to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision. Obtaining information on drug use from the prescribed drug register ensured coverage throughout the pregnancy, except in the circumstance of admission to hospital when a drug might be administered without a prescription. However, because only four of the untreated women were admitted to a psychiatric ward during pregnancy, the lack of information on hospital drugs was of negligible importance. We did not examine other drugs or medical conditions as covariates, which, at least in theory, could have influenced our results. Treatment was measured as dispensed drugs, which does not necessarily imply the use of a drug. Regardless, fairly good agreement has been reported between the use of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics during pregnancy and dispensed drugs. Furthermore, misclassification of drug use is likely to be non-differential according to outcome status and, if anything, bias the risk estimates toward the null. The reasons for treatment, which were not known to us, might have biased the results.

### SIGN 127 management of perinatal mood disorders: A national clinical guideline [^115WmEgP]. SIGN (2012). High credibility.

In specific circumstances related to major depressive disorder, especially with regard to peripartum depression and the use of antidepressants, the SIGN 2012 guidelines recommend monitoring for alterations in fetal growth in patients taking antipsychotics during pregnancy. Additional monitoring for blood glucose abnormalities is advised when olanzapine or clozapine are used.

### Maternal lithium use and the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^111LhCx4]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Perinatal outcomes among women diagnosed with bipolar disorder, psychosis, or schizophrenia were assessed. Adjusted analyses were retrieved via inverse probability weighting. Maternal age, body mass index, smoking status, country of birth, education, parity, medical conditions, and the use of antipsychotics, neuroleptics, and lamotrigine during pregnancy were included as covariates.

### SPL drug information for lithium carbonate [^1167UoK6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lithium carbonate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor the thyroid function of the neonate and monitor neonates for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. The use of adequate methods of contraception should be encouraged. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. If used during pregnancy, serum lithium levels should be closely monitored, and prenatal diagnosis of malformations should be conducted. Use should be discontinued shortly before delivery and restarted a few days postpartum. After birth, the newborn should be monitored for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity, including thyroid function.

### Final results from 18 years of the international lamotrigine pregnancy registry [^111eEZW5]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to monitor for a signal for major teratogenicity following in utero lamotrigine exposure.

- **Methods**: Health care providers reported lamotrigine exposure during pregnancy and subsequent outcomes on a voluntary basis. Prospective reporting early in pregnancy was encouraged. Major congenital malformations (MCMs) were classified according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and were reviewed by a pediatrician on the registry's Scientific Advisory Committee. The proportion of infants with MCMs was calculated by trimester and therapy type and was descriptively compared to population-based reference estimates.

- **Results**: Over an 18-year period, 35 infants with MCMs were observed among 1,558 first-trimester monotherapy exposures: 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6%-3.1%). This was similar to estimates from general population-based cohorts. The observed proportion of infants with MCMs among 150 lamotrigine/valproate polytherapy exposures was 10.7% (95% CI 6.4%-17.0%) and was 2.8% (95% CI 1.5%-5.0%) among 430 infants exposed to lamotrigine polytherapy without valproate. No consistent pattern of malformation type or malformation frequency by dose was observed.

- **Discussion**: The registry did not detect an appreciable increase in MCM frequency following first-trimester lamotrigine monotherapy exposure. With over 1,500 first-trimester monotherapy exposures, the registry was powered to detect major teratogenicity. The proportion of infants with MCMs following lamotrigine/valproate polytherapy exposure was high but similar to that previously reported.

### Lithium exposure during pregnancy increases fetal growth [^114mXtU2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Thanks to a collaboration between Erasmus University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, we were able to include a large number of women with bipolar disorder who used lithium during pregnancy. Additionally, through a collaboration with the Generation R study, we compared this group with a representative sample of the general population, which increased the power of this study.

The results of this study need to be interpreted with a few limitations in mind. As in any observational study, we cannot rule out residual confounding, namely, unmeasured factors associated with both lithium and fetal growth. For example, we did not have detailed information on education and socioeconomic status in the lithium group and were therefore not able to adjust for these possible confounders. However, it is unlikely that our results are driven by a confounding effect of socioeconomic status. Bipolar disorder is associated with lower socioeconomic status, and low socioeconomic status has been associated with lower birth weight. On the contrary, we find fetal growth to be increased in the lithium group.

Other possible confounding factors of importance might be related to the severity of the psychiatric disease, as well as dosing regimens and serum levels of lithium, glucose metabolism, and nutrition. Also, our study was not designed to study trimester-specific effects since we assessed fetal growth at one time point during pregnancy. We did have birth weight data, enabling us to conclude that the effect we found at around 20 weeks of gestation was still present at birth.

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: An observational study [^116uqB3i]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Lithium blood level changes following delivery (Aim 1)**:
	- We identified 78 women with a total of 100 pregnancies who were referred to the specialized outpatient university clinics of Rotterdam (n = 57) and Leiden (n = 21). The most common psychiatric diagnosis was bipolar spectrum disorder (n = 68, 87.2%), while the remaining women (n = 10, 12.8%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, depressive disorder, or borderline personality traits. The median parity of all pregnancies was 1 (range 0–6) and the mean age at delivery was 34.6 years (SD 4.3). There were a total of 233 lithium blood level measurements: 55 (23.6%) in the week before delivery and 178 (76.4%) in the week after. The mean lithium dosage was 1071 mg (SD 368) in the week before delivery and 1016 mg (SD 284) in the week after delivery. The mean lithium blood level was 0.73 mmol/L in the week before delivery and 0.70 mmol/L in the week after delivery. The course of the lithium blood level/dose ratio before and after delivery can be seen in Figure 1. There was no association between time and ratio (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.03, P = 0.63). Lithium blood levels not normalized to dose can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.

- **Lithium blood levels and neonatal complications (Aim 2)**:
	- We included a total of 29 neonates for which a lithium measurement was performed within 24 hours postpartum (20 umbilical cord, 9 neonatal vein puncture). Cohort characteristics are represented in Table 1. While approximately half of the neonates had a complication.

### Lithium placental passage and obstetrical outcome: Implications for clinical management during late pregnancy [^113PG81R]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Lithium has been used during pregnancy for more than four decades, but the quantification of fetal lithium exposure and clinical correlations of such exposure are limited. The study objectives were to:

- **Quantify the rate of lithium placental passage**:
	- Assess the rate at which lithium crosses the placenta.

- **Assess any association between plasma concentration of lithium at delivery and adverse perinatal events**:
	- Determine if there's a correlation between lithium levels at delivery and negative outcomes for the newborn.

- **Determine whether lithium concentrations can be reduced by briefly suspending therapy proximate to delivery**:
	- Investigate if pausing lithium treatment shortly before delivery lowers its concentration.

- **Method**: Maternal blood and umbilical cord blood were obtained at delivery for assay of lithium concentrations, and obstetrical outcome data were collected prospectively for 10 participants. These data were combined with results from MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches that identified 32 cases in which maternal lithium was administered throughout delivery. Statistical analysis of the pooled data was conducted.

- **Results**: The ratio of lithium concentrations in umbilical cord blood to maternal blood (mean = 1.05, SD = 0.13) was uniform across a wide range of maternal concentrations (0.2–2.6 meq/liter). Significantly lower Apgar scores, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of CNS and neuromuscular complications were observed in infants with higher lithium concentrations (> 0.64 meq/liter) at delivery. Withholding lithium therapy for 24–48 hours before delivery resulted in a 0.28 meq/liter reduction in maternal lithium concentration.

- **Conclusions**: Lithium completely equilibrates across the placenta. Higher lithium concentrations at delivery are associated with more perinatal complications.
