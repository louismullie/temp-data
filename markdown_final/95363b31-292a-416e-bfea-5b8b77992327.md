## Question

What is rhonchi in the lungs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what rhonchi are in the lungs, how they differ from related sounds, what they mean pathophysiologically, how reliable clinicians are at identifying them, and how to interpret and act on them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative definitions and where rhonchi fit within standardized lung sound terminology. Then, I should verify the acoustic and temporal characteristics that distinguish rhonchi from wheezes and crackles. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and typical clinical contexts in which rhonchi occur. After that, I need to check the reliability and interobserver variability data for rhonchi identification. Finally, I will integrate practical clinical implications, documentation standards, and when to escalate to imaging or airway clearance strategies, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on a vague descriptor. Rhonchi are abnormal, low-pitched, snoring-like breath sounds typically generated by airflow through partially obstructed larger airways, often with secretions, and they are categorized as adventitious, continuous, low-pitched sounds distinct from high-pitched wheezes and discontinuous crackles, which aligns with contemporary data standards and respiratory literature [^112U3xTN] [^112QVbEc] [^112fn5Ax].

> Wait, let me verify the acoustic features and timing because misclassification is common. Rhonchi are continuous, low-pitched, and often change or transiently disappear with coughing due to movement of secretions, whereas wheezes are continuous but higher pitched and more musical, and crackles are brief, discontinuous, popping sounds; this distinction is repeatedly emphasized in interobserver studies and mechanistic reviews, and it helps explain why rhonchi may fluctuate with cough or position [^112fn5Ax] [^112fn5Ax].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Rhonchi arise when turbulent airflow interacts with secretions and airway wall instability in larger bronchi, creating low-frequency oscillations; they are commonly associated with conditions characterized by mucus hypersecretion and impaired clearance such as acute bronchitis, COPD exacerbations, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia, and they can also accompany aspiration syndromes where diffuse secretions provoke widespread low-pitched sounds, which fits with their clinical distribution and behavior [^112fn5Ax] [^111RmxLK] [^115cvBbB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic specificity. I should confirm how reliable clinicians are at identifying rhonchi. Multiple interobserver studies show poor to fair agreement for rhonchi, with κ values often below 0.3, and even experienced clinicians frequently conflate rhonchi with low-pitched wheezes or other sounds; this variability is worse in pediatrics and in noisy environments, and it persists across languages and training backgrounds, underscoring the need for cautious interpretation and, when possible, standardized descriptors or combined categories [^112fn5Ax] [^111fmuMk] [^112hmwBP] [^1144WtHb].

> Let me consider the clinical implications pragmatically. Rhonchi suggest secretions in larger airways and should prompt assessment for infection, COPD, bronchiectasis, or aspiration; their tendency to change with cough supports a secretory source, and their presence can guide decisions about airway clearance, bronchodilators, and imaging if the course is atypical or severe; in acute settings, rhonchi may coexist with other abnormal sounds, and their distribution can hint at focal consolidation or diffuse airflow limitation, but I should double-check that I'm not overinterpreting a single auscultatory finding without correlating with symptoms, spirometry, or imaging when indicated [^112fn5Ax] [^113ePoKJ] [^117HpQn5].

> I should confirm documentation standards so communication is clear. High-credibility data standards list rhonchi as a permissible lung exam finding alongside rales, wheezing, and crepitations, and they define rhonchi as abnormal snoring-like breath sounds suggesting partial obstruction; using these standardized terms improves comparability across clinicians and settings, and when interobserver variability is a concern, documenting broader categories such as "wheezes/rhonchi" or "crackles" can improve reliability while preserving clinically useful detail [^112U3xTN] [^112QVbEc] [^111fmuMk].

> But wait, what if rhonchi are actually low-pitched wheezes in disguise. The literature acknowledges that rhonchi and low-pitched wheezes are often used interchangeably, which contributes to poor agreement; when terms are lumped, interobserver reliability improves, so if my diagnostic reasoning hinges on whether a sound is "rhonchi" versus "low-pitched wheeze", I should verify with repeat auscultation after cough, consider the clinical context, and avoid overcommitting to a label that won't change management [^112fn5Ax] [^111fmuMk].

> Next, I should review when to escalate beyond the stethoscope. If rhonchi persist without expected improvement, if there are focal findings with systemic signs, or if there is concern for central airway obstruction or empyema, point-of-care lung ultrasound or chest imaging can refine the diagnosis; case-based evidence shows rhonchi accompanying pneumonia with empyema and critical central airway obstruction, and large ICU data demonstrate poor agreement between auscultation and lung ultrasound for pulmonary edema, reinforcing the value of adjunct imaging when the stakes are high [^111X7dKP] [^114d9avR] [^1134x1fN].

> I will now examine therapeutic implications briefly. When rhonchi reflect secretion retention, directed cough and other airway clearance techniques can be helpful, though routine chest physiotherapy components beyond cough add limited benefit; computerized lung sound analysis suggests rhonchi can decrease after airway clearance, but high-quality evidence is limited, so I should tailor interventions to symptom burden, sputum production, and patient preference while monitoring for clinical response rather than relying solely on the disappearance of rhonchi [^113ePoKJ].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. Rhonchi are low-pitched, continuous, snoring-like sounds generated by turbulent airflow through partially obstructed, secretion-laden larger airways; they are nonspecific but commonly accompany secretory airway diseases and aspiration; clinicians show poor agreement in identifying them, so I should document using standard terms, correlate with the whole clinical picture, and deploy imaging or objective measures when findings drive high-consequence decisions or when the course is atypical [^112U3xTN] [^112QVbEc] [^111Tme2j].

Rhonchi are **low-pitched, snoring-like breath sounds** caused by airflow through partially obstructed larger airways, typically from secretions or airway wall instability [^112fn5Ax]. They are continuous, often heard during both inspiration and expiration, and may **change or disappear with coughing** [^111Tme2j]. Rhonchi are common in COPD, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia, and indicate mucus or airway narrowing; they are distinct from wheezes (higher-pitched) and crackles (discontinuous) [^112fn5Ax]. Management targets airway clearance, bronchodilation, and treating the underlying cause [^113ePoKJ].

---

## Acoustic characteristics

- **Pitch and frequency**: Low-pitched, typically below 200 Hz [^111Tme2j].
- **Duration**: Continuous, often spanning inspiration and expiration [^notfound].
- **Quality**: Snoring or gurgling, sometimes described as sonorous [^112QVbEc].
- **Variability**: May change or disappear with coughing due to mucus movement [^112fn5Ax].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Rhonchi arise from **airflow through partially obstructed larger airways**, with key mechanisms including:

- **Mucus accumulation**: Secretions in bronchi/bronchioles cause turbulence and vibration [^112fn5Ax].
- **Airway wall instability**: Collapse or narrowing from inflammation or structural disease [^112QVbEc].
- **Bronchospasm**: Transient narrowing from smooth muscle constriction [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and associated conditions

Rhonchi indicate **partial airway obstruction** from secretions or narrowing and are associated with:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| COPD | Chronic airflow limitation with mucus hypersecretion [^117CqtNQ] |
| Bronchitis | Inflammation and mucus in bronchi [^111RmxLK] |
| Bronchiectasis | Chronic airway dilation with secretions [^117YL4cT] |
| Pneumonia | Infection with mucus and inflammation [^notfound] |
| Aspiration | Foreign material causing obstruction [^notfound] |

---

## Differentiation from other lung sounds

Rhonchi are **distinct from other adventitious sounds**:

| **Attribute** | **Rhonchi** | **Wheezes** | **Crackles** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pitch | Low | High | Variable |
| Duration | Continuous | Continuous | Discontinuous |
| Quality | Snoring/gurgling | Musical | Popping/crackling |
| Timing | Inspiration/expiration | Expiration > inspiration | Late inspiration [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Rhonchi guide therapy toward **airway clearance and bronchodilation**:

- **Airway clearance**: Directed cough, postural drainage, or mechanical devices [^113ePoKJ].
- **Bronchodilators**: Beta-agonists or anticholinergics for bronchospasm [^notfound].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Antibiotics for infection, smoking cessation, or disease-specific therapy [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and variability in clinical assessment

Rhonchi identification has **substantial interobserver variability**, especially in children and across languages, reducing diagnostic reliability [^112hmwBP] [^1144WtHb]. Digital auscultation and AI may improve objectivity and consistency [^116VCqG8].

---

Rhonchi are **low-pitched, continuous sounds** from airflow through partially obstructed larger airways, often due to mucus or airway instability [^111Tme2j]. They are common in COPD, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia, and management focuses on airway clearance, bronchodilation, and treating the cause [^113ePoKJ].

### Acoustic monitoring – super sonics? [^116NgBcU]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Vesicular breath sounds, wheezes, rhonchi, and crackles possess acoustic 'signatures' amenable to detection, quantification, and moment-by-moment visual display. Despite technical hurdles, new methods for sonic evaluation, once perfected, should offer innovative diagnostic and monitoring tools that add clinical value. These emerging options complement current 'static/global' monitoring of mechanics and gas exchange with dynamic regional information long missing from the optimal care of the ventilated patient with critical illness.

Conclusion

We found only slight to fair agreement for detailed descriptions of crackles and wheezes. Broader terms were more reliably shared between the observers.

In many previous studies, detailed descriptions of the sounds have been based on computerised analysis. Fine and coarse crackles have been identified by the duration of each crackle as shown on a phonogram. It is more difficult to differentiate the types of crackles by listening. It is, for instance, possible that the amplitude of crackles plays a role in how the sound is perceived. Loud crackles may be perceived to be coarser than faint crackles of the same duration.

It can also be difficult to differentiate between low-pitched and high-pitched wheezes by listening. Separation based on a 200 Hz cut-off has been recommended. Few observers can perfectly determine the pitch, and observer disagreement on this subclassification is therefore not surprising. Agreement on the presence of rhonchi was particularly poor in our study. This is in accordance with previous studies, where the agreement on rhonchi was much weaker than the agreement on crackles and wheezes. Since the terms 'rhonchi' and 'low-pitched wheezes' are used interchangeably, low agreement could be expected. The task force decided anyway to include 'rhonchi' as a separate category, thinking the term could be preferred for low-pitched wheezes that do not sound musical but more like snoring, With our results, it seems difficult to agree on this division of low-pitched continuous sounds.

Other characteristics of crackles and wheezes may be more important and also easier to identify than those applied in our classification. The number of crackles may be of importance and also the timing during inspiration. In terms of wheezes, both sound intensity and the duration of the wheezes in each respiratory phase are of importance. Shim and Williamsfound that the three characteristics high pitch, intensity and spanning the entire phase were linked to decreased peak expiratory flow rate in patients with asthma.

The 20 cases were from real patients with various lung diseases, both children and adults, and in eight cases more than one category of adventitious sound was presented. Six of the eight complex cases were recordings from children, and these might have been more difficult to classify than the recordings with only one kind of adventitious sound. This may have led to poorer agreement in the paediatric cases than in the adult cases.

Key messages

How can we improve the agreement on lung sound descriptions?
Although auscultation of the lungs is important in medical diagnosis and decision-making, disagreement on the use of terms describing the sounds weakens the diagnostic value of the adventitious lung sounds for chest diseases.
Poor agreement was found when 12 observers classified lung sounds from video recordings of 20 patients with lung diseases into detailed categories, whereas acceptable agreement was obtained when the terms were combined into broader categories.

The stethoscope is the quintessential iconic symbol of the medical profession. However, the reputation of this 200-year-old instrument as a useful diagnostic tool in lung disease has been declining since chest radiography became available. Reports on the limited diagnostic value of chest auscultation in conditions like pneumoniaand heart failurehave contributed to the low standing of chest auscultation among medical experts today. Guidelines from the Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) give little credit to lung sounds, and auscultation findings are not even listed among clues to early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, however, wheezing is mentioned to be a main symptom of asthma.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^116EtxaZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

To avoid misunderstanding on chest findings by auscultation, the use of combined terms of crackles and wheezes, or similar categories in other languages, should be encouraged when health workers communicate with each other. This does not mean that more precise terms should be discarded. Distinguishing between fine and coarse crackles and high-pitched wheezes and low-pitched wheezes/rhonchi may be important for some diagnoses, for example, during early stages of interstitial lung fibrosis when fine inspiratory crackles are heard. This may also be relevant in various obstructive airway diseases of young children where 'wheeze' is too broad a term to adequately characterise their lung sounds. However, large studies with relevant outcomes that take other easily available information into account need to be carried out to prove the clinical usefulness of such differentiation.

Strengths and limitations

The video cases were selected from a larger group of files to ensure only high-quality recordings with few artefacts. Although artefacts are also common in real life, we expect that agreement on all recordings without the application of quality criteria would have been poorer than the results presented here.

The mixture of observers increased the probability of transferable results. The task force members had some clinical information on the cases they had contributed to, but although this could have had some influence on their rating of these cases, this knowledge could not have had any significant effects on the agreements.

The statistical strength of the differences in κ values between detailed and lumped categories of sounds may be questioned. The CI of the κ for inspiratory crackles (figure 3) did not include the κ values for fine or coarse inspiratory crackles (figure 2), and that of expiratory crackles did not include the κ of fine expiratory crackles. Likewise, the CIs for inspiratory and expiratory wheezes did not include the respective κ values for rhonchi and low-pitched wheezes (figures 2 and 3). This indicates that improved agreements after lumping were statistically significant.

An initial reference collection of 20 audiovisual recordings has recently been made available online as part of the ERS site Learning resources. We wanted to determine the interobserver variation in the classification of these sounds, with particular attention to more or less detailed descriptions of adventitious sounds. We also wanted to assess a potential influence of the professional background, that is, paediatrician versus family physician or adult medical specialist, on the classification of recordings from children and adults.

Clinical studies have shown that lung auscultation is far from useless. Crackles predict radiographically confirmed pneumonia more strongly than any single respiratory symptom, and wheezes are heard more frequently with increasing severity of bronchial airflow limitation. However, the results of such studies may be challenged when one takes into consideration the interobserver variation in the description of lung sounds between clinicians. Efforts to standardise the terminology led to a statement from the International Lung Sound Association (ILSA) in 1987. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) established a Task Force on Lung sounds in 1999, and a report aiming at the standardisation of computerised analysis of lung sounds, including a chapter on terminology, was published in 2000. An overview of our present knowledge on lung sounds and recommended terminology has recently been published.

In a review on interobserver agreement on chest findings and their diagnostic value published in 2010, the authors found great variation between the published studies in terms of lung sounds, with mostly fair to moderate agreement in the use of terminology. In a study from primary care in 12 European countries in 2007, great variation between the countries was found in the use of lung sound terms in patients with acute cough. It seems, therefore, that earlier attempts to standardise lung sounds terminology have failed to improve agreement between physicians on how to describe the lung sounds they hear during chest auscultation. This is important because lung auscultation is still commonly used in clinical practice, and the findings have an impact on the treatment of patients. Hearing crackles, for instance, strongly predicts antibiotic prescribing. The current nomenclature system with its distinction between coarse and fine crackles and between rhonchi and wheezesmay make it more difficult to reach agreement on the use of terms. The differences in terminology between different languages hampers meaningful exchange of chest auscultation findings between clinicians and researchers from different countries. These considerations prompted the institution of another ERS Task Force in 2012 to further standardise the use of lung sound terminology between clinicians and researchers from countries with different languages, based on a repository of audiovisual recordings of lung auscultation.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^116TinHd]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Agreement among the majority of observers (seven or more) on each of the 10 terms in each of the 20 cases was identified. To further evaluate this interobserver agreement, Fleiss' multirater kappa (κ) with 95% CIs was calculated. The κ values were interpreted as follows: 0–0.20 slight, 0.21–0.40 fair, 0.41–0.60 moderate, 0.61–0.80 substantial, and 0.80–1.0 almost perfect agreement. After calculating agreement on the 10 predefined categories, multirater κ was calculated after combining fine and coarse crackles in a common category, rhonchi with high-pitched and low-pitched wheezes, and finally the respective inspiratory and expiratory sounds into simply crackles and wheezes. Agreement in reporting other sounds than the 10 fixed options were elevated for sounds reported by seven or more observers to be present in the same case. We also calculated Fleiss' κ among the paediatricians and the observers familiar with examining adults in subsamples of children and adult patients. SPSS V.22 and R statistical package were used in the analyses.

Impact of age of cases and kind of physician

The agreement tended to be stronger on the adult cases than on the child cases. The paediatricians did not reach better agreement on the child cases than the doctors familiar with examining adults (figure 4).

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — current symptoms and signs: physical examination — define data elements and permissible values for documentation. Body mass index has permissible values of Numeric, kg/m² or Unknown. Third heart sound (S3) is recorded as presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound, and fourth heart sound (S4) as presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound, with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. Heart murmur status is captured as presence of heart murmur(s), and heart murmur timing is documented as Systolic, Diastolic, Continuous, or Other. Lung (pulmonary) examination findings specify findings on auscultation of the lungs with permissible values including Clear or normal, Rales, Decreased breath sounds or dullness, Rhonchi, Wheezing, Crepitations, Pleural friction rub, Absent breath sounds, and Other findings, with example permissible value definitions such as Lungs are normal on auscultation and Abnormal breath sounds (crackles) heard on auscultation indicating inflammation, fluid, or infection of the lung.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^113LpMFb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Respiratory Society (ERS) lung sounds repository contains 20 audiovisual recordings of children and adults. The present study aimed at determining the interobserver variation in the classification of sounds into detailed and broader categories of crackles and wheezes.

Methods

Recordings from 10 children and 10 adults were classified into 10 predefined sounds by 12 observers, 6 paediatricians and 6 doctors for adult patients. Multirater kappa (Fleiss' κ) was calculated for each of the 10 adventitious sounds and for combined categories of sounds.

Results

The majority of observers agreed on the presence of at least one adventitious sound in 17 cases. Poor to fair agreement (κ < 0.40) was usually found for the detailed descriptions of the adventitious sounds, whereas moderate to good agreement was reached for the combined categories of crackles (κ = 0.62) and wheezes (κ = 0.59). The paediatricians did not reach better agreement on the child cases than the family physicians and specialists in adult medicine.

Conclusions

Descriptions of auscultation findings in broader terms were more reliably shared between observers compared to more detailed descriptions.

Results

Frequencies of agreement

High-pitched expiratory wheeze was the predefined sound category most frequently reported by the observers, and in 5 of the 20 cases the majority (seven or more) of the observers reported this sound. The majority of observers never reached this level of agreement on the terms expiratory fine crackles, inspiratory or expiratory rhonchi, and inspiratory low-pitched wheezes. The term low-pitched wheezes was more frequently used than rhonchi and when these interchangeable terms were combined, better agreement was reached (figure 1), and it was even better when combined with high-pitched wheezes. Likewise, when fine and coarse crackles were combined into one category, agreement among the majority of the task force members occurred more frequently (figure 1). Such agreement on the presence of one or more of the four sound categories (inspiratory and expiratory crackles and wheezes) was reached in 16 of the 20 cases. The majority agreed on more than one of the four categories in 8 of the 20 cases, in 2 adult cases and 6 child cases. In one case, the majority of observers reported pleural rub (table 1).

Multirater κ agreements

Slight multirater kappa agreement was found for 5 of the 10 basic descriptions of lung sounds (κ ≤ 0.20), fair agreement for four of the categories (κ 0.21–0.40) and moderate agreement for one category only, high-pitched inspiratory wheezes with κ = 0.43 (figure 2). After combining fine and coarse crackles and high-pitched and low-pitched wheezes together with rhonchi, moderate agreement was reached for three of the four categories (figure 3). An even better agreement was reached after further lumping inspiratory and expiratory sounds, with kappas for crackles and wheezes of 0.62 and 0.59, respectively (figure 3). The agreement on pleural rub reached a κ of 0.52.

### Point of care ultrasound diagnosis of empyema [^111X7dKP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency ultrasonography is an efficient and cost effective tool for patients who are in respiratory distress. Chest radiographs can yield limited information for these patients. Computed tomography scans have long been the criterion standard for advanced imaging in patients with respiratory complaints, but point of care ultrasound (POCUS) can be performed at bedside, does not expose the patient to radiation, and at times may provide more information than a computed tomography scan.

Case Report

A 60-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension presented to the emergency department complaining of a productive cough associated with fever, weakness, and progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion over the previous 1 to 2 weeks. The physical examination was remarkable for rhonchi in the right upper lobe and diminished breath sounds throughout the right lung. POCUS was performed, and the results revealed severe atelectasis and hepatization of the right lung parenchyma with visualized air bronchograms. Complex hypoechoic material with a posterior spine sign was noted, which increased concern for complex consolidation and effusion. The diagnosis of pneumonia with empyema was made. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? POCUS has become a much more commonly used imaging modality within many emergency departments. Ultrasound is more sensitive than chest radiographs for identifying pathologies such as pneumothorax and simple effusions. This case shows how well POCUS can diagnose empyema even in the setting of diagnostic uncertainty of computed tomographic imaging.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^116NDuAp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

This is a study of interobserver variation between medical doctors in classifying lung sounds from video recordings performed at respiratory units in Spain, Greece, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada during 2013. The recording equipment was standardised, using video cameras with external microphone input (Canon Legria HF series, Panasonic HC-X900) and quality electret microphones which were placed in the tubes of standard stethoscopes. More details have already been published. Each centre obtained ethics approval at their institution and prepared consent forms in their required formats.

The quality of 80 video recordings were rated by five of the six task force members, leaving out the member who had done the actual recordings, and they recommended whether or not to include the recording on the repository. Twenty recordings, 10 of children and 10 of adults, were judged to be of sufficient quality. The recordings, each of approximately 15 s duration, were classified independently by the six task force members on an online questionnaire (FluidSurveys.com, Ottawa, Canada). Five of the task force members were paediatricians and one a general practitioner (GP). Their age ranged from 52 to 64 years. Subsequently, the 20 recordings were classified by a convenient sample of six additional physicians who used the same online questionnaire. Three were internationally recognised lung sound researchers aged 59–71 years, among whom one was a paediatrician, and three Norwegian GPs aged 38–49 years. The latter had postgraduate clinical experience of 6 years or more, but no exposure to lung sound research. The observers downloaded the video files to their computers and were asked to classify the recordings according to recommended English language nomenclature (fine and coarse crackles, high-pitched and low-pitched wheezes). We also included the category of rhonchi, although it is used interchangeably with low-pitched wheezes. Identification by respiratory phase thus offered 10 non-exclusive choices. The questionnaire also offered free-text options to describe adventitious sounds by other terms.

All observers reported normal hearing capacity, except for one 71-year-old expert who reported some trouble with speech perception at higher frequencies, but not with lung sounds that were typically below 1000 Hz. No instructions were given regarding the volume setting for audio playback.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^1134x1fN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, auscultation might be challenging as dorsal lung fields are difficult to reach in supine-positioned patients, and the environment is often noisy. In recent years, clinicians have started to consider lung ultrasound as a useful diagnostic tool for a variety of pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary edema. The aim of this study was to compare lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation for detecting pulmonary edema in critically ill patients.

Methods

This study was a planned sub-study of the Simple Intensive Care Studies-I, a single-center, prospective observational study. All acutely admitted patients who were 18years and older with an expected ICU stay of at least 24h were eligible for inclusion. All patients underwent clinical examination combined with lung ultrasound, conducted by researchers not involved in patient care. Clinical examination included auscultation of the bilateral regions for crepitations and rhonchi. Lung ultrasound was conducted according to the Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency protocol. Pulmonary edema was defined as three or more B lines in at least two (bilateral) scan sites. An agreement was described by using the Cohen κ coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy. Subgroup analysis were performed in patients who were not mechanically ventilated.

Results

The Simple Intensive Care Studies-I cohort included 1075 patients, of whom 926 (86%) were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Three hundred seven of the 926 patients (33%) fulfilled the criteria for pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound. In 156 (51%) of these patients, auscultation was normal. A total of 302 patients (32%) had audible crepitations or rhonchi upon auscultation. From 130 patients with crepitations, 86 patients (66%) had pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound, and from 209 patients with rhonchi, 96 patients (46%) had pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound. The agreement between auscultation findings and lung ultrasound diagnosis was poor (κ statistic 0.25). Subgroup analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of auscultation was better in non-ventilated than in ventilated patients.

Conclusion

The agreement between lung ultrasound and auscultation is poor.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^114uZtSu]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Only slight to fair agreement was found for detailed descriptions of the adventitious sounds. In contrast, moderate to substantial agreement was reached for the combined categories of crackles and wheezes. For the wheezes, there was also moderate to substantial agreement when differentiating between inspiratory and expiratory sounds. The paediatricians did not agree better than the other doctors on the lung sounds from children. Overall, agreement on paediatric lung sounds was poorer than that on lung sounds from adults.

Similar or somewhat stronger agreements on the presence of crackles and wheezes were found in this study compared to most previous studies. In most previous studies, the observers listened to real patients and registered crackles and wheezes without specifying the respiratory phase. Moderate agreement with κ values between 0.41 and 0.60 have usually been found, also in a study where a teaching stethoscope was used, allowing four observers to listen simultaneously. In a few studies, the observers have listened to audiotapes and reached similar or somewhat better agreements. No previous interobserver study of auscultation findings has been based on high-quality audiovisual recordings with a microphone inserted into the tubing of a regular stethoscope. The most comparable previous study had observers watching video recordings and registering wheezing heard without a stethoscope. In that study, the multirater kappa agreement was 0.36. The moderate to substantial agreement found in this and previous interobserver studies on lung sounds is not inferior to agreement reached in other examinations frequently used in pulmonary medicine, like consolidation on chest radiography (κ 0.4–0.6)and the CT patterns of bronchiectasis, emphysema and honeycombing (κ 0.42–0.59).

### International perception of lung sounds: a comparison of classification across some European borders [^1144WtHb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

It was a strength of our study that we included a group of experienced lung sound researchers. They represent recommended use of terminology, and comparison with their classifications may be enlightening, although they were not used as a reference standard.

A strength of our study was also the heterogeneity of the observers in terms of clinical background, experience and country of residency. We believe this gives us a better external validity than if we had included a homogenous sample. However, this factor also presented some challenges concerning language and terminology, which was a weakness of the study.

Different use of lung sound terminology may influence the interobserver agreement. The group of Russian GPs had a lower intragroup and intergroup agreement. We think this situation might be partly explained by confusion around the terminology. Anecdotally, we note that the Russian GPs were familiar with a terminology for lung sounds similar to the classic terminology of Laennec, which offers more options than the simple distinction between wheezes and crackles. A higher agreement within the group and with the experts would probably be found if the study had been based on their own terminology. A similar problem was present in the Dutch sample, where the observers found it difficult to classify what they call 'rhonchi' as wheezes or crackles and used the variable 'other abnormal sounds' more frequently than the other groups. In contrast, a terminology restricted to wheezes and crackles is used in UK and Norway, and this has probably made it easier to obtain higher agreements in these countries.

We did not present audiological definitions of crackles and wheezes. As indicated by the Russian and Dutch classifications, the example sounds and the translations to own language did not quite remove the terminology problems. However, clinicians are not familiar with audiological definitions, and we do not think such definitions would have been helpful.

Implications for research

For future research, it is important to be aware that it might be difficult to reach high kappa values when the prevalence of the trait of study is very low or very high, even though absolute agreement may be high. This has probably had little impact on the kappa coefficients we observed, since the prevalence of crackles and wheezes was 21% and 7.9%, respectively. However, much lower prevalence of adventitious lung sounds could be found in real epidemiological data. Accordingly, specific measures should be implemented when using this method in epidemiological studies in order to improve its reliability such as training of raters, consensus agreement, multiple independent observations and standardisation of the terminology.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111PVWwK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory — Airway Management assessment directs clinicians to implement emergent interventions and monitoring and specifies key history and physical examination elements. History should assess time of onset of symptoms; associated symptoms and triggers for dyspnea (e.g., exertion, exercise, lying flat); history of asthma or other breathing disorders; choking or other evidence of upper airway obstruction; history of trauma; prior similar episodes and what has helped in the past, including home interventions; and severity of shortness of breath or sensation of dyspnea. Physical examination should assess for abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort; use of accessory muscles; ability to speak words or sentences; quality of air exchange including depth of respiration and equality of breath sounds; and abnormal breath sounds such as wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor.

### DeepBreath-automated detection of respiratory pathology from lung auscultation in 572 pediatric outpatients across 5 countries [^116VCqG8]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory diseases are a diverse range of pathologies affecting the upper and lower airways (pharynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles), lung parenchyma (alveoli) and its covering (pleura). The restriction of air flow in the variously sized passageways creates distinct patterns of sound that are detectable with stethoscopes as abnormal, "adventitious" sounds such as wheezing, rhonchi and crackles that indicate airflow resistance or the audible movement of pathological secretions. While there are some etiological associations with these sounds, the causal nuances are difficult to interpret by humans, due to the diversity of differential diagnoses and the non-specific, unstandardized nomenclature used to describe auscultation.

Indeed, despite two centuries of experience with conventional stethoscopes, during which time it has inarguably become one of the most ubiquitously used clinical tools, several studies have shown that the clinical interpretation of lung sounds is highly subjective and varies widely depending on the level of experience and specialty of the caregiver. Deep learning has the potential to discriminate audio patterns more objectively, and recent advances in audio signal processing have shown its potential to out-perform human perception. Many of these new advances were ported from the field of computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adapted for audio signals have achieved state-of-the-art performance in speech recognition, sound event detection, and audio classification. Audio is often transformed into a 2D image format during standard processing. The most common choice being a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the audio frequency over time.

### Chest physical therapy for children hospitalised with acute pneumonia: a randomised controlled trial [^114jnZPL]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The indication for chest physical therapy as an adjunct to the treatment of children hospitalised with acute pneumonia remains controversial and there is a lack of robust scientific evidence for the effectiveness of this modality in these patients.

Methods

A randomised controlled trial was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in southern Brazil. Children aged 29 days to 12 years hospitalised with pneumonia between February and October 2006 were recruited; 51 were randomly allocated to the intervention group (chest physical therapy plus standard treatment for pneumonia) and 47 to the control group (standard treatment for pneumonia alone). The primary outcome was time to clinical resolution. The secondary outcomes were length of stay in hospital and duration of respiratory symptoms and signs.

Results

There were no significant differences in terms of median time to clinical resolution (4.0 vs 4.0 days, p = 0.84) and median length of hospital stay (6.0 vs 6.0 days, p = 0.76) between the intervention and control groups. The intervention group had a longer median duration of coughing (5.0 vs 4.0 days, p = 0.04) and of rhonchi on lung auscultation (2.0 vs 0.5 days, p = 0.03) than the control group.

Conclusions

Chest physical therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment does not hasten clinical resolution of children hospitalised with acute pneumonia and may prolong duration of coughing and rhonchi.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^112fn5Ax]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will check the limitations of the existing auscultation method by checking the types of abnormal breathing sounds and the accuracy of analysis through the existing stethoscope. Next, we will introduce the new auscultation methods developed so far (AI-assisted analysis and wireless or attached stethoscopes) and the current status of breath sound analysis using them. Furthermore, we will suggest further research directions in the future.

Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds

Respiratory sounds are produced by the airflow in the respiratory tract and are divided into two categories: Normal or abnormal sound. Normal respiratory sound is made when there is no pulmonary disorder and consist of tracheal, bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular sounds. Abnormal respiratory sounds are caused by diseases at the lung or bronchus. They can be described by the mechanism of production, location they are detected in, characteristics (such as continuity, range of pitch, timing mostly heard), and acoustic features (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of abnormal lung sounds and related diseases

Crackles are short, discontinuous, explosive sounds heard during inspiration and sometimes on expiration. Fine crackles are generated by inspiratory opening of small airways and associated with interstitial pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Coarse crackles are produced by gas passing through intermittent airway opening and are related to secretory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Wheezes are generated in the narrowed or obstructed airway. They have high frequency (> 100–5000 Hz) and sinusoidal oscillation in sound analysis. They usually occur in obstructive airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhonchi are induced by the narrowing of airways, caused by the production of secretions, so rhonchi can disappear after coughing (Table 1).

Stridor is a high-pitched, continuous sound produced by turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway of upper respiratory tract. It is usually a sign of airway obstruction that requires prompt intervention. In patients with pleural inflammation such as pleurisy or pleural tumor, a visceral pleura becomes rough, and its friction with the parietal pleura generates crackling sounds, a friction rub (Table 1).

Although respiratory sounds are not difficult for a trained clinician to discern in usual cases, some sounds are ambiguous even for an expert to distinguish accurately. In addition, there are some cases where a mixture of several abnormal breathing sounds can be heard. Novel AI-assisted stethoscope can be useful for these challenging situations.

### Noninvasive ventilation as a temporizing measure in critical fixed central airway obstruction: a case report [^114d9avR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Critical central airway obstruction (CAO) requires emergent airway intervention, but current guidelines lack specific recommendations for airway management in the emergency department (ED) while awaiting rigid bronchoscopy. There are few reports of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in tracheomalacia, but its use as a temporizing treatment option in fixed, malignant CAO has not, to the best of our knowledge, been reported.

Case Report

An 84-year-old woman presented to the ED in respiratory distress, too breathless to speak and using her accessory muscles of respiration, with bilateral rhonchi throughout the lung fields. Point-of-care arterial blood gas revealed severe hypercapnia, and NIV was initiated to treat a presumed bronchitis with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Chest radiography revealed a paratracheal mass with tracheal deviation and compression. A diagnosis of critical CAO was made. While arranging for rigid bronchoscopic stenting, the patient was kept on NIV to good effect. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Recommendations for emergent treatment of life-threatening, critical CAO before bronchoscopic intervention are not well established. Furthermore, reports of NIV use in CAO are rare. We suggest that emergency physicians consider NIV as a temporizing measure for critical CAO while awaiting availability of bronchoscopy.

### Deep learning diagnostic and risk-stratification pattern detection for COVID-19 in digital lung auscultations: clinical protocol for a case-control and prospective cohort study [^111iZRkv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The development of DeepBreath

DeepBreath is a deep learning algorithm to diagnose and stratify risk of COVID-19 from lung sounds. In preparation for these analyses, digital auscultations are cleaned to crop non-biological frequencies and amplitudes generated by ambient noise. The frequency range of normal lung sounds extends from below 100 Hz to 1000 Hz, with a sharp drop at approximately 100 to 200 Hz, whereas tracheal sound extends between 100 and 5000 Hz. In the lower band range (under 100 Hz), heart and thoracic muscle sounds overlap. Abnormal lung sounds (wheezing, rhonchi etc.) have characteristic frequencies and duration, differentiating them from each other. In this study, all signals will be sampled at 16 kHz with a resolution of 8-bit, and the built-in filter will range from 20 to 2000 Hz. Heart and thoracic muscle sounds, as well as other background low-frequency noises will be filtered out through a high-pass filter (cut-off frequency 150 Hz).

The sounds will then be divided into overlapping time windows of between 1 and 10 s and transformed to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Several data augmentation techniques will be explored, such as amplitude scaling, pitch shift, and random time shift. The effect of each pre-processing method will be tested and the best performing approach according to sensitivity and specificity will be reported. This dataset will then be fed into a convolutional neural network with max pooling and dropout before binary classification by a support vector machine (SVM) into positive vs negative COVID-19 test results (diagnostic model) or hospitalisation/death vs outpatient/self-resolving (risk stratification model). Longitudinal auscultations on individual patients who were hospitalised will also be used to assess the severity and progression of the disease, normalized at the time of symptom onset.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^112i7rXg]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Variables

All included patients underwent clinical examination followed by CCUS within the first 24 h of their ICU admission. The researchers were senior medical students and junior residents trained by cardiologist-intensivists for both clinical examination and CCUS before contributing to the study. Training included self-study of theory on how to perform auscultation and lung ultrasound, at least 2 h hands-on training from cardiologists-intensivists, practice on healthy individuals during practical sessions, and supervised clinical examination and CCUS in the first 20 patients.

Data from the clinical examination was prospectively collected based on definitions in the protocol, including the presence of crepitations and rhonchi. Abnormal auscultation was defined as the presence of crepitations and/or rhonchi at any of the sites. Pulmonary edema was defined as the presence of three or more B lines; diffuse pulmonary edema was defined as edema in two or more scan sites of LUS bilaterally.

Auscultation was performed of the anterior and axillary lung fields in each hemithorax with the patient in a supine position. Subsequently, CCUS was performed following a predefined protocol using a phased array probe (M3S or M4S) set at a frequency of 3.6 MHz, a depth of 15 cm, and maximal image width (Vivid-S6, GE Healthcare, London, UK). LUS was performed using the Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency (BLUE) protocol, assessing six scan sites per patient (superior, inferior, and lateral, bilateral) (Fig. 1). In each scan site, the numbers of B lines (0–5) were recorded. Measurements were subsequently conducted by researchers, who were not involved in patient care. Researchers were instructed not to share their findings with the attending physicians, so that these were used for research purposes only.

### Conventional chest physical therapy for obstructive lung disease [^113ePoKJ]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Chest physical therapy (CPT) is a widely used intervention for patients with airway diseases. The main goal is to facilitate secretion transport and thereby decrease secretion retention in the airways. Historically, conventional CPT has consisted of a combination of forced expirations (directed cough or huff), postural drainage, percussion, and/or shaking. CPT improves mucus transport, but it is not entirely clear which groups of patients benefit from which CPT modalities. In general, the patients who benefit most from CPT are those with airways disease and objective signs of secretion retention (eg, persistent rhonchi or decreased breath sounds) or subjective signs of difficulty expectorating sputum, and with progression of disease that might be due to secretion retention (eg, recurrent exacerbations, infections, or a fast decline in pulmonary function). The most effective and important part of conventional CPT is directed cough. The other components of conventional CPT add little if any benefit and should not be used routinely. Alternative airway clearance modalities (eg, high-frequency chest wall compression, vibratory positive expiratory pressure, and exercise) are not proven to be more effective than conventional CPT and usually add little benefit to conventional CPT. Only if cough and huff are insufficiently effective should other CPT modalities be considered. The choice between the CPT alternatives mainly depends on patient preference and the individual patient's response to treatment.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^113tN6tT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Description of SARS

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4–6 days; most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure. Some evidence suggests that the incubation period may be as long as 14 days in some persons.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (,–). In some patients, headache, myalgia, and malaise precede the onset of fever by up to 1 day, and fever may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms appear. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2–7 days after illness onset, although they are among the initial symptoms in up to 30% of patients (,–). The most common respiratory complaints are lower respiratory tract symptoms, including nonproductive cough and dyspnea; productive cough is reported in up to 25% of patients (,–). In some series, < 10% of patients reported upper respiratory complaints, but in others the reported prevalence of rhinorrhea or sore throat is as high as 25% among patients with SARS. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms has varied by report, but nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of these symptoms has been reported in up to 25% of patients with SARS at the time of initial evaluation. In one series, diarrhea developed in 73% of patients at some point in the course of illness. Fever and diarrhea have been the dominant initial symptoms in some patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon.

Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure may not have typical symptoms of SARS. For patients in this group who have strong epidemiologic risk factors for SARS, the diagnosis should be considered in almost any change in health status, even if the patients do not exhibit typical clinical features.

Physical Findings

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia have been reported in 40% to 75% of patients upon admission to the hospital (,–) but may be less common in patients who are evaluated earlier in the course of illness as outpatients. Upon auscultation of the lungs, rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series, and less commonly in others. Some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. As many as 15%–44% of patients may have a normal measured body temperature when first evaluated.

### Outcome measures for airway clearance techniques in children with chronic obstructive lung diseases: a systematic review [^112QotWK]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Airway pathogens, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are known to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CF. It is, however, unclear whether adequate mobilization of secretions influences the bacterial load. Only McIlwaine et al. obtained sputum samples every three months for bacteriologic culture. No significant changes were found over one year in either the PEP group or the OPEP group. A pilot study by Dingemans et al. studied the influence of shear stress induced by IPV on the bacterial load and gene expression of P. aeruginosa in adults with CF. They concluded that IPV at high frequency could potentially alter the behavior of P. aeruginosa, but this should be verified in a larger group of patients.

Apart from a study published in 1962 by Denton et al. no studies were found performing lung auscultation to evaluate ACTs in children with chronic obstructive lung diseases. Denton et al. reported that normal breathing sounds improved and the presence of rhonchi decreased in the majority of patients after one session of conventional CPT. However, no statistical analysis was performed to endorse these results. Computer Aided Lung Sound Analysis (CALSA) has earlier been proposed to be a convenient outcome measure for respiratory physiotherapy. Since previous studies including adult patients indicated that CALSA shows potential to be a sensitive measure for the detection of local changes in the airways after airway clearance. Future research is required to assess the abilities of CALSA to quantify treatment effects of ACTs in the pediatric population.

### Influence of observer preferences and auscultatory skill on the choice of terms to describe lung sounds: a survey of staff physicians, residents and medical students [^113dgbcG]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Use of incorrect terms by the three groups was consistent with data from the literature. In an earlier study, Wilkins and colleaguesfound that only 32% of pulmonary physicians (n = 233) and 11% of physicians with other specialties (n = 54) were able to identify the pleural friction rub of their sound sample #6. That study also found that 20% of the physicians surveyed failed to identify the normal breath sound of sample sound #7. However, the authors gave no information about the incorrect terms used. Most recently, Hafke-Dys and colleaguesasked 185 observers, including physicians and medical students, to listen to audio recordings of 24 respiratory sounds and match their assessment with descriptions provided by a team of specialists. Consistent with our findings, they found that the percentage of correct rating was low, the best results being noticed for wheezes (40%) and the stridor (30%). Interestingly, their observers used practically the whole list of proposed terms to describe the sound samples. As a result, on many occasions, the sound recordings were matched with incorrect terms. To quote but a few examples, sound samples #3 and #6 — labelled by the experts as 'normal breath sound' — were matched by many observers with terms like 'wheeze', 'rhonchi' or 'coarse crackles'; similarly, samples #2 and #17 — labelled as 'inspiratory wheezes' — were matched with several terms, including 'normal breath sound', 'prolonged expiration' and 'crackles'.

### Prevalence and clinical associations of wheezes and crackles in the general population: the troms ø study [^116f5W1Y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Wheezes and crackles were common findings. Any of these sounds were found in almost one third of our sample. Wheezes and crackles were associated with increasing age. The sounds were not always related to clinically diagnosed disease, but their prevalence increased in the presence of decreased lung function or chronic shortness of breath.

We are not aware of any comparable study carried out in a general population. An investigation with 700 participants conducted by Murphy et al. found wheezes and rhonchi in 4 and 4%, respectively, in a subgroup of 334 apparently healthy adults. Wheezes were heard in 59% of patients with asthma. For crackles, the prevalence was 21% in the apparently healthy group and 71% in patients with COPD. These prevalences were higher than what we observed, except for wheezes in the apparently healthy group. In their study, the age of the participants was not taken into account. They included more recording sites than in ours and used a computerized classification of the sounds. Different sensitivities of the classification methods may partly explain the discordance in prevalence. Crackles detected by a computer algorithm may be inaudible with a stethoscope since crackles may be masked by normal sounds.

In most participants with ALS in our study, these were heard at only one of the six recording sites. The number of sites with positive findings had an impact on the associations. The model with inspiratory crackles at two or more locations as outcome performed better than the model predicting any crackles, reaching an AUC of 0.79. No similar effect of increasing number of sites was found regarding wheezes.

The importance of age was described by Kataoka et al. who observed a rising prevalence of crackles from 11% in cardiovascular asymptomatic adults 40–65 years to 70% in participants 80–95 years old. Murphy et al. found an association with age among asbestos exposed workers. Age relates to a reduction of supporting tissue around the airways causing a premature closure of the airways. The influence of lung and heart disease associated with ageing might have contributed to the strong association between crackles and age in our study, an influence beyond what indicated by self-reported diseases, spirometry and pulse oximetry.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^1138UG9e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill children are vulnerable to fluid overload due to complex fluid management. Early positive fluid balance may lead to systemic venous and pulmonary congestion, which can be challenging to detect clinically. Venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) and lung ultrasound (LUS) are emerging point-of-care tools to assess these complications. In adults, VExUS is classified into five grades (A–E) based on Doppler flow patterns. However, evidence on the use of VExUS, particularly in combination with LUS, in critically ill children with fluid overload is scarce, and their clinical utility in this setting is yet to be established.

Objectives

To evaluate the correlation between positive fluid balance and VExUS and LUS scores in critically ill children.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, from November to December 2024. The study included critically ill children aged 1 month to 18 years with a positive fluid balance within the first 24 h of admission. Correlations between VExUS and LUS scores, fluid balance, and clinical signs were analyzed.

Results

In 40 critically ill children, there was no correlation between VExUS or LUS scores with positive fluid balance > 5%. Additional results revealed a correlation between VExUS A and rhonchi (r = 0.367, p = 0.020), VExUS B and rhonchi (r = 0.367, p = 0.020), and VExUS D and edema (r = 0.328, p = 0.039).

Conclusion

VExUS and LUS scores were not significantly correlated with positive fluid balance. VExUS A, B, and D correlated with rhonchi and edema in critically ill children with fluid overload.

### Influence of observer preferences and auscultatory skill on the choice of terms to describe lung sounds: a survey of staff physicians, residents and medical students [^116Ydp1p]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Sound sample # 4 (Stridor): Of 132 observers describing this sound sample, 112 (84.8%) — including 26 staff physicians, 55 residents and 31 medical students — correctly identified the stridor it contained. Of these, 110 (98.2%) used the term stridor, while 1 resident and 1 medical student used the term 'croup'. The 20 observers (15.2%) who failed the identification used 7 terms: wheeze, cat meow, hoarseness, whistling, speech, bronchospasm and musical.

Sound sample #5 (Pleural friction rub): Of 108 observers participating, 14 (13%) — including 10 physicians, 3 residents and 1 medical student — correctly identified the pleural friction rub of the sample. They used the term friction rub on six occasions, pleural rub on five, pleural friction rub on two and pleural crackle on one. The 94 subjects (87%) who failed the sound identification used 11 terms as follows: crackle, crepitation, rale, rhonchi, wheeze, bronchial breathing, pericardial friction, consolidation, bronchial, pericardial rub and pulmonary 'longesk'.

Three-group agreement on correct and incorrect terms

Table 1 shows that, on 107 of 140 possible occasions (76.4%) — corresponding to the total number of responses provided by the smallest group, that is, staff physicians — the three groups used identical terms to describe the sound samples. However, further analysis showed that on 70 such occasions (65.4%), the agreement concerned correct terms, while on 37 (34.6%), it involved incorrect terms. Among correct terms, the most used were stridor (on 26 occasions) and wheeze (on 24 occasions). Among incorrect terms, the most used were crepitation (on nine occasions), crackles (on six occasions) and rhonchi (on six occasions).

Correct and incorrect terms by group

Sample sound #1 (Normal breath sound): Of 129 participants describing this sound sample, 20 (15.5%) correctly classified it as 'normal breath sound'. They used the term 'normal sound' on 11 occasions (SP = 3; R = 4; MS = 4) and 'vesicular sound' on 7 occasions (SP = 3; R = 2 and MS = 2). Two, non-conventional terms, namely 'good air entry' and 'alveolar sound' were considered as conveying the idea of normalcy; they were used by one resident and one medical student, respectively. The 109 observers (84.5%) who failed to identify the sound used 10 terms as follows: crepitation, crackles, bronchial breathing, friction, rhonchi, rubbing, wheeze, rale, gurgling and pleural effusion.

Sound sample #2 (Wheezes): Of 134 participants, 114 (85.1%) correctly identified the wheezes of this sound sample; all — including 24 staff physicians, 52 residents and 38 medical students — used the term wheeze. The 20 observers (14.9%) who failed the identification used 10 terms, namely: stridor, rhonchi, crepitation, bronchial breathing, pleural friction rub, prolonged expiration, sighing, murmur, systolic murmur and the initials LLL.

Sound sample #3 (Fine crackles): Of 122 participants describing this sound sample, 82 (67.2%) — including 16 staff physicians, 37 residents and 28 medical students — correctly detected the crackles it contained; however, none qualified them as 'fine' or specified their location in the respiratory cycle. Correct raters used the term crepitation on 39 occasions, crackles and rales on 18 occasions each and crepitus on 4. Additionally, three participants used the qualifying term Velcro, while one used the term alveoli. The 40 raters (32.8%) who failed to identify the sound used 11 terms, as follows: bronchial breathing, normal sound, snoring, wheeze, rhonchi, bronchial breathing, friction rub, coarse, harsh, air entry and decreased air entry.

### Automated lung sound analysis in patients with pneumonia [^111iY5t1]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether objectively detected lung sounds were significantly different in patients with pneumonia than those in asymptomatic subjects, and to quantify the pneumonia findings for teaching purposes.

Methods

At a community teaching hospital we used a multi-channel lung sound analyzer to examine a learning sample of 50 patients diagnosed with pneumonia and 50 control subjects. Automated quantification and characterization of the lung sounds commonly recognized to be associated with pneumonia were used to generate an "acoustic pneumonia score". These were examined in the learning sample and then prospectively tested in 50 patients and 50 controls.

Results

The acoustic pneumonia score averaged 13 in the learning sample and 11 in the test sample of pneumonia patients. The scores were 2 and 3 in the controls. The positive predictive value of a score higher than 6 was 0.94 in the learning sample and 0.87 in the test sample. The sensitivities in the 2 groups were 0.90 and 0.78, and the specificities were 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. Adventitious sounds were more common in pneumonia patients (inspiratory crackles 81% vs 28%, expiratory crackles 65% vs 9%, rhonchi 19% vs 0%).

Conclusion

Our lung sound analyzer found significant differences between lung sounds in patients with pneumonia and in asymptomatic controls. Computerized lung sound analysis can provide objective evidence supporting the diagnosis of pneumonia. We believe that the lung-sound data produced by our device will help to teach physical diagnosis.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^112NQi2b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lung sound recording

The frequency range of normal lung sounds extends from below 100 Hz to 1000 Hz, with a sharp drop at approximately 100 to 200 Hz, whereas tracheal sound extends between 100 to 5000 Hz. In the lower band range (under 100 Hz), heart and thoracic muscle sounds overlap. Abnormal lung sounds (wheezing, rhonchi etc.) have characteristic frequencies and duration, differentiating them from each other. In particular, fine velcro-like crackles are caused by explosive openings of the small airways, have a distinguishable high-pitched frequency of about 650 Hz, and a typical short duration of about 5 ms.

In this study, the lung sounds will be gathered digitally in all subjects with the same Eko CORE digital stethoscope (Eko Devices, Inc. CA, USA). Four anterior thoracic sites (superior and inferior bilaterally), 4 posterior sites (superior and inferior bilaterally),) and 2 lateral sites (right, left) will be auscultated per patient using the stethoscope. For each auscultation site, a 30-s digital recording will be acquired. Patients will be informed of the necessity to breathe deeply. All signals will be saved as 16-bit resolution, 4 kHZ-sampled WAV files. The built-in filter will range from 20 to 2000 Hz. Heart and thoracic muscle sounds, as well as other background low-frequency noises, will be filtered out through EKO software's high-pass filters. Coded recorded sounds will be synced in real-time to a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-compliant secured cloud-storage location. Random auscultatory recordings will be reviewed by the study investigators for quality control.

### Excessive longitudinal FEV1 decline and risks to future health: a case-control study [^1174Xu9Z]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) in an individual is considered an indicator of developing lung disease.

Methods

We investigated longitudinal FEV₁ slopes, calculated by simple linear regression, and adverse health outcomes after 10–30 years, among 1,428 chemical plant workers. Cases were defined by FEV(1) slopes below 5th percentile values for the cohort. Cases were matched with controls (107 pairs) for race, gender, smoking status, year of birth, age, height, and calendar year at first test. Matched pair statistics were used for comparisons.

Results

Cases had a higher proportion, compared to controls, of diagnosis of COPD or emphysema (17.8% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.0002), medication use for respiratory diseases (24.3% vs. 4.7%, P < 0.0001), dyspnea (15% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.0042), and wheezing or rhonchi on examination (10.3% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.0225).

Conclusions

Chemical plant workers who experienced accelerated FEV₁ declines experienced four to nine times as many adverse health conditions over 10–30 years.

### A 5-year-old boy with miliary and osteoarticular tuberculosis [^1124vVq2]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular involvement is one manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). We present a 5-year-old Burmese boy with 10 months of right hip pain and decreased range of motion. The patient also had low-grade fever, cough and decreased appetite. The patient was undocumented and had recently moved from Myanmar. He was thin, in moderate distress with bilateral lung rhonchi, mild subcostal retractions, low back pain, right hip tenderness and painful and limited right range of motion. The patient's chest and pelvis radiographs showed a miliary pattern and right acetabulum osteolytic lesions, respectively. He was started on anti-TB medication and cefotaxime. Ofloxacin was added because of the concern of drug-resistant TB. The patient underwent a right hip debridement. His symptoms improved markedly, with improved mobility. TB is a challenging infection to diagnose, which can cause significant delays in management.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^113uwdG7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Clinical signs observed at 24 h-time point. The bar height represents the value of fluid balance. No subjects with rhonchi and hepatomegaly

The VExUS component includes an assessment of the IVC diameter and hepatic, portal and intrarenal venous Doppler. At 24 h of observation, most of the IVC was not distended (82.5%), and 85% of the hepatic Doppler waves and 60% of the portal Doppler waves were normal. All intrarenal vein Doppler waves were normal. The same pattern was observed at 48 h. The VExUS score was then interpreted as a grading of congestion, according to the VExUS classifications of A, B, C, D and E. A comparison of the VExUS scores between each VExUS grade at 24 and 48 h of monitoring is shown in Fig. 3. The current study utilised POCUS LUS to assess B-lines, consolidations, and pleural effusions, translating these findings into a semi-quantitative LUS score (Table 4).

Fig. 3
Distribution of VExUS scores grouped by classes A to E. The scores among classes within 24-hour (A) and 48-hour (B) observations were different. Post hoc analysis revealed differences among the groups as well

The results of the correlation analysis of VExUS scores by class with clinical parameters such as fluid balance are presented in Table 5. The results of the correlation analysis of the VExUS score with several clinical parameters by class are presented in Table 6. The results revealed a correlation between the clinical signs of Rhonchi syndrome and VExUS A (r = 0.367; p = 0.020) and VExUS B (r = 0.367; p = 0.020), as well as between the clinical signs of edema and VExUS D (r = 0.326; p = 0.039). The direction and strength of the correlation between VExUS A and B to Rhonchi and VExUS D to edema were weakly positive.

### Primary lung adenocarcinoma mimicking recurrent pneumonia in a young adult [^112cQDZZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 20s with a history of tobacco use presented with recurrent shortness of breath. He was hospitalised three times within the past 4 months for similar symptoms despite completing several courses of antibiotic therapy. In this presentation, he was afebrile with rhonchi and decreased breath sounds over the right lung. Chest CT demonstrated large consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes, worsened compared with 4 months prior. Infectious workup including bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage did not identify a causative organism. Testing for immune disease was negative. Transbronchial biopsy ultimately identified well-differentiated stage 3b lung adenocarcinoma with a KRAS G12C mutation. The patient was referred to oncology for outpatient follow-up and has since initiated chemotherapy. This case highlights diagnostic biases encountered in young patients and the utility of bronchoscopic biopsy for definitive diagnosis in presumed community-acquired pneumonia when the clinical outcome is not improving as expected.

### Singing for lung health-a systematic review of the literature and consensus statement [^111a3iBE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

By what mechanisms can SLH be beneficial?

The benefits of singing can be considered in three broad categories — physical, psychological and social — though these necessarily overlap and interact. Although breathing patterns are to an extent determined, or at least limited, by pathophysiological processes such as airflow obstruction and abnormal lung compliance, breathing pattern can be modified by conscious attention or training to influence use of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. For example, skills acquired during singing may help to avoid the rapid 'breath-stacking' pattern of breathing in COPD, where dynamic hyperinflation reduces inspiratory reserve volume and worsens breathlessness. Inspiratory capacity manoeuvresand chest wall kinematics confirm that singing lowers end-expiratory lung volumes in COPD.

There is an established repertoire of physiotherapy techniques for helping to manage breathlessness in patients with COPD, including postural modification, breathing control, pursed lips breathing and 'blow as you go'. These improve respiratory muscle and/or lung and airway mechanics, prolonging expiratory time, allowing a reduction in operating lung volumes. Controlling expiration through singing techniques may have analogous effects, being useful when managing and recovering from episodes of extreme breathlessness. Singing may also enhance sputum clearance as both dynamic lung volume and airflow are increased, features present in conventional physiotherapy techniques.

### Incidence and impact of swimming-induced pulmonary edema on navy SEAL candidates [^117UKjPo]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory complications such as swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) are a common feature of United States Navy Special Warfare (NSW) training.

Research Question

This study was designed to evaluate the incidence and clinical features of SIPE seen in this population.

Study Design and Methods

A prospective, observational review of all NSW candidates over a 15-month period was designed. Baseline height, weight, and ECG data were obtained. Candidates with respiratory issues were evaluated with a two-view chest radiograph and ECG while symptomatic and were closely followed up. The chest radiograph and clinical data were then independently reviewed.

Results

A total of 2,117 NSW candidates participated in training during the study period, with 106 cases of SIPE identified (5.0%). Ten additional cases of SIPE were repeat episodes in candidates already diagnosed. Forty-four cases of pneumonia were identified (no repeat cases). The majority had cough (90.4%), frothy-pink sputum (35.6%), and hemoptysis (23.7%). Overall, 80.1% of candidates had an oxygen saturation ≥ 90%. Physical examination findings were variable: crackles (50%), wheezing (36%), and rhonchi (19%). Several had more than one feature; 23% presented with a normal examination. Radiologic findings in patients with SIPE most commonly revealed an interstitial pattern with perifissural thickening, larger average azygos vein diameter, larger average heart size, and normal lung height. ECG findings were not significantly different from baseline. Height and weight were not significantly different between the groups. Lower water temperatures were suggestive of increased SIPE incidence, but this was not a statistically significant trend.

Interpretation

The burden of SIPE in NSW training was greater than anticipated. Clinical symptoms and physical examination assisted by imaging were able to differentiate SIPE from pneumonia. ECG was not a useful diagnostic or screening tool, and height and weight did not affect risk of SIPE.

### Interrater reliability of pediatric respiratory auscultation findings [^112hmwBP]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the interrater reliability of pediatric auscultatory findings as assessed by pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter survey of physicians in 6 academic PEM divisions in the United States. Respondents listened to 15 audio clips of pediatric auscultatory sounds and classified them as normal or as having 1 or more adventitious sounds. We calculated Fleiss' κ to evaluate interrater reliability of auscultatory findings among respondents. We stratified results based on study site and years of experience.

Results

Surveys were distributed to 128 physicians, with responses from 106 (83% response rate). Only the identification of normal breath sounds (κ = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.45–0.47) met threshold criteria for reliability. Other findings did not reach this threshold, including stridor (κ = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.31–0.33), wheeze (κ = 0.25, 95% CI, 0.24–0.25), crackles (κ = 0.15, 95% CI, 0.15–0.16), and rhonchi (κ = 0.15, 95% CI, 0.14–0.15). Some sites demonstrated greater intrarater reliability compared with others. Stratified by years of experience, only interpretation of normal breath sounds and stridor among physicians with 0 to 4 years of experience and the interpretation of normal breath sounds among physicians with 15 or more years of experience reached acceptable reliability. Compared with a reference standard, highest accuracy was noted in the interpretation of normal breath sounds (Accuracy = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.83–0.87).

Conclusion

We found poor interrater reliability in the interpretation of most pediatric breath sounds, except in the identification of normal breath sounds. These findings support a need for more robust approaches toward the accurate identification of respiratory pathology in children.

### Physiological basis of respiratory signs and symptoms [^115wjVbK]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

An understanding of the physiological processes underlying respiratory function in the healthy individual is essential in recognising and understanding disease processes. Departure from the normal pattern of tidal breathing is an early and reliable sign of respiratory disease. Understanding the normal distributions of pressures within the thoracic cage, airways and lungs allows one to predict the site of airway obstruction. Respiratory signs and symptoms are based on alterations of normal physiology by the disease process. Unfortunately, these basic principals are rarely emphasised in current teaching programs.

### Sex and the lung: observations, hypotheses, and future directions [^115kzRJ1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Sex-related differences in a variety of lung diseases in infants and young children are reviewed, including respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic lung disease of prematurity, lower respiratory tract illnesses and wheezing, asthma, diffuse, and interstitial lung diseases, and cystic fibrosis. Differences in anatomy and physiology, such as airway size, airway muscle bulk, airway reactivity, airway tone, and cough reflexes may explain much of these sex differences. Better understanding of sex-related lung differences could help personalize respiratory treatment.

### Cough. 6: which investigations are most useful in the diagnosis of chronic cough? [^116w9UxL]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

There is no consensus as to the best diagnostic strategy for chronic cough. Many protocols combine empirical trials of treatment with laboratory investigations. More precise diagnostic tools and improved therapeutic options are required. Until then, the management of chronic cough will remain a clinical challenge.

### Lung function trajectories in health and disease [^113wWTj8]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The normal lung function trajectory from birth to death has three phases: a growth phase (from birth to early adulthood), a plateau phase (that lasts for a few years), and a decline phase resulting from physiological lung ageing. Numerous genetic and environmental factors can alter one or more of these phases. Evidence shows that several lung function trajectories exist throughout the life course and, importantly, that some of them are associated with substantial implications for health and disease. Here, we review the evidence, formulate a series of questions, and identify various challenges that need to be addressed to identify potential opportunities to promote respiratory health.

### Pediatric pulmonology 2024 year in review: rare and diffuse lung disease [^115Xd6L2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

NEHI is a form of chILD, characterized by tachypnea, hypoxemia, crackles, and failure to thrive. Distinct chest CT findings associated with NEHI include air trapping and ground glass opacities (GGOs), predominantly in the right middle lobe, lingula, and/or perihilar regions. Miraftabi et al. provided a critical examination of the histopathologic characteristics of NEHI, noting that the original histopathologic criteria may not apply uniformly to all patients with this condition. This study detailed the GGO ratios in children with NEHI, consisting of 11 patients with biopsy‐confirmed NEHI and another 11 with a clinical history suggestive of NEHI but with biopsy results inconsistent with the diagnosis. Interestingly, the maximum GGO ratio calculated in this cohort did not correlate with the percentage of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) observed in the biopsies, despite being from anatomically similar regions. This finding is consistent with prior studies that areas of GGO do not necessarily correspond with increased PNECs. Furthermore, one patient presented with clinical characteristics typical of NEHI, alongside consistent biopsy findings, yet lacked imaging results indicative of the condition. This raised concerns about the possibility of an alternative disease process involving increased PNECs rather than NEHI. It is worth considering that the identified areas of GGOs may represent normal lung tissue on expiratory scans, while the areas exhibiting air trapping may be the true pathological findings, and therefore biopsies of the GGOs would not be expected to have increased PNECs. This manuscript underscores the significant gaps in our understanding of NEHI in children. In a separate commentary, Griese et al. reviewed the developmental conditions manifesting in infancy, which encompass persistent tachypnea of infancy (PTI), pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), and NEHI. The authors emphasized the importance of recognizing the developmental nature of these disorders and argue for the use of PTI as the preferred label over NEHI, citing the rarity of lung biopsies and the lack of a definitive causal relationship between PNECs and PTI. The commentary encouraged pediatricians to avoid superficial diagnoses and instead to search for associated and underlying conditions with the help of clinical expertize and genetic testing. To expand upon our current diagnostic capabilities, Marczak et al. investigated the utility of various serum biomarkers in diagnosing NEHI in children compared with healthy controls. They observed that children with NEHI had elevated serum levels of KL‐6 compared to healthy controls, although these levels were relatively low. Elevated levels of KL‐6 have been associated with various forms of chILD. While biomarkers like KL‐6 hold diagnostic potential, their precision remains uncertain.

### Nirsevimab (Beyfortus) [^111JqVov]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of MA RSV LRTI caused by RT-PCR-confirmed RSV, characterized predominantly as bronchiolitis or pneumonia through 150 days after dosing. Medically Attended (MA) includes all healthcare provider visits such as physician office, urgent care, emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Signs of LRTI involvement included rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheezing; and at least one sign of worsening clinical severity including at least one of the following: increased respiratory rate, hypoxemia, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, nasal flaring, retractions, grunting, or dehydration due to respiratory distress. Incidence of RSV LRTI with hospitalization was a prespecified secondary endpoint. RSV hospitalization was defined as hospitalization for LRTI with a positive RSV test.

Table 5 displays the primary efficacy result for Trial 03.

In Trial 03, the efficacy of BEYFORTUS against MA RSV LRTI with hospitalization in infants born at GA greater than or equal to 29 weeks and less than 35 weeks, who received a single dose of 50 mg BEYFORTUS, based on the relative risk reduction was 78.4% (95% CI 51.9, 90.3; p = 0.0002), through 150 days post dose.

### Baby's first cries and establishment of gas exchange in the lung [^114FjKPA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
(A) During the fetal period, lung liquid fills the alveoli to FRC with slight positive pressure maintained by elevated upper airway resistance. Pulmonary blood flow is low, partly because of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. (B) The first few cries lead to asymmetric ventilation of right nondependent areas of the lung. Increased alveolar pressure plays a role in lung liquid clearance. Expiratory "braking" during crying and "pendelluft" flow leads to redistribution of ventilation to dependent regions of the lung. (C) Improved aeration of the dependent regions and pulmonary vasodilation associated with tidal respirations improves oxygenation. Qp = pulmonary blood flow. Illustration by Satyan Lakshminrusimha.

The new information provided by Tingay and colleagues using breath-by-breath electrical impedance tomography shows that as the infants are transitioning to air-breathing, they have two distinct breathing patterns: crying and tidal breathing. Crying is the primary breathing that recruits FRC, which is achieved within 43 breaths. The initial gas flow goes primarily into the right lung to nondependent sections and is nonuniform (Figure 1B). Crying is associated with the expiratory braking of flow, which redistributes gas in the lung by pendelluft flow to preserve FRC (Figure 1C). These are unique patterns of breathing and gas flow that probably occur only during the neonatal transition to air-breathing. Inflation of the lungs also contributes to lung liquid clearance.

### The highs and lows of wheezing: a review of the most popular adventitious lung sound [^113YQjtr]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

Wheezing is the most widely reported adventitious lung sound in the English language. It is recognized by health professionals as well as by lay people, although often with a different meaning. Wheezing is an indicator of airway obstruction and therefore of interest particularly for the assessment of young children and in other situations where objective documentation of lung function is not generally available. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms producing wheeze, its subjective perception and description, its objective measurement, and visualization, and its relevance in clinical practice.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112srRRm]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective — clinical cough is a reflex event beginning with activation of vagal afferent sensory nerves located in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites that project the signal centrally, where it undergoes modulation, resulting in the generation of the appropriate efferent motor response. This concept of distinct afferent sites has provided the rationale for use of the anatomic diagnostic protocol to evaluate and manage patients with cough, and this approach has become embedded in clinical practice, leading to a broad recognition that asthma, GERD, and upper airways disease are, at least in adult patients, the most common causes of chronic cough; adequate treatment of one or more of these causes is effective in the majority, although a significant minority remains troubled with unexplained, refractory chronic cough despite extensive investigation and trials of therapy. The most sensitive regions of the airways for mechanically eliciting cough are the larynx and the tracheal and bronchial bifurcations.

### Singing for lung health: a qualitative assessment of a British lung foundation programme for group leaders [^115nU3FE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Singing leaders have also reported many health improvements in participants who have sung in their groups.

The nurse had… put it down to the singing that was something that was improving their lung function. — Colin

It's that kind of mental well-being aspect and then actually from singing you get that great rush of endorphins and it makes you more alert. — Toni

SLH is complicated

Singing leaders provided great detail about the complicated nature of SLH. There is a skill to adapting repertoire for degrees of breathlessness, and the session should be performed with musicality and rhythm throughout.

Them thinking they won't be able to get to that third phrase, whereas one phrased of the same length they are doing (it)… so just kind of playing about with the repertoire a bit. — Eileen

It's actually encouraging people to use their bodies and their breath in a way that's helpful for them, without them paying too much attention to that as the outcome. — Carly

Providing a ' safety net ' of a simple repertoire where the group do not feel too challenged initially allows individuals to flourish within a group. The skilled leader can then develop this repertoire by adding rounds or harmonies for example.

No one should ever fail. — Janice

Songs sung with simple repertoire, in a call and response format, were often seen as effective. If singers use handouts for complicated lyrics, attention should be directed towards any changes in posture as a result and advice to correct poor posture is advised:

African songs, they are very accessible… People haven't generally done them before and um they are usually very rhythmic, so very diatonic so they are using very very simple tune, almost like nursery rhymes you know, they are very primary harmony easy to do, really easy to pick up and very rhythmic usually… they do often incorporate movement as well… — Rachael

My experience is you do all of this movement and getting people moving and breathing and you give people a song sheet and they hold onto it and they are looking down at it and they have closed their windpipe and they're not singing very well. — Julie

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^1147h6Tf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation tests to detect underlying AHR.

### Wandering coronary stenoses: adrenaline-induced coronary artery spasm in a patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest [^115kt5Rm]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old ex-smoker man with history of allergy, presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea one hour following self-medication with aspirin for troublesome headache. Examination revealed diffuse sibilant rhonchi over both lungs. Electrocardiogram showed signs of ischemia. In the intensive care unit, he received bronchodilators, nitroglycerin, and aspirin. Bronchospasm increased, and then the patient was shocked, and developed cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, he was kept on mechanical ventilation and adrenaline infusion. He was scheduled for coronary angiography. The left system demonstrated stenosis of the mid-segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was totally occluded distally, stenosis of the left circumflex (LCx) with a mild plaque in its marginal branch. The right system demonstrated stenosis of the mid-segment of the right coronary artery (RCA), with diffusely diseased posterior descending artery (PDA) and posterolateral left ventricular branch (PLLV). Successful direct stenting was performed to the RCA. Angiography demonstrated worsening of the distal stenosis in the PLLV and complete occlusion of the PDA. Balloon dilatation of the PLLV was adequate, but dilatation of the PDA failed. Repeat angiography of the left system revealed an occluded LCx with critical stenosis of its marginal branch; nevertheless, the LAD was as before. Balloon dilatation of the distal LAD was attempted without improvement, yet, angiography therein, demonstrated "migration" of the stenoses in the LCx. The procedure was halted, adrenaline infusion discontinued, and an intra-aortic balloon pump inserted. The patient was discharged one day later. Follow-up angiography 6 months later demonstrated mild atherosclerotic coronary irregularities.

### Functional respiratory disorders in children [^117GZR7b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Functional respiratory disorders (FRDs) are those characterized by respiratory symptoms without anatomic or organic etiology. Clinicians caring for children encounter these disorders and should be familiar with diagnosis and treatment. FRDs encompass the habit cough syndrome and its variants, vocal cord dysfunction, hyperventilation disorders, functional dyspnea, and sighing syndrome. Failure to identify these disorders results in unnecessary testing and medication. This article reviews the clinical presentation, manifestation, and treatment of respiratory FRDs in children. How health care providers can successfully identify and treat these reversible conditions in the clinical setting is discussed.

### Respiratory noises: how useful are they clinically? [^113c5ywe]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Although clinicians place considerable weight on the identification of the various forms of noisy breathing, there are serious questions regarding both the accuracy (validity) and the reliability (repeatability) of these noises. To avoid diagnostic errors, clinicians need to consider the whole constellation of symptoms and signs, and not focus on the specific "type" of noise. Given the high error rate with "parent-reported wheeze" there is a need to reexamine the extensive literature on the epidemiology of wheeze in infants and young children, because parent-reported wheeze is unconfirmed by a clinician. It is obvious we need more high-quality research evidence to derive better evidence on the clinical utility of these noises, and their natural history.

### Cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia share extensive similarities: is It time to place them under a common umbrella? [^1159qs9E]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

The inherent impairment of the mucociliary escalator in CF and PCD raises the question of their distinction from all other bronchiectatic diseases. We believe that the extensive similarities in their clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic features, as summarized in Table 1, are sufficient to place them under a common umbrella and differentiate them from bronchiectasis attributed to other causes. We propose the term "non‐CF, non‐PCD bronchiectasis" or "non‐primary mucociliary disease bronchiectasis" to be used in the literature and the design of clinical and translational research, to clearly separate PCD in the same way as CF is separated from all other bronchiectatic diseases. This distinction will eventually enhance the personalized management of both PCD and the "non‐CF, non‐PCD" bronchiectasis patients in clinical practice.

### Acute and chronic cough [^116VjLoM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a normal protective mechanism which occurs many times every day. Cough with a viral infection lasts up to 2 weeks in 70–80% of children. Cough present for more than 4 weeks may be due to a recognized specific cause or non specific and considered protracted bronchitis. Chronic cough in children is different to that in adults and rarely due to GE reflux, postnasal drip or asthma. Treatment addresses the specific cause and symptomatic treatment is rarely needed or effective.

### A vagal reflex evoked by airway closure [^116dv7cA]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Sensory neurons that constitute the interoceptive nervous system relay information to the brain from vital organs in the body. Within the airways, sensory neurons provide essential feedback to control breathing, promote gas exchange, protect the airways through cough and laryngeal guarding reflexes, detect pathogens to induce sickness, and elicit perceptions of breathlessness, also known as dyspnoea or air hunger. Neuronal surveillance of the airways enables the detection of life-threatening inefficiencies in gas exchange, which can be a characteristic of cardiopulmonary disease. In response, neural circuits trigger compensatory reflexes such as gasps (quick and deep inspirations also called augmented breaths or sighs) to reopen closed airways, bring air into the lungs and relieve respiratory distress –. Gasps are triggered by many airway threats, including hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary congestion and thoracic compression, precede voluntary behaviours such as speaking and singing, and are often the first and last breaths of life. Neural circuits in the brain have been identified that coordinate the gasping motor response, but sensory pathways that lead to gasping, and their mechanisms of action, require additional exploration.

### Lung ultrasound: a useful tool in the assessment of the dyspnoeic patient in the emergency department. fact or fiction? [^117HpQn5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with respiratory distress present a frequent and challenging dilemma for emergency physicians (EPs). The accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying pathology is vitally important in these sick patients to ensure the best outcome and minimise harm from unnecessary treatments. Within the last decade, studies have shown lung ultrasonography (LU) to be valuable in the accurate diagnosis of a variety of lung pathologies, including cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, haemothorax and pneumonia. However, despite advances in techniques and the evidence for the use of LU in the diagnosis of respiratory pathology, it remains poorly understood and rarely used by EPs. This clinical review article provides an overview of LU and its relevance as a diagnostic aid to the detection of respiratory pathology in the Emergency Department (ED).

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Singing for lung health-a systematic review of the literature and consensus statement [^115uQLdm]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is a significant risk of multiple forms of bias across the studies with heterogeneous interventions and a limited number of participants. Performance bias was the biggest risk of bias in these studies as blinding participants is not possible. Some studies lacked information on randomisation procedure and so there was evidence of selection bias. Other studies included in the review were not controlled and therefore inherently carry a risk of bias. Moreover, attrition in the form of participant drop out was evident across studies. More information is required in the reporting of the singing exercises and other stages performed within studies to ascertain a potential therapeutic cause of this improved lung function measurements. Currently, it is not clear whether, when and how active abdominal contraction was encouraged during expirations or whether increased pressures through the hands on the upper abdomen were used as in active assistive mechanism (e.g. a manually assistive cough technique) or passive restrictive mechanism (e.g. a diaphragmatic breathing technique) in the study by Bonilha et al.for example. Nevertheless, repeated reporting of improvements in different outcomes across studies suggests that SLH improves health status in COPD patients in particular. No significant adverse events or side effects have been reported. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to quantify and understand its effects and impact, but participation in SLH has the potential to improve management of breathlessness and increase social participation.

### Are crackles an appropriate outcome measure for airway clearance therapy? [^116zXXsD]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is an urgent need to develop new outcome measures for respiratory therapy, to evaluate its effectiveness. Adventitious sounds generated from the lungs (crackles and wheezes), can now be quantified and characterized objectively with computer technology. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study designed to assess any change in lung crackles before and after a single session of airway clearance therapy.

Methods

Twenty-three stable bronchiectasis patients were recruited from United Kingdom out-patient clinics and treated with a single session of airway clearance therapy, using the active cycle of breathing technique. Sound recordings were made before and after the session at 7 anatomical chest locations. Computerized lung sound analysis was used to measure crackle parameters: 2-cycle deflection width (2CD), and crackle number per breath cycle (nBC). Perceived breathlessness, lung function, and oxygen saturation data were also recorded.

Results

Crackle mean 2CD and mean nBC increased post intervention. Sixteen participants (70%) showed a statistically significant difference in mean crackle 2CD before and after the session at ≥ 1 chest location. Thirteen (57%) participants had a difference between mean crackle 2CD before and after the intervention > 1 Smallest Real Difference (SRD, mean SRD = 2.23 ms) at ≥ 1 chest location. Differences in mean crackle nBC before and after the intervention did not exceed the SRD (mean SRD = 32 crackles per breath cycle) in any participant. Perceived breathlessness was significantly reduced post intervention; no significant changes were observed in either lung function or oxygen saturation.

Conclusions

Crackle duration (2CD) was found to change after a single session of airway clearance therapy, and shows promise as a new outcome measure for respiratory therapy interventions.

### Exacerbations in neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy are characterized by increased air trapping [^111HxKKp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI) presents with tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia, and often failure to thrive. The radiologic and physiologic findings in infants with NEHI have been well described with a distinct geographic pattern of ground-glass opacities on chest computerized tomography imaging and profound air-trapping on infant pulmonary function testing. Despite gradual improvement over time, unexplained exacerbation has been observed but not well characterized. We present physiological and radiological changes of increased air-trapping during acute exacerbations in two older children with NEHI who had previously experienced significant clinical improvement. These cases illustrate previously undescribed manifestations of NEHI in older children.

CHEST guideline — chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children: In children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease, a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in cough resolution between any intervention for GERD and placebo (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; p = 0.78), and proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. The panelists endorsed that treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD and that pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations; qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^112EoMEf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients. Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Chest wall abnormalities and their clinical significance in childhood [^115pfmKV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The thorax consists of the rib cage and the respiratory muscles. It houses and protects the various intrathoracic organs such as the lungs, heart, vessels, esophagus, nerves etc. It also serves as the so-called "respiratory pump" that generates the movement of air into the lungs while it prevents their total collapse during exhalation. In order to be performed these functions depend on the structural and functional integrity of the rib cage and of the respiratory muscles. Any condition (congenital or acquired) that may affect either one of these components is going to have serious implications on the function of the other. Furthermore, when these abnormalities occur early in life, they may affect the growth of the lungs themselves. The following article reviews the physiology of the respiratory pump, provides a comprehensive list of conditions that affect the thorax and describes their effect(s) on lung growth and function.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114tMyKL]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians) guideline overview — cough pathophysiology, measurement, and clinical significance are summarized as follows: Cough arises following activation of a complex sensorimotor reflex arc, and its distinctive sound is generated by the explosive release of trapped and pressurized intrathoracic air from the sudden opening of the vocal folds. Because cough is an easily described and recognizable physical act, patient surveys on the prevalence of cough have credibility, enabling development of cough-specific, patient-reported outcome tools by which physicians can assess the impact of cough on patients. Because the sound resulting from coughing has a typical acoustic waveform profile, software detection algorithms for automatic monitoring have been developed for cough counting. While cough in healthy individuals is physiologically important, it typically is of little clinical importance because it is normally a very uncommon event, yet it assumes importance as a defense mechanism when it helps clear excessive secretions and foreign material from the airways and as a factor in the spread of infection. The report states that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem and that the panel's purpose is to synthesize current knowledge to aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and to identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### The lung microbiota of healthy mice are highly variable, cluster by environment, and reflect variation in baseline lung innate immunity [^1113buSD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

The "gut-lung axis" is commonly invoked to explain the microbiome's influence on lung inflammation. Yet the lungs harbor their own microbiome, which is altered in respiratory disease. The relative influence of gut and lung bacteria on lung inflammation is unknown.

Objectives

To determine whether baseline lung immune tone reflects local (lung-lung) or remote (gut-lung) microbe-host interactions.

Methods

We compared lung, tongue, and cecal bacteria in 40 healthy, genetically identical, 10-week-old mice, using 16S ribosomal RNA gene quantification and sequencing. We measured inflammatory cytokines, using a multiplex assay of homogenized lung tissue. We compared lung bacteria in healthy mice treated with varied durations of systemic antibiotics.

Measurements and Main Results

Lung bacterial communities are highly variable among mice, cluster strongly by cage, shipment, and vendor, and are altered by antibiotics in a microbiologically predictable manner. Baseline lung concentrations of two key inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α and IL-4) are correlated with the diversity and community composition of lung bacterial communities. Lung concentrations of these inflammatory cytokines correlate more strongly with variation in lung bacterial communities than with that of the gut or mouth.

Conclusions

In the lungs of healthy mice, baseline innate immune tone more strongly reflects local (lung-lung) microbe-host interactions than remote (gut-lung) microbe-host interactions. Our results independently confirm the existence and immunologic significance of the murine lung microbiome, even in health. Variation in lung microbiota is likely an important, underappreciated source of experimental and clinical variability. The lung microbiome is an unexplored therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory lung disease.

### Bronchi, bronchial tree,&lungs-SEER training modulestraining.seer.cancer.gov › anatomy › respiratory › passages › bronchi… [^112skxad]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchi, Bronchial Tree, & Lungs Bronchi and Bronchial Tree In the mediastinum, at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi. The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli. The cartilage and mucous membrane of the primary bronchi are similar to that in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the smallest bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple cuboidal epithelium to simple squamous epithelium. Lungs The two lungs, which contain all the components of the bronchial tree beyond the primary bronchi, occupy most of the space in the thoracic cavity.

The lungs are soft and spongy because they are mostly air spaces surrounded by the alveolar cells and elastic connective tissue. They are separated from each other by the mediastinum, which contains the heart. The only point of attachment for each lung is at the hilum, or root, on the medial side. This is where the bronchi, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves enter the lungs. The right lung is shorter, broader, and has a greater volume than the left lung. It is divided into three lobes and each lobe is supplied by one of the secondary bronchi. The left lung is longer and narrower than the right lung. It has an indentation, called the cardiac notch, on its medial surface for the apex of the heart. The left lung has two lobes. Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered serous membrane, called the pleura. The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of the lung. At the hilum, the visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura that lines the wall of the thorax.

The small space between the visceral and parietal pleurae is the pleural cavity. It contains a thin film of serous fluid that is produced by the pleura. The fluid acts as a lubricant to reduce friction as the two layers slide against each other, and it helps to hold the two layers together as the lungs inflate and deflate.

### Management of swimming-induced pulmonary edema… [^115ZAXW5]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

His initial oxygen saturation was 70 percent on room air and improved to 86 percent on three liters of oxygen via nasal cannula during ambulance transfer. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on three liters of oxygen with improved shortness of breath and resolved hemoptysis. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral rhonchi. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable with all vital signs being normal. Electrocardiogram, complete blood count, electrolytes, creatine kinase, troponin, and coagulation studies were all within normal limits. A chest radiograph showed fluffy perihilar infiltrates bilaterally. A chest radiograph taken several hours later showed resolving infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with swimming-induced pulmonary edema and discharged.

While the exact pathophysiology of SIPE remains uncertain, it is believed to be related to exertion, immersion in cold water, and overhydration. The body's normal response to exercise is to increase cardiac output to meet the increased oxygen demand. Although an increased cardiac output is known to cause pulmonary edema in racehorses, this increase is rarely enough to produce such an effect in humans. 1 Cold-water immersion is instrumental in this process because the peripheral vasculature constricts to divert blood away from the extremities in an effort to maintain the core body temperature. This results in a central pooling of blood, leading to an increased preload, increased pulmonary artery pressure, and an increased cardiac output. The vasoconstriction also causes an increase in afterload, which leads to an increase in pulmonary vasculature resistance.

2 It is believed that this degree of hydration led to a fluid overload that contributed to the onset of pulmonary edema by increasing the pulmonary capillary pressure. 2 Patients may present with symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachypnea, and confusion with hypoxia, after exertional cold water activity such as swimming and scuba diving.
3. Treatment for patients with SIPE consists primarily of supportive measures such as removing the patient from the wet and/or cold environment and providing supplemental oxygen. Although useful in treating pulmonary edema in racehorses, diuretics are typically not necessary because patients tend to show relief of symptoms soon after being placed on supplemental oxygen. 4 Full resolution of radiographic findings typically occurs within 24 to 48 hours.

MENDELSON'S syndrome, or peptic-aspiration pneumonia, was first described in obstetrical cases by Mendelson1 in 1946. Classically, there is a history of vomiting after inhalation anesthesia, either during the operation or in the early postoperative period. Two to five hours after aspiration there is a dramatic onset of cyanosis, dyspnea, tachycardia, and shock. 2 Examination of the patient shows no localized signs of lung disease but generalized adventitious sounds and bronchospasm. The condition simulates pulmonary edema with rales, wheezes, and rhonchi throughout both lungs. There is a bloody, frothy sputum and marked pulmonary congestion. A very high pulse and respiratory rate are common, and gross pulmonary edema may supervene, with a rapidly deteriorating course resulting in death from cardiac failure. X-ray of the chest shows soft patchy mottling scattered through the lung fields but no evidence of lung collapse. Postmortem examination of the lungs will show gross swelling of.
