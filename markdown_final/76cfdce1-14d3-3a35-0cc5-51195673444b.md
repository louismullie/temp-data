## Question

Side effects of fibrates

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of fibrates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanism to anticipate adverse effects. Then, I should verify common adverse effects from high-quality sources. Next, I will examine serious adverse effects, including myopathy, hepatotoxicity, renal effects, and gallstone disease. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions, especially with statins, and quantify risk differences. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and practical counseling points, and I will double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism, because adverse effects often track with pharmacology. Fibrates are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) agonists that upregulate lipoprotein lipase, downregulate apoC-III, and increase fatty acid oxidation, producing robust triglyceride lowering and modest HDL-C increases, which helps explain effects on muscle, liver, and renal handling of creatinine [^99bd58c8] [^61abcbab].

> I will now examine common adverse effects. Wait, let me verify the frequencies from authoritative sources. The FDA labeling for fenofibrate lists common reactions including abdominal pain, back pain, constipation, headache, nausea, rhinitis, rash or urticaria, and mild creatine kinase elevations, with transaminase increases also reported, which aligns with clinical experience and guideline summaries of gastrointestinal upset and myalgias as frequent complaints [^fe38726f] [^99bd58c8] [^f5a95a29].

> Next, I should review serious adverse effects, starting with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about class effects. Large meta-analyses and regulatory data show that serious muscle toxicity is uncommon overall but is substantially higher with gemfibrozil than fenofibrate, particularly in combination with statins; fenofibrate is generally preferred when combining with statins, and the absolute risk with fenofibrate plus statin appears low in trials like ACCORD, though vigilance is warranted in high-risk patients [^c4671374] [^13966546] [^e36653b8] [^822c0534].

> I need to check hepatotoxicity next. The FDA labeling for fenofibric acid notes dose-related ALT/AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in about 5.3% on fenofibrate versus 1.1% on placebo in pooled trials, with rare reports of serious drug-induced liver injury; guidelines recommend baseline and periodic liver enzyme monitoring, holding therapy if enzymes exceed 3× ULN and resolving before rechallenge at a lower dose [^9076aa1d] [^5c511621] [^9076aa1d].

> Let me consider renal effects carefully. Fenofibrate commonly causes reversible increases in serum creatinine of about 10–20% via hemodynamic or transporter-mediated effects, typically normalizing within 6–8 weeks after discontinuation; this is not associated with progressive renal decline in trials, but I should confirm dose adjustment in renal impairment and avoid use in severe renal dysfunction, with some data suggesting gemfibrozil may not raise creatinine as much, though that observation should be interpreted cautiously [^c4671374] [^f2719571] [^f5a95a29] [^a461757a].

> I should confirm gallstone risk. Fibrates increase cholesterol excretion into bile and reduce bile acid excretion, which can promote cholelithiasis; labels advise maintaining suspicion for biliary symptoms and discontinuing if gallstones are found, reinforcing the need to avoid fibrates in patients with gallbladder disease [^9fb5eabf] [^9076aa1d] [^f5a95a29].

> But wait, what about hematologic and other less common effects. The FDA warns of rare hematologic abnormalities including anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis, and advises CBC monitoring during the first year; additionally, fenofibrate has been associated with paradoxical HDL-C decreases in a subset of patients, so I should double-check HDL-C within the first few months and reconsider therapy if a substantial drop occurs [^9fb5eabf] [^a7c53240].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions, especially with statins. Gemfibrozil inhibits statin glucuronidation and OATP1B1, markedly increasing active statin exposure and rhabdomyolysis risk; in contrast, fenofibrate does not meaningfully impair statin metabolism, making it the preferred fibrate when combination therapy is indicated, with ACCORD and FDA analyses supporting a much lower rhabdomyolysis signal with fenofibrate plus statin than with gemfibrozil plus statin [^13966546] [^e36653b8] [^822c0534].

> Hold on, I should verify the quantitative risk difference. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data show approximately 4.5 rhabdomyolysis reports per million prescriptions with fenofibrate plus statin versus 87 per million with gemfibrozil plus statin, and ACCORD reported no excess myopathy with simvastatin plus fenofibrate versus simvastatin alone, which reassures me that fenofibrate combinations are acceptably safe when clinically indicated with appropriate monitoring [^e36653b8] [^13966546].

> I need to ensure I cover other important interactions. Fibrates potentiate warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, so INR should be checked frequently when starting or adjusting a fibrate; fibrates also interact with immunosuppressants and bile acid sequestrants, and coadministration with colchicine can increase myopathy risk, so I should reconcile the medication list carefully before prescribing [^9fb5eabf] [^6a88881a] [^5c511621].

> Let me think about special populations and monitoring. In chronic kidney disease, avoid fibrates when eGFR is below 30 mL/min and reduce dose as renal function declines; in older adults, start low and go slow given higher myopathy risk; in diabetes, monitor for creatinine rises and consider the microvascular benefits seen with fenofibrate in FIELD, while acknowledging that ASCVD outcome benefits are inconsistent overall; in pregnancy, avoid fibrates except for severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis risk where gemfibrozil may be considered after the first trimester with specialist input [^f5a95a29] [^85248730] [^379e948e] [^822c0534].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations. For children with severe hypertriglyceridemia, expert guidance allows fibrates only with lipid specialist oversight given limited pediatric data and the need to balance pancreatitis risk against long-term safety uncertainties, so I must not generalize adult safety to pediatrics without specialist coordination [^6533d51b] [^274918c3].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and monitoring. Before starting a fibrate, obtain baseline AST/ALT, creatinine/eGFR, and CBC; recheck liver enzymes in about 4 weeks and periodically thereafter, hold if ALT or AST exceed 3× ULN; monitor creatinine after initiation and after dose changes, recognizing expected reversible increases with fenofibrate; and advise patients to report unexplained muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine promptly, with CPK checked if symptoms occur [^5c511621] [^9076aa1d] [^9fb5eabf].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting data before concluding. While some older or lower-credibility sources suggest broadly increased adverse events with fibrates, contemporary high-quality evidence and guidelines indicate that when used appropriately — especially with fenofibrate rather than gemfibrozil, with attention to renal function and drug interactions — serious adverse effects are uncommon and most adverse effects are mild, reversible, and manageable with monitoring and dose adjustment [^c4671374] [^13966546] [^e36653b8].

> In summary, fibrates are generally well tolerated; common effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, rash, and mild CK elevations, while serious risks include myopathy (far more with gemfibrozil than fenofibrate), reversible transaminase elevations, reversible creatinine increases, rare hematologic abnormalities, and gallstone formation; careful selection of agent, dose adjustment in renal impairment, avoidance of high-risk combinations, and guideline-concordant monitoring mitigate these risks and allow safe, effective use when clinically indicated [^fe38726f] [^c4671374] [^13966546] [^f5a95a29].

Fibrates are **generally well tolerated** [^c4671374], but clinicians should monitor for key adverse effects. The most common are **gastrointestinal symptoms** (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) [^fe38726f] and **myopathy** (myalgias, elevated CK, rare rhabdomyolysis) [^6a88881a], with risk rising when combined with statins — especially gemfibrozil [^e36653b8] [^14521100]. Fenofibrate is preferred for statin combinations because it does not inhibit statin metabolism [^e36653b8] [^13966546]. Fibrates can cause **reversible increases in serum creatinine** [^c4671374] and homocysteine [^b828b02d], and may raise liver enzymes [^fe38726f]; baseline and periodic renal and hepatic monitoring are advised [^5c511621]. Less common risks include gallstones [^9fb5eabf], pancreatitis [^9fb5eabf], and paradoxical HDL lowering [^a7c53240]; avoid fibrates in severe renal impairment, active liver disease, or gallbladder disease [^5c511621] [^9fb5eabf].

---

## Common side effects

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia are the most frequently reported side effects [^fe38726f] [^99bd58c8].

- **Myopathy**: Myalgias, muscle weakness, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels are common, particularly when fibrates are combined with statins [^6a88881a] [^14521100].

- **Hepatic effects**: Mild elevations in liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are observed in some patients [^fe38726f] [^9076aa1d].

- **Renal effects**: Reversible increases in serum creatinine and homocysteine levels are common, particularly with fenofibrate [^c4671374] [^b828b02d].

---

## Serious adverse effects

- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Although rare, rhabdomyolysis can occur, especially with concomitant statin therapy, particularly gemfibrozil [^e36653b8] [^14521100].

- **Gallstones**: Fibrates increase cholesterol excretion into bile, raising the risk of cholelithiasis [^9fb5eabf] [^9076aa1d].

- **Pancreatitis**: Rare cases of pancreatitis have been reported, particularly in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia [^9fb5eabf].

- **Paradoxical HDL lowering**: Fenofibrate can rarely cause significant reductions in HDL cholesterol, necessitating monitoring of lipid profiles [^a7c53240] [^9fb5eabf].

---

## Drug interactions

- **Statins**: Gemfibrozil significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when combined with statins due to inhibition of statin metabolism [^e36653b8] [^14521100]. Fenofibrate is preferred for combination therapy with statins [^e36653b8] [^13966546].

- **Warfarin**: Fibrates enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close INR monitoring is required [^9fb5eabf] [^100e2269].

- **Colchicine**: Co-administration with fibrates increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [^6a88881a].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **severe renal impairment**, **active liver disease**, **gallbladder disease**, and **hypersensitivity to fibrates** [^c3e8f8c9] [^9fb5eabf]. Use with caution in patients with **mild to moderate renal impairment**, adjusting the dose as necessary [^b828b02d] [^f2719571]. Baseline and periodic monitoring of **liver enzymes**, **renal function**, and **CK levels** is recommended, especially when combined with statins [^5c511621] [^f2719571].

---

## Clinical management of side effects

- **Myopathy**: Discontinue fibrate therapy if significant muscle symptoms or markedly elevated CK levels occur [^6a88881a].

- **Hepatic effects**: Discontinue fibrates if liver enzymes persistently exceed three times the upper limit of normal [^c3e8f8c9] [^9076aa1d].

- **Renal effects**: Monitor renal function regularly, and adjust the dose or discontinue therapy if significant creatinine elevation occurs [^b828b02d] [^f2719571].

---

Fibrates are effective for managing dyslipidemia but require **careful monitoring** due to potential side effects. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, myopathy, and reversible renal and hepatic abnormalities. Serious adverse effects, such as rhabdomyolysis and gallstones, are rare but require vigilance, particularly with drug interactions.

### The need for a large-scale trial of fibrate therapy in diabetes: the rationale and design of the fenofibrate intervention and event lowering in diabetes (FIELD) study [^8d6ce578]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2004). Low credibility.

Why a large trial of fibrates?

For patients with type 2 diabetes and its typical dyslipidaemia, many physicians believe that fibrates are the logical first choice of drug treatment. The fibrates have been in clinical use for a long time, being well tolerated and with few short-term side-effects. Fenofibrate has been widely used and marketed for more than 20 years and is an effective agent for reducing plasma triglyceride and raising HDL cholesterol. Although the effects on lipid fractions may vary with the population under study, a fall of 15% or more in total cholesterol, mediated through a reduction in LDL cholesterol, is often seen with long-term use. In parallel, HDL cholesterol elevation of 10–15% is common, together with large reductions in plasma triglycerides of 30–40%. In addition, a reduction in plasma fibrinogen of about 15% has been observed.

FIELD is designed to provide the first properly randomized evidence as to whether the substantial effects of fenofibrate confer a benefit on clinical cardiovascular events in persons with type 2 diabetes. A clearly favourable result might be expected to help physicians determine which type of lipid-modifying drug therapy is likely to be most cost-effective for such people.

What are the possible side effects of ezetimibe tablets?

Ezetimibe tablets may cause serious side effects including:

increased liver enzymes. An increase in liver enzymes can happen in people taking ezetimibe tablets alone or with statins. Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment. Your healthcare provider may need to change or stop your treatment with ezetimibe tablets because of an increase in liver enzymes.
muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness (myopathy). Muscle problems, including muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) can happen. Tell your healthcare provider right away if:Your chances of getting muscle problems are higher if you are also taking statins or fibrates. The most common side effects of ezetimibe tablets taken alone include:

 The most common side effects of ezetimibe tablets taken with a statin include: Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of ezetimibe tablets. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800- FDA-1088.
you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness, feel more tired than usual, or fever.
you have muscle problems that do not go away even after your healthcare provider has advised you to stop taking ezetimibe tablets. Your healthcare provider may do further tests to diagnose the cause of your muscle problems.

### Expert commentary: the safety of fibrates in lipid-lowering therapy [^7a37f075]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The use of fibrates in the management of lipoprotein disorders has a history dating back to the mid-1960s. This group of drugs has now been tested in several large long-term trials with cardiovascular end points. Overall, there is good evidence for the reduction of cardiovascular disease in primary prevention studies and in those of subjects with manifest disease. More recent trials have suffered from high interference due to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) introduction, particularly in their placebo control groups. However, there is very good evidence for overall safety from a combined study of > 20,000 patients in these controlled clinical trials lasting approximately 5 years. Abdominal pain has been observed more frequently in the statin vs placebo group. Myopathy, liver enzyme elevations, and cholecystitis have been potential adverse reactions of interest. However, these have occurred at a very low rate and are rarely found to be statistically more frequent in the active-treatment group compared with the subjects taking placebo. The recent Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study found a slightly higher incidence of pancreatitis, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Small creatinine and homocysteine elevations are observed in many patients taking fibrates, and the effect of this on long-term outcomes is under study. The FIELD study also described a significant reduction in the rates of progression of proteinuria and vascular retinopathy with fibrate therapy. To date, there has been no study exclusive to patients with elevated triglycerides, raising the question of the potential benefit of these drugs in patients with the lipid abnormalities most effectively treated with fibrates.

### Safety considerations with fibrate therapy [^b828b02d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Fibrates are an important class of drugs for the management of dyslipidemia. This class of drugs is generally well tolerated but is infrequently associated with several safety issues. Fibrates, most likely by an effect mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, may reversibly increase creatinine and homocysteine but are not associated with an increased risk for renal failure in clinical trials. Fibrates are associated with a slightly increased risk (< 1.0%) for myopathy, cholelithiasis, and venous thrombosis. In clinical trials, patients without elevated triglycerides and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, fibrates are associated with an increase in noncardiovascular mortality. In combination with statins, gemfibrozil generally should be avoided. The preferred option is fenofibrate, which is not associated with an inhibition of statin metabolism. Clinicians are advised to measure serum creatinine before fibrate use and adjust the dose accordingly for renal impairment. Routine monitoring of creatinine is not required, but if a patient has a clinically important increase in creatinine, and other potential causes of creatinine increase have been excluded, consideration should be given to discontinuing fibrate therapy or reducing the dose.

### Pharmacokinetic interactions between statins and fibrates [^369da7f8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Concomitant use of a fibrate and a statin may offer a therapeutic advantage to patients with dyslipidemia, especially in patients whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is controlled by statins but whose high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides, or both, are not within goal. However, concern about drug-drug interactions may preclude optimal use of combination statin-fibrate therapy. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics between statins and fibrates, addressing risks associated with drug-drug interactions and combination therapy.

### Is there a role for fibrates in the management of dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome? [^ebf71a57]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

The outcomes of fibrate trials have varied: positive with gemfibrozil in the primary prevention Helsinki Heart Study and the secondary prevention VA-HIT trial; positive with reservations in the primary prevention WHO trial (clofibrate); and mixed with bezafibrate in the secondary prevention BIP study and with fenofibrate in the combined primary and secondary prevention FIELD study. Overall, the mixed results, combined with potential for adverse effects when given in combination with statins, have limited the use of these fibrates as cardioprotective agents. However, post hoc analyses of several of the fibrate studies have shown that people with features of the metabolic syndrome, particularly overweight people with high plasma triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL cholesterol, derive a disproportionately large reduction in cardiovascular events when treated with these agents. Thus, there is a strong case for the use of a fibrate to reduce the cardiovascular risk in overweight people with high triglyceride and low HDL-C. However, it should be noted that such people also have their cardiovascular risk reduced by statin therapy. It remains to be determined whether the combination of a fibrate plus statin reduces the risk beyond that achieved with a statin alone.

### Effects of fibrates on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4671374]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Several clinical trials have reported inconsistent findings for the effect of fibrates on cardiovascular risk. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of fibrates on major clinical outcomes.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for trials published between 1950 and March, 2010. We included prospective randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of fibrates on cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo. Summary estimates of relative risk (RR) reductions were calculated with a random effects model. Outcomes analysed were major cardiovascular events, coronary events, stroke, heart failure, coronary revascularisation, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, non-vascular death, sudden death, new onset albuminuria, and drug-related adverse events.

Findings

We identified 18 trials providing data for 45 058 participants, including 2870 major cardiovascular events, 4552 coronary events, and 3880 deaths. Fibrate therapy produced a 10% RR reduction (95% CI 0–18) for major cardiovascular events (p = 0.048) and a 13% RR reduction (7–19) for coronary events (p < 0.0001), but had no benefit on stroke (-3%, -16 to 9; p = 0.69). We noted no effect of fibrate therapy on the risk of all-cause mortality (0%, -8 to 7; p = 0.92), cardiovascular mortality (3%, -7 to 12; p = 0.59), sudden death (11%, -6 to 26; p = 0.19), or non-vascular mortality (-10%, -21 to 0.5; p = 0.063). Fibrates reduced the risk of albuminuria progression by 14% (2–25; p = 0.028). Serious drug-related adverse events were not significantly increased by fibrates (17 413 participants, 225 events; RR 1.21, 0.91–1.61; p = 0.19), although increases in serum creatinine concentrations were common (1.99, 1.46–2.70; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Fibrates can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events predominantly by prevention of coronary events, and might have a role in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events and in those with combined dyslipidaemia.

### Fibrates for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^d39aa9f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrates are effective for modifying atherogenic dyslipidaemia, and particularly for lowering serum triglycerides. However, evidence that fibrates reduce mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), or overall mortality and morbidity, in the primary prevention of CVD is lacking.

Objectives

This Cochrane Review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of fibrates versus placebo or usual care or fibrates plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science (all from inception to 19 May 2016). We searched four clinical trial registers (last searched on 3 August 2016) with the help of an experienced professional librarian. We searched the databases to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effects of fibrate therapy in the primary prevention of CVD events. We did not impose any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We aimed to include all RCTs comparing the effects of fibrate monotherapy versus placebo or usual care, or fibrates plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone. Included studies had a follow-up of at least six months for the primary prevention of CVD events. We excluded trials with clofibrate, because it was withdrawn from the market in 2002.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potential study inclusion. Two review authors independently retrieved the full-text papers and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for aggregate data on primary and secondary outcomes. We tested for heterogeneity with the Cochrane Q-test and used the I 2 statistic to measure inconsistency of treatment effects across studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and used the GRADE profiler software (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5 to create 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified six eligible trials including 16,135 individuals. The mean age of trial populations varied across trials; between 47.3 and 62.3 years. Four trials included individuals with diabetes mellitus type 2 only. The mean treatment duration and follow-up of participants across trials was 4.8 years. We judged the risks of selection and performance bias to be low; risks of detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias were unclear. Reporting of adverse effects by included trials was very limited; that is why we used discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects as a proxy for adverse effects. Patients treated with fibrates had a reduced risk for the combined primary outcome of CVD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke compared to patients on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate-quality of evidence). For secondary outcomes we found RRs for fibrate therapy compared with placebo of 0.79 for combined coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate-quality of evidence); 1.01 for overall mortality (95% CI 0.81 to 1.26; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low-quality of evidence); 1.01 for non-CVD mortality (95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low-quality of evidence); and 1.38 for discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects (95% CI 0.71 to 2.68; participants = 4805; studies = 3; I² = 74%; very low-quality of evidence). Data on quality of life were not available from any trial. Trials that evaluated fibrates in the background of statins (2 studies) showed no benefits in preventing cardiovascular events.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that fibrates lower the risk for cardiovascular and coronary events in primary prevention, but the absolute treatment effects in the primary prevention setting are modest (absolute risk reductions < 1%). There is low-quality evidence that fibrates have no effect on overall or non-CVD mortality. Very low-quality evidence suggests that fibrates are not associated with increased risk for adverse effects.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f5a95a29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Fibrates — clinical effects and precautions indicate that trials have not shown overall mortality benefit, though in moderate hypertriglyceridemia they decrease composite cardiovascular events without reducing mortality; treating patients with triglycerides below 200 mg/dl does not confer benefit. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort and possibly more cholesterol gallstones; fibrates are contraindicated with liver and gall bladder disease and require great caution in renal insufficiency due to reversible creatinine increases. Fenofibrate is described as the preferred fibrate for use with a statin, with a potential interaction with warfarin requiring careful monitoring. For pregnancy, gemfibrozil can be considered in very severe hypertriglyceridemia beginning in the second trimester in women at risk of pancreatitis.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^ba473845]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of side effects observed after run‐in phases of clinical trials is low and includes myalgias (1.1% to 5.0%), creatine kinase elevation (0.9%), and transaminitis (1.4%). Each of these adverse effects can be exacerbated with concomitant use of fibrates, immnosuppressive medications, and antifungals or other antibiotics. Although some reports have raised concerns regarding adverse long‐term effects on cancer incidence, cognitive function, and DM, careful evaluation of existing scientific evidence does not support an impact of statins on the incidence of cancer or cognitive decline. – One recent study found that increased risk of new‐onset DM was limited to patients who were already prediabetic and that the benefits of statin therapy in these patients still greatly outweighed the risk associated with new‐onset DM.

When statin medications are not tolerated due to mild side effects, a drug holiday for 2 to 4 weeks should be considered, followed by reinitiation with the same statin, a reduced dose of the same statin with eventual uptitration, or even less frequent dosing (every other day or twice to thrice weekly). A switch to a statin associated with fewer musculoskeletal side effects such as fluvastatinor a more hydrophilic statin (eg, pravastatin, rosuvastatin) may help alleviate side effects. Given the strong evidence for statins, trying at least 3 different statin medications or referring the patient to a lipid clinic with specific expertise is recommended before labeling a patient as intolerant of statin therapy.

Nonstatin lipid-lowering agents — fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) may be coadministered with statins when warranted for complex dyslipidemias or severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, or diabetes mellitus; in the United States, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, and fenofibric acid are the only fibrates approved for clinical use, and both statins and fibrates have been independently associated with a risk of muscle-related toxicity as monotherapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^61abcbab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Treating mixed dyslipidemias: why and how [^74583bc3]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with only mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values but low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and/or high triglyceride levels are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) have been shown to slow coronary heart disease (CHD) progression, reduce CHD events in patients with low HDL-C levels, and raise HDL-C concentrations in patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Some, but not all trials of fibrates have shown benefit in patients with low HDL-C levels. Combination therapy with a statin plus either a fibrate or niacin is effective in improving the entire lipid profile, but may increase cost and side effects.

### Efficacy and safety of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-increasing compounds: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ac622637]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this research was to estimate the efficacy and safety of current high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)-increasing drugs.

Background

Epidemiologic evidence has shown that HDL-C is inversely related to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, the evidence for reducing CHD risk by raising HDL-C is thin, predominantly due to the paucity of effective and safe HDL-increasing drugs.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials with fibrates and niacin, published between 1966 through February 2004 (MEDLINE), were retrieved. Information on treatment, baseline characteristics, serum lipids, end points, and side-effects were independently abstracted by two authors using a standardized protocol.

Results

Data from 53 trials (16,802 subjects) using fibrates and 30 trials (4,749 subjects) using niacin were included. Random-effects model showed 11% versus 10% reduction in total cholesterol, 36% versus 20% reduction in triglycerides, 8% versus 14% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 10% versus 16% increase in HDL-C for fibrates and niacin, respectively. Apart from flushes in the niacin group, both fibrates and niacin were shown to be well-tolerated and safe. Fibrates reduced the risk for major coronary events by 25% (95% confidence interval 10% to 38%), whereas current available data for niacin indicate a 27% reduction.

Conclusions

Fibrates reduce major coronary events and increase HDL-C levels without significant toxicity. Niacin has a more potent effect on HDL-C levels, whereas data on cardiovascular event rate reduction are limited. Future studies need to evaluate whether additional HDL increase by fibrates or particularly newer niacin formulations on top of statin therapy translates into further event reduction in high-risk subjects, without significant toxicity.

### Efficacy and safety of statin and fibrate combination therapy in lipid management [^27668931]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Adequate control of hyperlipidemia is of paramount importance for prevention of vascular events. Statins and fibrates are well established treatments for hyperlipidemia. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. Statin+fibrate therapy should be considered if monotherapy or adding other drugs (e.g. cholesterol absorption inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid) did not achieve lipid targets or is impractical. The current article focuses on recent studies highlighting the beneficial effects of this combination.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^abc4f2f3]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — fibrate safety considerations: Use of fibrates can be associated with myalgias and heartburn, and an elevation in serum creatinine is frequently observed, which is typically reversible and not associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate; similarly, an increase in bilirubin can occur, and fibrates can cause elevation of transaminases which is also typically reversible. The use of fibrates has not been studied in patients with decompensated liver disease and should be avoided, and long-term safety of fibrates in patients with PBC warrants additional studies.

### Residual macrovascular risk in 2013: what have we learned? [^379e948e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

An ancillary study of the ACCORD Lipid trial (supported by the R 3 i), which evaluated effects on postprandial lipaemia, provides a possible explanation as to why the benefit of fibrates is specific to patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Compared with the simvastatin monotherapy group, treatment with the combination of fenofibrate plus simvastatin led to significant reductions in postprandial exposure to triglycerides and apoB48, indicating a decrease in the accumulation of atherogenic, intestinally-derived TRL remnants. This effect of fenofibrate was selective to patients with elevated fasting triglycerides at baseline. Added to this, there is also evidence of benefit with fenofibrate on diabetes-related microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.

Despite this favourable profile of macro- and microvascular benefits, the efficacy of the current fibrates may be limited by uncertainties relating to the optimal level of PPARα-agonism, agonist-specific biologic responses, and the side effects of current synthetic agonists. Of relevance for patients already on statin therapy, is the increased risk of muscle-related symptoms with the combination of a statin and certain fibrates, specifically gemfibrozil. This does not appear to be an issue with fenofibrate, probably due to the lack of interference of fenofibrate on statin pharmacokinetics. Indeed, there was no adverse signal for myopathy in the ACCORD Lipid trial. Other commonly reported adverse effects include increases in homocysteine, creatinine and liver enzymes, markers of CVD, renal disease and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. In the ACCORD Lipid study, 48% of statin-treated patients who received the full dose of fenofibrate (160 mg/day) for at least 30 days before the 4-month follow-up showed > 20% increase from baseline in serum creatinine (versus 9% in the placebo group) at this visit. Both the ACCORD Lipid and the FIELD studies subsequently showed that increases in serum creatinine associated with fenofibrate were reversible, with levels returning to those observed in the placebo group about 6–8 weeks after cessation of treatment, and did not appear to detrimentally influence risk for CVD or deterioration in renal function. In the FIELD study, despite increasing creatinine levels, fenofibrate treatment was associated with less renal function decline, as shown by a slower rate of loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate over 5 years compared with placebo. However, in high-risk older patients with impaired renal function receiving multiple treatments likely to affect renal haemodynamics, this may be a relevant consideration.

### Effect of fibrates on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review [^435c635a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Fibrates might represent a viable treatment option for patients who do not meet their target low-density lipoprotein levels on statins or who are resistant or intolerant to statins. New data from fibrate trials can be synthesized with the existing literature to better estimate their effects.

Methods

We systematically searched the literature to identify randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of fibrates on lipid profiles or cardiovascular outcomes. We estimated the effect of fibrates on the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality using random effects models.

Results

Compared with placebo, fibrates were associated with greater reductions in total cholesterol (range: -101.3 mg/dL to -5.0 mg/dL) and triglycerides (range: -321.3 mg/dL to -20.8 mg/dL), and a greater increase in high-density lipoprotein (range: +1.1 mg/dL to +17.9 mg/dL) in all trials. Fibrates tended to be associated with a greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein (range: -76.3 mg/dL to +38.7 mg/dL) than placebo, although these results were not consistent across all trials. Fibrates were more efficacious than placebo at preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.89), but not all-cause mortality (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–1.15).

Conclusion

In addition to improving lipid profiles, fibrates are associated with an important decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction, but do not substantially affect all-cause mortality. Potential applications include treatment for patients with statin resistance or isolated hypertriglyceridemia, or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies.

### Comparative effects of lipid-lowering therapies [^fd9e468d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutic drug classes have been developed in an effort to ever more precisely and intensively modulate lipid metabolism. Statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, and niacin exert their effects via different mechanisms and afford physicians the opportunity to beneficially impact multiple pathways in patients. When used alone or in combination, these drugs decrease risk for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. There are strong clinical trial data to support of the use of lipid-lowering therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention. This article (1) discusses the mechanisms of action of antilipidemic medications, (2) reviews dosing regimens and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class, (3) assesses risk for drug interactions, and (4) reviews the clinical trial evidence used to support the use of particular antilipidemic medications in specific physiologic settings. The incidence of dyslipidemia is rising worldwide. This trend portends an ever-growing need for the aggressive and judicious use of different antilipidemic medication(s) in patients at risk for all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

### Fibrates are an essential part of modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal: spotlight on atherogenic dyslipidemia and residual risk reduction [^0fe4bcf9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The risk associated with high triglycerides and low HDL may be eliminated by fibrate. Among major fibrates, bezafibrate appears to have the strongest and fenofibrate the weakest effect on HDL-C (Figure 4). As compared with statin monotherapy (effective mainly on LDL-C levels and plaque stabilization), the association of a statin with a fibrate will also have a major impact on triglycerides, HDL and LDL particle size. Moreover, in the case of bezafibrate one could expect neutralizing of the adverse pro-diabetic effect of statins. Though muscle pain and myositis is an issue in statin/fibrate treatment, adverse interaction appears to occur to a significantly greater extent when gemfibrozil is administered. However, bezafibrate and fenofibrate seem to be safer and better tolerated.

Figure 4
Effect of different fibrates on HDL-C level (vs. placebo), HDL-C elevations vs. baseline during a treatment usually were significantly higher.

Particularly, plasma concentration of statins are markedly increased by gemfibrozil but not by fenofibrate or bezafibrate. So, gemfibrozil, which is a good "evidence-based" fibrate for monotherapy, apears to be a problematic in the "statins world". Unfortunately, safety concerns about gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these useful agents.

In a fibrate/statin combined therapy, the statin should probably be taken at the evening and the fibrate in the morning to avoid matched peak dose concentrations. Anyway, although in clinical trials the rate of adverse events on combination was not significantly greater compared with monotherapy, clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients who receive combined treatment could be prudent.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^36eec0e4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

### Effect of drugs on high-density lipoprotein [^ad14c634]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III found evidence for raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) events supports use of HDL-C to help modify low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering goals, but not to establish new HDL-C-focused treatment recommendations. However, the HDL-C-raising clinical trials provide important lessons to help guide clinical management of dyslipidemic patients. The fibrate outcome trials demonstrate that these drugs reduce CAD events, but not death. Their greatest benefit is in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high triglycerides, small LDL particles, and low HDL-C. Unfortunately, there is no information on whether these drugs extend risk reduction when added to a statin. The niacin outcome trials also demonstrate a reduction in CAD events, both with niacin monotherapy and in combination with a statin. Unfortunately, most of the trials are too small to address the impact of niacin on mortality. In the clinic, statins are most useful for their LDL-C-lowering efficacy, although their modest HDL-C-raising effects can be important in CAD risk reduction. In most cases, other therapies will need to be added to a statin to augment HDL-C-raising, and the most effective drug for achieving this is niacin. The greatest challenge with the use of niacin is managing the vasodilatory side effects, but this can be effectively done in the majority of patients. Fibrates can also be added to a statin for management of atherogenic dyslipidemia. These drugs are among the most effective triglyceride-lowering drugs, and they also increase HDL-C levels, but not as much as niacin. The biggest concern with combining a fibrate with a statin is the enhanced risk of severe muscle toxicity, but this appears to be a problem unique to gemfibrozil, and not fenofibrate. In the research center, new approaches are under development for enhancing the availability of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and nascent HDL particles to promote enhanced reverse cholesterol transport, increasing the production of transport molecules, in particular, ATP-binding cassette A-I, to facilitate delivery of cholesterol within the macrophage cell to the cell surface, where it can be taken up by nascent HDL particles for transport to the liver, and inhibiting the cholesteryl ester transport protein to promote retention of cholesteryl esters within the HDL core for delivery back to the liver. In addition, new insights into the role of prostaglandin D(2) in the niacin flush and discovery of the niacin receptor has led to a search for a more efficacious and "flushless" niacin.

### Can fibrate therapy redefine the management of diabetic retinopathy? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety [^e1bb06d4]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe microvascular diabetes complication and a leading cause of preventable blindness. Fibrates, being lipid-lowering agents, have been found to have promise in modifying DR progression.

Objective

To determine fibrates' effectiveness and safety profile in reducing the incidence, progression, and severity of diabetic retinopathy.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials and observational cohort studies that compared fibrate therapy with no fibrate therapy in patients with diabetes were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest included the incidence of DR, long-term progression, progression to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), and adverse effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools, and results were synthesized narratively due to heterogeneity in the study populations, follow-up durations, and diagnostic methods.

Results

Only 17 articles were eligible for inclusion in this study. Fibrates significantly reduced the incidence of diabetic retinopathy (OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66–0.77), p < 0.001; I² = 26.53%) and slowed long-term progression (OR 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57–0.79), p < 0.001).; I² = 26.39%) compared to placebo. Combining fibrates with statin reduces DR progression by 17% compared to fibrate alone HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80–0.89), p < 0.001; I² = 31.7%. While progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy showed a favorable trend (RR 0.71 (95% CI: 0.15–3.32), p = 0.67, the result was not statistically significant. Analysis of adverse events, including all-cause mortality (OR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.62–1.19), p = 0.36; I² = 0%), revealed no significant safety benefits in comparison between fibrates and placebo.

Conclusion

Fibrates significantly reduce both the incidence and long-term progression of diabetic retinopathy. Safety analyses revealed no significant difference between placebo and fibrates in reducing serious adverse events or all-cause mortality. What is known about this research topic? What this study adds and its future implications.

### Combination statin-fibrate therapy: safety aspects [^88c04c63]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome remain at high residual risk of cardiovascular events even after intensive statin therapy. While treatment guidelines recommend the addition of a fibrate to statin therapy in this setting, concerns about the potential for myopathy may limit the use of this combination in clinical practice. These concerns are certainly justified for gemfibrozil, which interferes with statin glucuronidation, leading to elevation in statin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myotoxicity in combination with a range of commonly prescribed statins. However, the available evidence refutes suggestions that this is a class effect for fibrates. Fenofibrate does not adversely influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of any of the commonly prescribed statins. This in turn translates to a reduced potential for myotoxicity in combination with a statin. Data are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate plus simvastatin combination therapy in type 2 diabetes patients.

Reported adverse events

Niacin is known to cause flushing. This was clearly reported on in four trials. Of these trials, one gave a small dose of niacin to the placebo group, one recommended that participants took aspirin, one gave laropiprant, and one was unblinded. Across these trials, the risk difference in the development of an adverse skin effect was 0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.07, P < 0.001), and heterogeneity between trials was significant (I 2 = 86%).

The HPS2-Thrive study reported multiple new signals for possible harm, including infection, gastrointestinal complications, bleeding, complications of diabetes, and musculoskeletal side effects (see supplementary appendix 7).

Fibrates

Description of included studies

Twenty completed randomised controlled trialsenrolling 46 099 patients, lasting between 12 and 85 months, reported the effects of fibrates on the included outcomes (table 2). One study had to be excluded as it did not report extractable data on our endpoints. In two of the studiessome or all of the patients were receiving statin treatment (100% and 26%, respectively).

HDL = high density lipoprotein; LDL = low density lipoprotein; NR = not reported.

Assessment of quality

Early trialspresented limited data on the key aspects of trial quality, such as randomisation and maintenance of blinding. More recent trialsshowed better evidence of good quality design, with satisfactory central randomisation using block design stratification with clear central event adjudication, and methods in place to ensure maintenance of double blinding. Dropout rates were high in several trialspartly perhaps because of publicity surrounding the published WHO Clofibrate study, which reported an increased mortality for patients receiving fibrates.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^bba6b276]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — combination therapy and other agents: Because fibrates, niacin, n-3 fatty acids, and statins have different mechanisms, there is considerable potential for combinations based on complementary mechanisms, and examples include a combination of niacin and statins or fibrates and statins. Attention needs to be paid to potential drug-drug interaction, and "combination treatment should be initiated carefully, and advice should be sought from clinicians familiar with these types of interactions". Pioglitazone has a mild triglyceride-lowering effect whereas rosiglitazone does not lower triglycerides, with side effects including weight gain and risk of heart failure and macular edema, and some data suggest an association between the use of pioglitazone and an increased risk of bladder cancer. Orlistat can lower postprandial triglyceride levels, may be helpful in patients with fasting hyperchylomicronemia, has been used with fibrates with additive effects, and side effects include bloating, diarrhea, incontinence, and oily leakage; cases of severe liver injury have been reported to occur rarely with the use of orlistat.

### Which is the best lipid-modifying strategy in metabolic syndrome and diabetes: fibrates, statins or both? [^67945cc7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2004). Low credibility.

Although less clinical intervention studies have been performed with fibrates than with statins, there are evidences indicating that fibrates may reduce risk of cardiovascular events. The potential clinical benefit of the fenofibrate will be specified by the ongoing Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, which rationale, methods and aims have been just published.

Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events. A combination statin/fibrate therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of the seagents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate appear to be safer and better tolerated. We believe that a proper co-administration of statins and fibrates, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy.

### Treating dyslipidemia with statins: the risk-benefit profile [^823a6e25]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD), the result of coronary atherosclerosis, is the largest single killer of Americans. Central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are the deposition and retention of cholesterol in the arterial walls. Lipid modification, therefore, is key to CHD prevention.

Methods

Data from trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of several pharmacologic agents for dyslipidemia were thoroughly reviewed.

Results

Agents such as bile acid sequestrants, fibric acids, and nicotinic acid have a role in treating dyslipidemia. However, statins are the safest and most effective of the lipid-modifying drugs, reducing the incidence of CHD by as much as 21% to 43%. Despite the overall safety and efficacy of these agents, many patients undergoing statin therapy fail to achieve the treatment goals specified in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, often because of suboptimal use, tolerability problems, or lack of compliance. Although adverse effects of statins are generally mild and transient, more serious adverse effects, including myotoxicity, liver toxicity, and rhabdomyolysis, are still possible with statin monotherapy and are more common in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system.

Conclusions

Because of the overall safety and efficacy of the statins, more patients with or at risk for CHD should be receiving aggressive therapy to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and reduce CHD risk.

Fibrates, which reduce triglycerides by up to 50%, are considered the most potent triglyceride-lowering agents. Because of increased risk of myopathy, fibrates should be used with caution in combination with certain statins. Although fenofibrate is typically safer with most statins, this agent should also be used cautiously with some statins (e.g. simvastatin). Prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acids, including IPE, other EPA-only formulations, or EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), reduce triglycerides by up to 40%. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, reduces triglycerides by up to 30%. Because it is associated with glucose elevations, it should be used cautiously if at all in people with diabetes or prediabetes. Depending on the severity of triglyceride elevations, more than one of these agents may be needed. Pioglitazone may also be useful in patients with insulin resistance. Those with acute, severe hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia may benefit from insulin infusion.

Hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates with statins: fenofibrate is much less likely than gemfibrozil to induce myopathy when administered with a statin, and for this reason the recommendation in statin labels is to avoid gemfibrozil; in adverse event reporting, 4.5 cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported per million prescriptions for fenofibrate plus a statin versus 87 cases per million prescriptions for gemfibrozil plus a statin.

### Myopathy with statin-fibrate combination therapy: clinical considerations [^21f31f6c]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Many patients who receive statin therapy for hyperlipidemia-such as patients with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome — have residual cardiovascular risk. These patients often have dyslipidemia, including low levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides and small, dense LDL. For such patients, combination treatment with statins and fibrates is a potentially useful strategy to improve lipid and lipoprotein profiles and reduce cardiovascular risk. However, statin-fibrate combination regimens have potential adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myopathy. To date, no large-scale, prospective, randomized, controlled trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of statin-fibrate combination therapy; one such trial is underway but will not report data until 2010. Until then, clinicians need to consider pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, metabolic, pathophysiologic and other factors that can increase the systemic exposure of statins and/or fibrates and hence heighten the risk of toxic effects on muscles, as well as data from clinical trials and recommendations of consensus panels to optimize the safety of such combination regimens. On the basis of currently available data, fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is the fibrate of choice when used in combination with a statin because each is, in theory, associated with a lower risk of myopathy than gemfibrozil.

### Not all fibrates are made equal: learning from biology and clinical trials [^c6c06f8d]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Atherogenic dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders. Statin therapy, the standard treatment for dyslipidemia management, falls short of controlling the residual risk of adverse cardiovascular events, even with good control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Apolipoprotein B (apoB), in addition to non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), is considered a better measure of residual risk and a more comprehensive treatment target in atherogenic dyslipidemia. Fibrates in combination with statins represent a proven therapeutic modality for atherogenic dyslipidemia. Fibrates lower triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), TRL remnants, and small dense LDL particles while increasing HDL-C levels. However, only fenofibrate appears to reduce apoB, whereas gemfibrozil and pemafibrate do not. This leads to a reduction in atherogenic lipids, as measured by a significant decrease in apoB/non-HDL-C levels, and a corresponding reduction in CVD risk. Real-world efficacy studies and CVD outcome trials have shown that fenofibrate may be an option in combination with statins compared to other fibrates and is well tolerated. Additionally, evidence from real-world studies of the fenofibrate-statin combination in patients over a period of up to 20 years has dispelled safety concerns regarding long-term use of fenofibrate.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^7a8bb73a]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical intervention studies

Statin therapy alone, in addition to best standards of care, is unable to completely normalize CV risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Higher doses may partially correct residual dyslipidaemia, but can also increase the risk of side effects, especially myopathy. Addition of ezetimibe or bile acid resins to statin therapy has little effect on triglycerides and HDL-C levels; resins may even raise triglycerides. Evidence is supportive of therapeutic approaches aimed at concomitantly lowering TRL and raising HDL-C to reduce CV risk. Of these options, both niacin and fibrates influence levels of multiple lipids and lipoproteins (Box 2,) and therefore clinically beneficial effects observed cannot be ascribed solely to changes in any single lipoprotein fraction. Pathways implicated in the lipid effects of niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids are summarized in Table 3. –

Table 3
Mechanisms implicated in the lipid-modifying activity of niacin, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids

Box 2
Lipid effects of niacin, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids

Niacin

Niacin at therapeutic doses has a broad spectrum of effects on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, including raising of HDL-C (Box 2). While various pathways are implicated, – its mechanism of action is incompletely elucidated (Table 3). Niacin may also promote beneficial vasoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects independent of its lipid-modifying activity. –

Imaging trials clearly document attenuated progression of atherosclerosis and intima-media thickening by niacin. – The only major outcome study to date, the Coronary Drug Project, showed that niacin (immediate-release 3 g/day) was associated with a 26% reduction in non-fatal MI (P < 0.005) at 6–7 years, and 11% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.0004) at 15 years (∼9 years after the end of treatment). These clinical benefits were similar in patients with or without hyperglycaemia, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. A recent meta-analysis of niacin studies has confirmed these findings.

### Combination therapy for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: rationale, opportunities and challenges [^760e4640]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Decreasing side effects with combination therapy

Drug combination may decrease side effects in two ways. First, drugs may have dose-dependent side effects and their use in combination may allow using lower doses to increase tolerability without compromising efficacy. Second, addition of a drug may be prescribed to mitigate the side effect of the first drug. There are currently two examples of this strategy. FXR agonists, including obeticholic acid, increase LDL cholesterol; combination with a statin may decrease this side effect. This was tested in the randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind CONTROL phase 2 study. After 4 weeks of obeticholic acid, LDL cholesterol increased; addition of atorvastatin subsequently decreased LDL cholesterol below baseline values (NCT02633956). In the second example, ACC inhibition may be associated with hypertriglyceridaemia; combination with fenofibrate may decrease this side effect. In a phase 2 randomised study, fenofibrate was prescribed 2 weeks before the addition of firsocostat in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. Not only did the combination prevent increase in triglycerides, but it also improved hepatic fat and liver biochemistry (NCT02781584).

Addressing loss of effects

A drug with a narrow mechanism of action may lose its effects over time due to adaptive mechanisms. Combinations may reduce the rate of escape to a monotherapy. There is currently no combination trial designed with this rationale.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^50413c14]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

### Cholesterol-lowering drugs get labeling changes… [^7f10aa8f]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved labeling changes for statins to notify consumers about side effects and possible drug interactions related to the popular drugs. Statins are a class of prescription drugs — used together with diet and exercise — to reduce the amount of low-density cholesterol. All of the new labeling changes provide the public with information about the safe and effective use of statins. Side effects Statin labels have been updated to outline the potential for non-serious and reversible side effects, which include:

- Memory loss and confusion
- Increased blood sugar
- Increased hemoglobin A1c levels Drug interactions There's an increased risk of muscle injury when statins are used with:

- Cholesterol-lowering drugs known as fibrates
- Large doses of niacin
- Ranexa, a medication used to treat angina
- Colchicine, a medication primarily used to treat gout The Lovastatin label has been extensively updated with drugs that should not be used with the medication, and dose limitations. Monitoring of liver enzymes FDA has determined that serious liver injury with statins is a rare adverse event and that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not useful. Labels have been revised to remove the need for routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes. Additional patient information In addition to the labeling changes, patients that use statins should be aware that:

- There have been rare reports of serious liver problems. Patients should notify their healthcare professional right away if they have the following symptoms: feeling unusually tired or weak; loss of appetite; upper belly pain; dark colored urine; yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes.
- Memory loss and confusion have been reported. The conditions are generally non-serious and reversible after stopping statin use.
- Increases in blood sugar levels have been reported.
- Before starting a statin, patients should inform their healthcare professional about all medicines that they are taking or plan to take. Some medicines may interact with statins, increasing the risk for side effects. Patients should contact their healthcare professional if they have any questions or concerns about statins. In addition, they should report side effects from the use of statins to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact Us" box at the bottom of the page. Healthcare professionals should refer to the drug labels for the latest recommendations on prescribing statins.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^14521100]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fibrate–statin muscle toxicity risk — epidemiology and comparative data indicates that monotherapy with a fibrate is associated with a 5.5-fold increased risk of muscle-related toxicity compared with statin therapy alone, and muscle-related toxicity when combined with statins occurs more frequently with gemfibrozil. In large gemfibrozil monotherapy trials VA-HIT and HHS (n = 2531 and n = 4081), there were no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data show reports of muscle symptoms were 15.7 per 1 million prescriptions for gemfibrozil versus 8.8 per 1 million for fenofibrate (odds ratio, 1.78; P < 0.0001), with gemfibrozil-associated rhabdomyolysis ≈10-fold higher compared with fenofibrate. The difference appeared largely driven by patients taking gemfibrozil with a statin, and the increase in risk with coadministration of fibrates and statins is greater than the predicted sum of monotherapy risks, suggesting both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic causal mechanisms.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^92f32160]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recently published systematic review sought to analyze the safety of fibrates in PBC and PSC. Investigators identified 37 studies (31 for PBC and 6 for PSC) that included 1,107 patients treated with fibrates (most of whom were administered bezafibrate or fenofibrate), with or without UDCA. The authors concluded that fibrates are relatively safe for use in PBC, with the most commonly reported adverse events being gastrointestinal (3.9%) and musculoskeletal (4.1%). Eight studies compared UDCA plus fibrates (n = 449) vs UDCA monotherapy (n = 1,074). In those studies, elevated aminotransferases and serum creatinine were reported more commonly in the patients treated with UDCA plus fibrates (2.6% each) vs those treated with UDCA monotherapy (0%–0.6%).

Fibrates were previously not recommended for the treatment of PBC. Since the last publication, additional data on bezafibrate have been published, and the 2021 AASLD practice guidance update stated that fibrates may be considered off-label alternatives for patients with PBC and an inadequate response to UDCA but are discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Bezafibrate is currently not available in the United States; therefore, fenofibrate would be the fibrate option for off-label use in the United States.

Up-to-date PBC algorithm

Considering the new data described above and the updated recommendations, and to further refine the appropriate use of UDCA and OCA in clinical gastroenterology practice, we propose a practical, up-to-date algorithm for first-line and second-line treatments of PBC, as depicted in Figure 3. The key (new) features of the patient algorithm include new guidance-informed suggestions for staging PBC using NIT, earlier assessment of lower thresholds to gauge UDCA response after initiation of therapy, possible earlier initiation of second-line therapy with OCA at lower levels of ALP or bilirubin, avoidance of OCA in patients with cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension or liver decompensation, and the safety and durability of response with long-term OCA therapy and off-label use of fibrates.

### Which is the best lipid-modifying strategy in metabolic syndrome and diabetes: fibrates, statins or both? [^4ee7b1a5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence also suggests that there is a 'fibrate effect' that mediates the reduction in CHD risk beyond the favorable impact of these agents on HDL-cholesterol levels. This last notion is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of fibrates which are known to be related to their mechanisms of action. Being PPAR alpha ligands, fibrates have a significant impact on the synthesis of several apolipoproteins (apo) and enzymes of lipoprotein metabolism as well as on the expression of several genes involved in fibrinolysis and inflammation. Such changes contribute to improve the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to a substantial increase in HDL-cholesterol levels accompanied by a shift in the size and density of LDL particles (from small, dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant cholesteryl ester-rich LDL).

Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome, compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events.

A combination statin/fibrate therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-C levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of the seagents. However, other fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate appear to be safer and better tolerated. We believe that a proper co-administration of statins and fibrates, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of pemafibrate administration in patients with dyslipidemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa0a4467]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have demonstrated that lipid control is important for preventing cardiovascular disease onset. In particular, the finding that cardiovascular disease onset can be prevented by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels via statin administration has achieved high clinical priority. However, the problem here is that the benefit of statin administration to cardiovascular disease inhibition is only approximately 20%, the remaining 80% being residual risk. Target lipids for arteriosclerosis prevention, including triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) except LDL-C, and hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C-emia are reportedly associated with cardiovascular disease onset. As a drug against hyperTG-emia and low HDL-C-emia, a fibrate-system drug capable of strong TG-lowering and HDL-C-elevating actions is being clinically used to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Some meta-analyses have reported the possibility of the suppression of cardiovascular disease development by fibrate administration; this may be useful in remedying the residual risk of arteriosclerosis that cannot be sufficiently controlled by statin administration alone. However, manifestation of side effects, such as hepatic disorder, kidney disorder, or rhabdomyolysis, may be problematic for fibrate-type drugs and may occasionally make it difficult to continue administration. Thus, fibrate formulations are presently considered problematic for wide-scale clinical use.

Pemafibrate reportedly reduces TG, which is considered as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, or increases HDL-C levels. Furthermore, pemafibrate is a PPARα modulator (SPPARMα) with extremely high selectivity to PPARs subtypes, developed with the aim to reduce the occurrence of adverse effects associated with fibrate-type drugs and as a drug with fewer restrictions for use in patients with renal disease or for concomitant statin use. Pemafibrate possesses lipid-improving effects similar to those of existing fibrate-type drugs; moreover, its side effects are equivalent to those of the placebo. We considered that highly relevant results related to the efficacy and safety of pemafibrate administration could be obtained via an integrated analysis of all these previous studies. Therefore, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), this study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of pemafibrate administration in patients with dyslipidemia.

Statin–fenofibrate/fenofibric acid combination therapy — Patients either treated with a statin or qualifying for statin therapy with fasting triglycerides (TG) ≥ 500 mg/dL, after secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia are ruled out and lifestyle modifications implemented, may proceed when baseline CK is within normal limits or < 3 x ULN and estimated CrCL > 30 mL/min and the patient is not frail or elderly; in this setting, use of fenofibrate/fenofibric acid and statin in combination is acceptable. If CK is > 3 x ULN but < 10 x ULN at baseline and the patient has no symptoms of muscle-related adverse effects, fenofibrate/fenofibric acid is acceptable to initiate with close monitoring. Avoid use of fenofibrate/fenofibric acid if CrCL < 30 mL/min, and consider alternative TG-lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or niacin.

There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of fibrates for patients with FCS, and studies in FCS showed reductions in triglyceride levels only when used in combination with other interventions, such as fat restricted diet and MCT oil. Fibrates could be helpful in certain patients with FCS who have secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia that raise VLDL, including obesity. Concerns with fibrates include the potential for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (especially when given with statins), elevations in liver enzymes, and reversible increases in serum creatinine.

Non-statin based lipid-lowering therapy

If LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin dosage, addition of an alternative LDL-C lowering agent should be considered in patients at high CVD risk to improve LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe reduces LDL-C by 15–20%, is easy to take with few side effects, and has been shown to reduce CVD events. In patients with SAMS, the combination of ezetimibe plus fluvastatin XL reduced LDL-C by 46% and was as well tolerated as ezetimibe alone. Bile acid sequestrants can reduce LDL-C levels by 15–25% depending on the type and dose used, and may also improve glycaemia in patients with diabetes. Colesevelam is easier to take and better tolerated than earlier formulations. The combination of a bile acid sequestrant and ezetimibe can reduce LDL-C by ∼30–35%.

Fenofibrate can lower LDL-C by 15–20% in patients with high baseline levels who do not have concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. This fibrate is easy to take, and has shown an excellent safety record in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trials, although additional CVD benefit has not been demonstrated, and serum creatinine was reversibly increased during treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, there is no increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when fenofibrate is added to a statin. Niacin also lowers LDL-C levels by 15–20%, but recent large randomized trials showed a significant excess of adverse effects and no significant CVD benefit when added to background statin treatment; therefore, niacin derivatives are no longer available for prescription in Europe.

Physicians and health care professionals should therefore consider the use of ezetimibe as first choice, potentially followed by bile acid sequestrants or fibrates in combination with ezetimibe, as needed to achieve LDL-C lowering consistent with guidelines.

### Selenoproteins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and the consequences: revisiting of the mevalonate pathway [^b1c9a622]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activators (fibrates) are the backbone of pharmacologic hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia treatment. Many of their clinical effects, however, are still enigmatic. This article describes how a side road of the mevalonate pathway, characterized in recent years, can rationalize a major fraction of these unexplained observations. This side road is the enzymatic isopentenylation of selenocysteine-tRNA([Ser]Sec) (Sec-tRNA), the singular tRNA to decode the unusual amino acid selenocysteine. The functionally indispensable isopentenylation of Sec-tRNA requires a unique intermediate from the mevalonate pathway, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which concomitantly constitutes the central building block for cholesterol biosynthesis, and whose formation is suppressed by statins and fibrates. The resultant inhibition of Sec-tRNA isopentenylation profoundly decreases selenoprotein expression. This effect might seamlessly explain the immunosuppressive, redox, endothelial, sympatholytic, and thyroidal effects of statins and fibrates as well as their common side effects and drug interactions.

### Benefits and drawbacks of statins and non-statin lipid lowering agents in carotid artery disease [^be3bcc03]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

International guidelines strongly recommend statins alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels for patients with asymptomatic/symptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS/SCS). Lowering LDL-C levels is associated with significant reductions in transient ischemic attack, stroke, cardiovascular (CV) event and death rates. The aim of this multi-disciplinary overview is to summarize the benefits and risks associated with lowering LDL-C with statins or non-statin medications for Asx/SCS patients. The cerebrovascular and CV beneficial effects associated with statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and other non-statin lipid-lowering agents (e.g. fibrates, ezetimibe) are reviewed. The use of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors is associated with several beneficial effects for Asx/SCS patients, including carotid plaque stabilization and reduction of stroke rates. Ezetimibe and fibrates are associated with smaller reductions in stroke rates. The side-effects resulting from statin and PCSK9 inhibitor use are also highlighted. The benefits associated with lowering LDL-C with statins or non-statin lipid lowering agents (e.g. PCSK9 inhibitors) outweigh the risks and potential side-effects. Irrespective of their LDL-C levels, all Asx/SCS patients should receive high-dose statin treatment ± ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors for reduction not only of LDL-C levels, but also of stroke, cardiovascular mortality and coronary event rates.

### Risk of adverse events with fibrates [^d9bdd9fc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

### Reporting rate of rhabdomyolysis with fenofibrate + statin versus gemfibrozil + any statin [^2fb29cd1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There is an increasing trend among physicians to use 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in combination with other antilipidemic agents. The complementary lipid-altering effects of statins and fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) have led to an increasing use of statin/fibrate combination therapy, particularly for patients who have mixed dyslipidemia. Clinical experience indicates that there may be an increased risk of myotoxicity associated with statin/fibrate combination therapy. However, it is not known whether there are differences in the rate of myotoxicity between the use of fenofibrate and gemfibrozil in combination with statins. To evaluate this question, data from the United States Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System was reviewed to determine how many adverse events were reported for patients who were being treated concomitantly with statins and fibrates. The findings suggest that the use of fenofibrate in combination with statins results in fewer reports of rhabdomyolysis per million prescriptions dispensed than does the use of gemfibrozil.

Fenofibrate (or fenofibric acid) is the preferred fibrate to use in combination with statins.

### Fibrates are an essential part of modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal: spotlight on atherogenic dyslipidemia and residual risk reduction [^de408b3b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Even intensive statin therapy does not eliminate the residual cardiovascular risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low HDL and high triglycerides). Meta-analyses of randomized control trials clearly demonstrated that the main fibrates significantly reduce this risk. Combined fibrate/statin therapy is more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control and may lead to additional cardiovascular risk reduction, as could be suggested for fenofibrate following ACCORD Lipid study subgroup analysis and for bezafibrate on the bais on one small randomized study and multiple observational data. Therefore, in appropriate patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia fibrates- either as monotherapy or combined with statins – are consistently associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events. Fibrates currently are an indispensable part of the modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal for patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^a39ac2f6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the USA. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

### The role of fibrates in the prevention of cardiovascular disease – a pooled meta-analysis of long-term randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^de5d7006]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrates are effective antilipidemic agents with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist activity, but clinical trial data on their role in cardiovascular prevention are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to evaluate their role in prevention of cardiovascular events.

Methods

A total of 36,489 patients from 10 published randomized placebo-controlled trials were analyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model. Odds ratios were computed for cardiovascular outcomes from data pooled from the selected trials, and statistical significance was tested using the z-test statistic (2-sided alpha error < .05).

Results

Fibrates significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels by about 8% and 30%, respectively, and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by about 9% compared with placebo. The odds of all-cause mortality tended to be higher (P = 0.08), and the odds of noncardiovascular mortality were significantly higher (P = 0.004) with the use of fibrates. However, these significant differences did not persist after exclusion of trials using clofibrate as the study drug. Fibrates did not significantly reduce the odds of cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.68), fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (P = 0.76), or stroke (P = 0.56). On the other hand, fibrates significantly reduced the odds of nonfatal MI by about 22% (P < .00001). The odds of developing cancer were not significantly higher with the use of fibrates (P = 0.98), nor were the odds of cancer-related death (P = 0.17).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our meta-analysis revealed that the long-term use of fibrates significantly reduces the occurrence of nonfatal MI but has no significant effect on other adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to fibrates, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding fenofibrate or bezafibrate to statins for primary prevention in patients with triglyceride levels of > 2.3 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) achieved LDL-C goal.

### Management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease: a role for combination fibrate therapy [^b864eca0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary focus of the management of dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. However, use of a statin alone may be insufficient for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides, with or without elevated levels of LDL-C.

Objective

This report reviews the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of different combination treatments for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, as supported by clinical-trial data and recommended by national guidelines.

Methods

Using the terms lipid-modifying therapy, combination therapy, combination statin-fibrate therapy, and mixed dyslipidemia, a search of PubMed was conducted (completed in April 2007, updated to October 2007) to identify English-language publications and pertinent studies of fibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, including those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

Results

National guidelines recommend the addition of either niacin (nicotinic acid) or a fibrate to statin therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia to achieve better overall lipid control. Fibrates do not have detrimental effects on uric acid levels or glycemic control in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System indicating that gemfibrozil plus a statin was associated with a 15-fold higher risk of rhabdomyolysis than fenofibrate plus a statin, fenofibrate may be the fi-brate of choice for use in combination with a statin. As reported by the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study, fenofibrate treatment has also been associated with microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is consistent with preliminary evidence from the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study.

Conclusion

The addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy may be a useful strategy for the management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Fibrate-induced increase in blood urea and creatinine: is gemfibrozil the only innocuous agent? [^a461757a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Some reports indicate that fibrates can induce renal dysfunction. However, the clinical characteristics of these episodes, and the respective nephrotoxicity of the four main fibrates used-namely, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and gemfibrozil-remain ill defined.

Methods

To better characterize this side-effect, we first reviewed the charts of 27 patients from our institution who developed an impairment of renal function during fibrate therapy. We next analysed the articles (n = 24) that contained data on renal function in patients taking fibrates (n = 2676).

Results

Among our 27 patients, 25 were on fenofibrate therapy, one was taking bezafibrate, and one ciprofibrate. Nineteen were recipients of solid-organ transplants (kidney recipients, n = 15; heart or heart-lung recipients, n = 4), and eight were non-transplanted patients with some impairment of renal function. Baseline plasma creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 2.9 mg/dl. It increased by a mean of 40% after the start of fibrate therapy. There was a concomitant increase of blood urea values (mean 36%) in most of the patients. Renal function returned to baseline in 18/24 patients after fibrate discontinuation. However, six patients, all transplant recipients, experienced a permanent increase in plasma creatinine. The incidence of fibrate-induced renal dysfunction among our series of kidney transplant recipients was 60%, as it occurred in 15 of the 25 patients who had ever taken fibrates. An increase of mean creatinine values during therapy was described in all papers on fenofibrate (n = 7) and bezafibrate (n = 8) (range 8–18% and 8–40% respectively), and in three of four papers dealing with ciprofibrate (range 6–16%). No significant renal impairment was described in any of the eight articles reporting data on gemfibrozil therapy.

Conclusion

Therapy with fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate may induce renal dysfunction. Gemfibrozil appears to be devoid of this side-effect.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a "suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate in patients with dyslipidemia: a pooled analysis of two open-label trials [^0bb41757]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Newer fibrates such as micronized fenofibrate lower triglyceride (TG) levels, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and lower fibrinogen levels, in addition to markedly lowering levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A new microcoated "suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate has demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared with micronized fenofibrate 200 mg/d and may effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors at the lower dose of 160 mg/d.

Objective

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate in patients with type IIa, type IIb, or type IV dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a pooled analysis of data from 2 unpublished multicenter, open-label trials with a common protocol. After a 4-week washout period, patients with dyslipidemias not corrected by diet alone were assigned to receive microcoated fenofibrate 160 mg/d for 12 weeks. Changes in lipid profiles and safety variables (vital signs, body weight, and laboratory measures) were monitored throughout the study, and adverse events occurring between visits 1 and 5 were recorded by the study investigators.

Results

The 2 trials included 375 men and women (mean age, 55.2 years) with type IIa (n = 158), type IIb (n = 195), type IV (n = 21), or other (n = 1) dyslipidemias. At end point. HDL-C levels in patients with type IIa, IIb, or IV dyslipidemia were increased by a respective 10.9% (P < 0.001), 16.1% (P < 0.001), and 12.1% (P < 0.05), whereas TG levels were decreased by a respective 27.7% (P < 0.001), 46.4% (P < 0.001), and 40.2% (P < 0.05). In patients with type IIa or IIb dyslipidemia, TC decreased (-14.3% in each group), LDL-C decreased (-20.6% and -13.2%, respectively), and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio decreased (-26.7% and -22.0%) (all, P < 0.001). Overall, 121 of 375 (32.3%) patients experienced ≥ adverse event (AE) (202 nonserious, 8 serious). Of these, 10.1% were judged to be possibly drug related. The most common nonserious AEs were those affecting the body as a whole (2.7% of patients) and the digestive system (5.3% of patients). No serious AE was considered drug related.

Conclusions

The new "suprabioavailable" microcoated, micronized formulation of fenofibrate appears to maintain the good efficacy and safety profile of micronized fenofibrate. In the study population with moderate dyslipidemia (types IIa and IIb), it promoted beneficial changes in major lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

### Fibrates are an essential part of modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal: spotlight on atherogenic dyslipidemia and residual risk reduction [^91ccc71f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Currently the world faces epidemic of several closely related conditions: obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The lipid profile of these patients and those with metabolic syndrome is characterized by the concurrent presence of qualitative as well as quantitative lipoprotein abnormalities: low levels of HDL, increased triglycerides, and prevalence of LDL particles that are smaller and denser than normal. This lipid phenotype has been defined as atherogenic dyslipidemia. Overwhelming evidences demonstrate that all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemia are important risk-factors for cardiovascular diseases. Optimal reduction of cardiovascular risk through comprehensive management of atherogenic dyslipidemias basically depends of the presence of efficacious lipid-modulating agents (beyond statin-based reduction of LDL-C). The most important class of medications which can be effectively used nowadays to combat atherogenic dyslipidemias is the fibrates. From a clinical point of view, in all available 5 randomized control trials beneficial effects of major fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate) were clearly demonstrated and were highly significant in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. In these circumstances, the main determinant of the overall results of the trial is mainly dependent of the number of the included appropriate patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. In a meta-analysis of dyslipidemic subgroups totaling 4726 patients a significant 35% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events was observed compared with a non significant 6% reduction in those without dyslipidemia. However, different fibrates may have a somewhat different spectrum of effects. Currently only fenofibrate was investigated and proved to be effective in reducing microvascular complications of diabetes. Bezafibrate reduced the severity of intermittent claudication. Cardinal differences between bezafibrate and other fibrates are related to the effects on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Bezafibrate is the only clinically available pan - (alpha, beta, gamma) PPAR balanced activator. Bezafibrate decreases blood glucose level, HbA1C, insulin resistance and reduces the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo or other fibrates. Among major fibrates, bezafibrate appears to have the strongest and fenofibrate the weakest effect on HDL-C. Current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events because even intensive statin therapy does not eliminate the residual cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL and/or high triglycerides. As compared with statin monotherapy (effective mainly on LDL-C levels and plaque stabilization), the association of a statin with a fibrate will also have a major impact on triglycerides, HDL and LDL particle size. Moreover, in the specific case of bezafibrate one could expect neutralizing of the adverse pro-diabetic effect of statins. Though muscle pain and myositis is an issue in statin/fibrate treatment, adverse interaction appears to occur to a significantly greater extent when gemfibrozil is administered. However, bezafibrate and fenofibrate seems to be safer and better tolerated. Combined fibrate/statin therapy is more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control and may lead to additional cardiovascular risk reduction, as could be suggested for fenofibrate following ACCORD Lipid study subgroup analysis and for bezafibrate on the basis of one small randomized study and multiple observational data. Therefore, in appropriate patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia fibrates- either as monotherapy or combined with statins - are consistently associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events. Fibrates currently constitute an indispensable part of the modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal for patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.

### Paradoxical decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with fenofibrate: a quite common phenomenon [^a7c53240]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is considered to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fibrates are useful in managing dyslipidaemia; reports highlight an expected increase in HDL-C of 10–15% in conjunction with falls in plasma triglycerides of approximately 30%. Despite this, there are several reported cases of paradoxical decreases in HDL-C caused by fibrate treatment.

Aim

To report the second largest observational study to date.

Methods

Fenofibrate use at a regional lipid clinic was associated with reductions in HDL-C in a considerable proportion of patients, necessitating cessation of the medication. In view of this, characteristics of the first 94 patients to be given fenofibrate were retrospectively analysed, and comparisons were made between those whose profiles responded as expected and those experiencing paradoxical decreases in HDL-C.

Results

94 patients (57 male; mean (SD) age 52.5 (12.5) years; mean (SD) body mass index 28.9 (4.5) kg/m2) were assessed. After 8–12 weeks on daily fenofibrate (200 mg micronised or equivalent), 43 of the patients (46%) showed a paradoxical decrease in HDL-C (in nine the decrease was > 50% from baseline). When responses to fenofibrate were compared against baseline variables, there were no significant differences between groups other than a higher baseline HDL-C (p = 0.045) in patients responding appropriately.

Conclusions

Fenofibrate was associated with a reduction in HDL-C in almost half the patients studied. This is substantially more than in most studies reported to date. Other HDL-C-raising strategies need to be considered in these patients, and the mechanisms need to be explored.

### Fenofibrate (Tricor) [^9fb5eabf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of fenofibrate PO (also known as Tricor):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis due to potential failure of efficacy in severe hypertriglyceridemia, medication side effects, or biliary tract stone or sludge formation leading to bile duct obstruction.
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants. Monitor PT/INR and adjust anticoagulant dose as necessary.
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the effect of fenofibrate on coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality, as well as non-cardiovascular mortality, has not been established.
- **Cholelithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate increases cholesterol excretion and reduces bile acid excretion into bile, increasing the risk of cholelithiasis.
- **Decreased serum HDL**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with a paradoxica reduction in serum HDL levels. Monitor HDL levels within the first few months of treatment.
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with an increased risk of serious drug-induced liver injury, including liver transplantation and death.
- **Hematologic abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with mild-to-moderate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Monitor RBC and WBC counts during the first 12 month of treatment.
- **Increased serum creatinine**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with elevated serum creatinine. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, and elderly patients.
- **Myopathy, rhabdomyolysis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fibrates are associated with an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, especially in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism.
- **VTE**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fenofibrate has been associated with an increased risk of PE and DVT.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ezetimibe tablets is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe tablets initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ezetimibe tablets administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^85248730]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibrate drugs — gemfibrozil has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as monotherapy in primary prevention high risk males with elevated non-HDL-C and for secondary prevention in males with below average HDL-C; the class can reduce TG and non-HDL-C in mixed dyslipidemia and is considered a first-line choice for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL). In the ACCORD Lipid trial of fenofibrate added to a statin, no benefit was demonstrated in the full study sample compared to statin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes, but a predefined subgroup with TG in the top tertile (≥ 204 mg/dL) and HDL-C in the bottom tertile (≤ 34 mg/dL) had a significantly lower ASCVD event rate with fenofibrate compared to placebo (−29%). Gemfibrozil should not be used with statins because of a drug–drug interaction that increases the risk for myositis; fenofibrate and fenofibric acid have not been found to have this adverse event when combined with statins. Fenofibrate has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and has not been associated with incident diabetes. Fibrates should not be used in patients with stage 3B CKD or worse, and based on limited outcomes data, consideration of fenofibrate or fenofibric acid as statin combination therapy is in type 2 diabetes patients with a non-HDL-C at goal who also have retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria and who do not have stage 3B or worse CKD.

Fibrates — Lipid effects vary by phenotype: in isolated hypercholesterolemia LDL-C may be reduced by up to 20%; in mixed dyslipidemia LDL-C is reduced modestly (5–15%) with larger TG reductions (25–35%); in severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 300 mg/dL) TG may be reduced by 45–55% while LDL-C may rise. Gemfibrozil monotherapy trials showed benefits versus placebo, whereas fenofibrate trials in type 2 diabetes found no significant overall benefit for composite major coronary or cardiovascular endpoints; meta-analyses of subgroups suggested potential benefit in elevated TG, particularly with reduced HDL-C.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^53eaf108]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and recommendations for statin–fibrate drug–drug interactions — On pharmacokinetic evidence, the combination of gemfibrozil with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin is potentially harmful and should be avoided; although gemfibrozil interacts with atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin, the result is only a minor increase in statin concentrations, and the combination may be considered if clinically indicated. Fluvastatin may be used in combination with gemfibrozil without any specific dose limitations and does not interact with gemfibrozil, and combination therapy with fenofibrate/fenofibric acid and any statin is reasonable when clinically indicated. When statin-fibrate combination therapy is indicated, fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is preferred, and under any circumstance, the use of gemfibrozil should be avoided in combination with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin.

### Effect on cardiovascular risk of high density lipoprotein targeted drug treatments niacin, fibrates, and CETP inhibitors: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including 117, 411 patients [^b504d355]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Results

The literature searches identified 387 publications of niacin, 749 of fibrates, and 263 of CETP inhibitors that potentially met our criteria. Of these there were 11 eligible trials of niacin, 20 of fibrates, and eight of CETP inhibitors. Two trials were of niacin and fibrate in combination compared with control (see supplementary appendix 2).

In one trialniacin was part of combination treatment with colestipol, with the control arm receiving neither. In two trialsniacin and a fibrate were part of a combination treatment, with the control arms receiving neither. We included these two trials in both the niacin and fibrate analyses, and we performed a sensitivity analysis with them excluded (see supplementary appendix 5).

Niacin

Description of included studies

Eleven completed randomised controlled trialsenrolling 35 301 patients, lasting between six and 60 months, reported the effects of niacin on the included outcomes (table 1). Of these, 30 310 patientswere in trials with statin used by some or all the patients, and 4991 patients were in trials with no statin treatment. The most recent trial, HPS2-Thrive, has announced its outcome data, which we have included in this meta-analysis.

Table 1
Description of included studies of niacin

HDL = high density lipoprotein; LDL = low density lipoprotein; NR = not reported.

Assessment of quality

Concealing allocation with niacin is challenging because of the high risk of flushing. In one attempt to ameliorate this unavoidable unblinding, participants were given a small dose of niacin in the placeboon the assumption that this would be enough to cause flushing but not enough to prevent events. Another approach has been to add agents to inhibit the flushing effect, such as aspirinor laropiprant. Laropiprant is thought to work by modifying prostaglandin pathways. It is possible, however, that its effect could confound the effect of niacin. One study did not make a special attempt to obscure this effect and might therefore be argued to be unblinded. A higher cessation of treatment was seen in the niacin compared with the placebo group in most of the studies, predominantly as a result of the unpleasant side effect of facial flushing.

The assessment of risk of bias can be found in supplementary appendix 3a.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^13966546]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fenofibrate with statins — safety signals and conditional use — Data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System indicate rhabdomyolysis reports per 1 million prescriptions were ≈15 times lower with fenofibrate than with gemfibrozil when prescribed with statins other than cerivastatin (0.58 per 1 million versus 8.6 per 1 million), and in the FIELD study (n = 9795) none of the ≈1000 on statin–fenofibrate experienced rhabdomyolysis; ACCORD found no statistically significant differences in myositis, rhabdomyolysis, or hepatic transaminase elevations with simvastatin–fenofibrate versus simvastatin alone. The guideline panel recommended that "Fenofibrate may be considered concomitantly with a low- or moderate-intensity statin only if the benefits from ASCVD risk reduction or triglyceride lowering when triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL are judged to outweigh the potential risk for adverse effects".

Severe primary hypertriglyceridemias — children with severe hypertriglyceridemia for whom diet and exercise are insufficient can consider nutriceuticals and medications, with adult data showing omega-3 fish oil capsules reducing TG by 30–45 percent and pediatric safety noted in limited contexts; fibrates lower TG and increase HDL–C in a small pediatric series, while niacin has limited pediatric experience with a single series demonstrating a high rate of side effects, and the use of either fibrates or niacin in youths should be undertaken only with the assistance of a lipid specialist. Children with sustained TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL present a rare, serious problem usually linked to LPL deficiency, HL deficiency, or apoC–II deficiency, are at high risk for pancreatitis beginning in infancy, and management of these patients should always be in consultation with a lipid specialist; these children require a very low-fat diet (< 10 percent fat) with a nutritionist, medium-chain TG can significantly lower TG when substituted for usual fats, patients with either LPL or apoC–II deficiency do not respond to lipid-altering medications, and patients with HL deficiency will respond to fibrates, niacin, or statins.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^9076aa1d]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.3	Liver Function

Fenofibrate (administered over a range of doses with the higher dose equivalent to 105 mg fenofibric acid) has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)].

In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal of ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo.

When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related. In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg to 105 mg FIBRICOR per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg or less FIBRICOR per day, or placebo.

Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with chronic active hepatitis.

Baseline and regular, periodic monitoring of liver function, including ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with FIBRICOR, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.

5.4	Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, such as the elderly and patients with diabetes.

5.5	Cholelithiasis

FIBRICOR, like fenofibrate, clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. FIBRICOR therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.

### Statin-fibrate combination therapy [^41024d22]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed.

Objective

To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia.

Data Sources

A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.

### PES lipid SIG diabetes and lipids algorithm [^3628c582]. PES (2024). High credibility.

PES Lipid SIG — triglyceride management (off label in pediatrics) notes omega-3 fatty acids with a recommended dose of 4g/day DHA/EPA and provides a fibrate pathway: counsel about side effects, potential interactions, and contraindications; prefer fenofibrate initially; and check baseline AST and ALT and again in 4 weeks to monitor therapy. If AST or ALT exceeds toxicity thresholds (> 3x ULN), stop the fibrate and consider restarting at a lower dose once labs normalize or refer to a lipid specialist. Additional cautions include that TG-lowering medications in adults with diabetes have shown inconsistent results with improved CVD benefit, an elevated muscle toxicity risk when combined with a statin, specific drug interactions, and contraindications including severe renal dysfunction and acute liver disease.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^6a88881a]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.2	Skeletal Muscle

Fibrates increase the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism.

Data from observational studies suggest that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, in particular gemfibrozil, are co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). The combination should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and FIBRICOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy/myositis is suspected or diagnosed.

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Phenotype standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [^2482e396]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Risk Factors

Concomitant medications

Fibrates. A significant body of evidence suggests an increased risk of statin myopathy, particularly rhabdomyolysis, in patients taking statins in combination with fibrates. Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System between 1998 and 2002 was used to determine reporting rates for rhabdomyolysis in patients taking fenofibrate and gemfibrozil in combination with statins. Gemfibrozil, a fibric acid derivative, increases systemic exposure to active simvastatin acid by inhibiting both glucuronidation and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 transporter–mediated uptake into the liver.

Overall rates of rhabdomyolysis for any statin medication users coprescribed fenofibrate or gemfibrozil were 4.5 and 8.7 per million prescriptions, respectively. When stratified to those patients receiving cerivastatin only, the rates increased to 140 and 4,600 per million prescriptions with fenofibrate/cerivastatin and gemfibrozil/cerivastatin combination therapy, respectively. Although the effect of fibrate coadministration on statin bioavailability exists for the majority of statins, the increase in myopathy risk is especially pronounced with cerivastatin. Although cerivastatin was withdrawn in 2001, the identification of predisposing pharmacogenomics factors may still be of use for elucidating predisposing factors of muscle toxicity with the statins more commonly used nowadays.

CYP3A4 inhibition. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals, protease inhibitors, amiodarone, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers, and macrolide antibiotics, to name a few, increase risk of myopathy for statins that undergo CYP3A4 metabolism (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin). In addition, some foods such as grapefruit juice, which contains furanocoumarins, irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4 in the gut. The effect is reduced gut wall metabolism of statins (particularly simvastatin) and increased systemic exposure, which can lead to adverse effects.

Comorbidities

A list of comorbidities that are associated with an increased risk of developing statin-related myotoxicity is shown in Table 2. They include hypothyroidism, chronic renal insufficiency, infection, impaired liver function, hypertension, physical exertion, and diabetes.

### Statins research unfinished saga: desirability versus feasibility [^b50b1bff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Extensive evidence from intervention trials has been presented to demonstrate that "old" statin treatment results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By contrast, statin treatment has not been associated consistently with reduction in plasma RLP-C levels. In general, however, it can be concluded that RLP-C lowering by statins depends on their ability to reduce triglyceride levels. Therefore, among all currently clinically available statins only atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have potential to reduce RLP-C levels.

In addition, the concomitant use of fibrate and statin seems to be attractive in patients whose LDL-cholesterol is controlled by statin but whose HDL-cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels are still inappropriate. A combination statin/fibrate may be necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates- such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate – appear to be safer and better tolerated.

The combination of fibrate with statin which are not mainly metabolized within the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (like pravastatin or fluvastatin) may be even less hazardous. We believe that a proper coadministration of statins and fibrates in some cases, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy. An alternative sort of future combination may hypothetically be represented by ezetimibe and fibrate. Ezetimibe represents the newest class of lipid-modifying agents. It exerts its cholesterol-lowering effect by inhibiting the absorption of both the dietary cholesterol and biliary cholesterol at the brush border of the small intestine. Because of its distinct mechanism of action, ezetimibe appears to be most useful as part of combination therapy with other lipid-modifying agents rather than as monotherapy. Ezetimibe is approved currently for use alone or with statins, and initial study with fibrates are promising.

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^3863e47a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.

### A review of paradoxical HDL-C responses to fenofibrate, illustrated by a case report [^7be9935a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are widely used in the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia, principally for their triglyceride-lowering and HDL-C-raising effects. Fibrates may cause paradoxical reductions in HDL-C. These reductions are usually modest, but significant reductions have been observed. The molecular mechanism for these paradoxical reductions remains unexplained despite advances in our understanding of lipid metabolism. This review considers possible mechanisms for this effect, illustrated by a patient with an observed reduction in HDL-C of 88% after introduction of fenofibrate.

Hypertriglyceridemia — initial pharmacologic approach and combinations: For patients with persistent elevation in triglycerides up to 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), statins are the first choice of pharmacological therapy as adjunct to lifestyle changes, and a fibrate may also be used with the caution that the combination of a fibrate and a statin increases the risk of myopathy; this risk is more common with gemfibrozil compared with fenofibrate. In addition, EPA ethyl ester is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk in statin-treated patients with TG of 150–499 mg/dL.

Recommendations for the monitoring and safety of lipid-lowering agents

The overall safety of statins has been exhaustively evaluated. In general use, serious side effects are considered uncommon. Regarding the safety of statins in CKD, the 2009 Cochrane meta-analysis recorded no significant increase in the risk of rhabdomyolysis (defined as > 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)), nor in liver function abnormalities (defined as > 3 times the ULN).

Women of childbearing potential should be advised about the teratogenic risks of statins. Women on statins and planning a pregnancy should stop this therapy three months before they attempt to conceive and should not restart until completion of breastfeeding.

The main side effects noted in RCTs for ezetimibe, fibrates, Bempedoic acid, inclisiran, PCKS9i and icosapent ethyl are listed in Table 3. For more extensive recommendations, please refer to the individual summary of product characteristics.

Side effects of lipid-lowering agents

Recommendation for when to stop lipid-lowering agents

CVD is prevalent in older people; however, evidence for risk reduction by lipid management is limited. Subgroup analysis of major statin trials have been performed to determine if there is a differential outcome among different age groups. A CTT analysis of statin therapy at different ages found evidence of benefit in those aged > 75 years. There may, however, be an inherent bias in this meta-analysis and indeed other studies and post-hoc analyses as people with frailty, for example those with dementia or multiple comorbidities, would be unlikely to be recruited to these trials. The older group of participants included may therefore represent the healthier and possibly more engaged cohorts. A case-by-case approach is recommended for cessation of therapy in the elderly.
