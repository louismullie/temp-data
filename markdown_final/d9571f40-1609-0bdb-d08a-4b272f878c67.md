## Question

Pt with headaches after head injury. Does a head mri need contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a head MRI needs contrast for a patient with headaches after a head injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute versus subacute or chronic post-traumatic headache. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines say about MRI contrast in traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic headache. Next, I will examine the diagnostic yield of contrast versus non-contrast MRI in this setting. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where contrast changes management, such as suspected infection, neoplasm, vascular injury, or CSF leak. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, phase-based recommendation and note exceptions and follow-up strategies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because timing and neurologic status drive imaging choices. In the acute phase, non-contrast head CT is the first-line test when imaging is indicated for suspected intracranial hemorrhage or moderate-to-severe injury, whereas MRI is typically reserved for persistent or unexplained deficits after a negative CT or when CT is contraindicated, and in the subacute to chronic phase, non-contrast brain MRI becomes the modality of choice to evaluate persistent symptoms or unexplained deficits after head trauma [^a676a805] [^2907af29] [^90af7c2f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of contrast in traumatic brain injury imaging. The ACR Head Trauma Appropriateness Criteria consistently recommend non-contrast brain MRI when MRI is indicated for TBI, including for subacute or chronic trauma with unexplained cognitive or neurologic deficits, and they explicitly note that MRI is equivalent to non-contrast head CT for initial imaging, so only one modality should be obtained initially, and they do not recommend routine contrast for TBI evaluation [^a676a805] [^922759ca].

> I should confirm whether contrast adds value in routine post-traumatic headache without red flags. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought contrast might help detect subtle parenchymal injury, but the ACR guidance and contemporary practice parameters emphasize that non-contrast MRI sequences, including T1, T2, FLAIR, T2✱ or SWI, and DWI, provide the necessary sensitivity for traumatic parenchymal injury, microhemorrhage, and extra-axial collections, and routine gadolinium does not meaningfully increase detection of actionable pathology in this context [^a676a805] [^7b4ed228].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic yield of contrast-enhanced MRI in headache populations more broadly to ensure I'm not missing a hidden benefit. A recent outpatient study of 874 contrast-enhanced MRIs for headache found that only 2% of cases were deemed contrast-relevant, and blinded review showed essentially no change in detection of actionable intracranial pathology when contrast was added, supporting a non-contrast-first strategy with selective contrast only when indicated [^9b7545b5].

> But wait, what if there are specific red flags that would change management with contrast. I need to check for scenarios where contrast meaningfully alters diagnosis or treatment: suspected intracranial infection, leptomeningeal disease, post-traumatic CSF leak with meningeal enhancement, vascular inflammation or dissection, or suspected neoplasm, in which case contrast-enhanced MRI or targeted vascular imaging may be appropriate; for example, spontaneous intracranial hypotension workups and selected vascular injuries benefit from contrast-enhanced MRI or MRV/CTV, and carotid dissection after minor trauma may be revealed with contrast-enhanced vascular imaging when suspected clinically [^b74332fd] [^6b3dbe10] [^84ebe7fb].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations because families often ask about radiation and contrast. Pediatric policies align with adult guidance: MRI is preferred over CT when available and stable, and non-contrast MRI is generally sufficient; emergent neuroimaging is reserved for children with neurologic signs, seizures, or changing headache patterns, and routine contrast is not indicated for uncomplicated post-traumatic headache in children [^fd1bb804] [^a5fd76d9].

> Let me synthesize a practical, phase-based answer. In the acute phase, if imaging is indicated for suspected hemorrhage or moderate-to-severe injury, obtain a non-contrast head CT first. If CT is negative but neurologic deficits persist or suspicion remains high, consider non-contrast brain MRI with appropriate trauma sequences rather than adding contrast up front [^a676a805] [^2907af29]. In the subacute to chronic phase, if headaches persist or new neurologic symptoms emerge, obtain non-contrast brain MRI as the initial study, reserving contrast for suspected infection, leptomeningeal disease, vascular injury, CSF leak, or neoplasm based on clinical features and evolution [^a676a805] [^7b4ed228].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions and follow-up. If the non-contrast MRI reveals an abnormality that requires better delineation of enhancement patterns, leptomeningeal involvement, or vascular anatomy, then add gadolinium-enhanced sequences or obtain targeted vascular imaging. Otherwise, routine contrast does not improve detection of traumatic injury and should be avoided to minimize cost, time, and rare but real risks, especially in vulnerable populations [^a676a805] [^9b7545b5].

> Bottom line, after reconsidering the evidence and guidelines, routine contrast is not needed for MRI in post-traumatic headache. Non-contrast brain MRI with trauma-appropriate sequences is the appropriate first choice when MRI is indicated, and contrast should be reserved for specific clinical suspicions such as infection, neoplasm, vascular injury, or CSF leak where it will change management [^a676a805] [^9b7545b5].

In most patients with headache after head injury, **MRI without contrast is sufficient** to evaluate for traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, or structural lesions [^a676a805]. Contrast is **only needed when there is suspicion** of infection, tumor, or vascular abnormality (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, neoplasm, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) [^81f89b23] [^6b3dbe10]. Routine contrast use is not recommended because it adds little diagnostic value and carries risks such as allergic reactions and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^9b7545b5]. Use contrast only when clinical features or prior imaging suggest a secondary process that would change management [^notfound].

---

## Indications for MRI after head injury

MRI is **indicated after head injury** in the following scenarios:

- **Persistent or worsening neurological symptoms**: Cognitive deficits, focal neurological deficits, or seizures persisting beyond the acute phase [^a676a805].

- **Chronic or persistent headaches**: Headaches lasting beyond three months post-injury, especially if progressive or accompanied by new neurological symptoms [^8295f2e1].

- **Suspected complications**: Suspected chronic subdural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury, or other structural brain injuries not adequately visualized by CT [^7b4ed228].

---

## Role of contrast in MRI

Contrast agents, typically gadolinium-based, enhance visualization of certain structures and pathologies by increasing tissue contrast. However, contrast administration is **not without risks**, including allergic reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (especially in patients with renal impairment), and additional costs and time.

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus provide clear recommendations on the use of contrast in MRI for patients with headaches after head injury:

- **Non-contrast MRI is sufficient**: Non-contrast MRI is generally sufficient for evaluating traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and structural lesions [^a676a805].

- **Contrast reserved for specific indications**: Contrast-enhanced MRI is reserved for specific clinical suspicions such as infection, tumor, or vascular abnormalities (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, neoplasm, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) [^81f89b23].

- **Routine contrast not recommended**: Routine use of contrast in MRI for post-traumatic headaches is not recommended due to low diagnostic yield and potential risks [^9b7545b5].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting contrast-enhanced MRI

While non-contrast MRI is sufficient in most cases, certain clinical scenarios **warrant contrast-enhanced MRI**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for contrast** |
|-|-|
| Suspected infection (meningitis, encephalitis) | Yes |
| Suspected tumor or neoplasm | Yes |
| Suspected vascular abnormality (e.g. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) | Yes |
| Persistent or unexplained neurological deficits with suspicion of underlying pathology | Yes |
| Routine evaluation of post-traumatic headache without specific suspicion of secondary pathology | No |

---

## Risks and limitations of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI carries potential risks and limitations, including:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents.

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis**: Risk associated with gadolinium-based agents, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

- **Additional time and cost**: Contrast administration increases examination time and cost.

- **Limited diagnostic yield**: Routine contrast use in post-traumatic headaches has been shown to have low diagnostic yield, with most significant findings detectable on non-contrast MRI [^9b7545b5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-contrast MRI is sufficient**: Non-contrast MRI is generally sufficient for evaluating headaches after head injury, particularly for detecting traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and structural lesions [^a676a805].

- **Contrast reserved for specific indications**: Contrast-enhanced MRI should be reserved for specific clinical suspicions such as infection, tumor, or vascular abnormalities [^81f89b23].

- **Routine contrast not recommended**: Routine use of contrast in MRI for post-traumatic headaches is not recommended due to low diagnostic yield and potential risks [^9b7545b5].

### Approach to acute headache in adults [^75553b0e]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of the adult population worldwide is affected by a headache disorder. The International Headache Society classification and diagnostic criteria can help physicians differentiate primary headaches (e.g., tension, migraine, cluster) from secondary headaches (e.g., those caused by infection or vascular disease). A thorough history and physical examination, and an understanding of the typical features of primary headaches, can reduce the need for neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, or other studies. Some red flag signs and symptoms identified in the history or during a physical examination can indicate serious underlying pathology and will require neuroimaging or other testing to evaluate the cause of headache. Red flag signs and symptoms include focal neurologic signs, papilledema, neck stiffness, an immunocompromised state, sudden onset of the worst headache in the patient's life, personality changes, headache after trauma, and headache that is worse with exercise. If an intracranial hemorrhage is suspected, head computed tomography without contrast media is recommended. For most other dangerous causes of headache, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography is acceptable.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® headache [^1b7b8f97]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Headache is one of the most common human afflictions. In most cases, headaches are benign and idiopathic, and resolve spontaneously or with minor therapeutic measures. Imaging is not required for many types of headaches. However, patients presenting with headaches in the setting of "red flags" such as head trauma, cancer, immunocompromised state, pregnancy, patients 50 years or older, related to activity or position, or with a corresponding neurological deficit, may benefit from CT, MRI, or noninvasive vascular imaging to identify a treatable cause. This publication addresses the initial imaging strategies for headaches associated with the following features: severe and sudden onset, optic disc edema, "red flags", migraine or tension-type, trigeminal autonomic origin, and chronic headaches with and without new or progressive features. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Change in headache suffering and predictors of headache after mild traumatic brain injury: a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study with twelve-month follow-up [^ea8c7f99]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbation of headache during the first 3 months after MTBI is likely related to the head injury, and predictors for acute HAIH were female sex and pathological imaging findings on CT or MR. However, many patients will experience improvement of their headache before reaching 12 months post-injury. Patients exposed to MTBI should be advised against overuse of analgesics, and management of patients with persistent HAIH should include treatment against MOH when medication overuse is suspected.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that the majority of emergency patients with non-traumatic headache do not present significant abnormalities in MRI. Even with significant predictors indicating abnormal findings, predictive modeling to promote using neuroimaging judiciously remains a challenge. Larger populations with complete clinical characterization may be needed to create more accurate predictive models for emergency MRI.

### Don't perform CT imaging for headache when MRI is… [^5f4ddba0]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

When neuroimaging for headache is indicated, MRI is preferred over CT, except in emergency settings when hemorrhage, acute stroke, or head trauma are suspected. MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of neoplasm, vascular disease, posterior fossa and cervicomedullary lesions, and high and low intracranial pressure disorders. CT of the head is associated with substantial radiation exposure, which may elevate the risk of later cancers, while there are no known biologic risks from MRI.

### ACR-ASNR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of computed tomography (CT) of the head [^90af7c2f]. ASNR/ACR/SPR (2025). High credibility.

Head CT modality comparison and screening role — CT of the head is superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for rapid assessment in emergent/urgent settings, particularly for the evaluation of osseous structures, acute hemorrhage, and calcifications. CT of the brain is sufficient and diagnostic in many clinical circumstances, such as in acute trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, evaluation of ventricle size, and selected postoperative follow-up. However, CT is less useful than MRI for many conditions that require higher contrast resolution, such as neoplastic, infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory conditions affecting the cranial nerves, brain parenchyma, and meninges. In combination with the clinical history and physical examination findings, CT of the brain is a useful screening tool for indications such as acute mental status change, seizure, acute neurologic deficit, acute headache, and nonacute headache with neurologic findings. While MRI is a more sensitive modality for detection of parenchymal abnormalities, CT can be useful to screen for mass effect and addition of intravenous contrast may increase sensitivity for masses, infection, or vascular abnormalities when MRI is not available.

Adult emergency department acute headache — patient management recommendations for suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) state: Level B recommendations: Use a normal noncontrast head CT performed within 6 hours of symptom onset in an ED headache patient with a normal neurologic examination, to rule out nontraumatic SAH. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: None specified. Potential benefit is that selected patients will no longer need to be subjected to LP or CTA as part of ruling out SAH, while potential harms include that LP after a normal head CT is a long-standing diagnostic regimen that will occasionally reveal alternative diagnoses and, if not performed, these diagnoses may be missed, and that use of the recommendation could result in a rare missed SAH.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^6e32d9ea]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Turku University Hospital, an academic tertiary care referral center with an approximate patient catchment area of 480 000. It constitutes the third largest hospital district in Finland. During the study period, the emergency radiology department had a Philips Ingenia 3 Tesla system dedicated to emergency imaging only.

We obtained permission from the hospital district board for this study, and patient consent was waived due to its retrospective nature. We first identified 8 772 unique emergency MRI scans conducted between 4/2014 and 1/2019 from picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and radiological information systems (RIS) using standard MRI codes. The MRI protocols varied, but most included routine sequences such as T1- and T2-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), 3D time-of-flight (TOF) arterial angiography, and contrast-enhanced (CE) MRV (selected patients). Imaging data were cross-referenced with those from electronic medical records (EMR).

To identify cases with non-traumatic headache, we first queried referrals with the word "headache". This search identified 1 862 cases. We excluded already hospitalized inpatients, postoperative patients, patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and patients with a recent head injury. We included all emergency outpatients with non-traumatic headache, regardless of whether the headache was the main symptom, as the proportional significance of headache among all symptoms would be difficult to evaluate retrospectively in these emergency patients. A total of 696 patient cases were included in this study. From the referrals, we recorded the patients' demographic characteristics, medical history, and other meaningful clinical features mentioned (other symptoms and duration of headache before referral for MRI). Imaging findings were recorded from the MRI reports. Scans with no new findings or notable progression in brain diseases were considered normal. Final diagnoses were then collected from the EMR.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging? [^8390a6e9]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized by the mnemonic POUNDing (Pulsating, duration of 4–72 hOurs, Unilateral, Nausea, Disabling). If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio (LR) for definite or possible migraine is 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–388); if 3 are met, the LR is 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and if 2 or fewer are met, the LR is 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32–0.52). For the neuroimaging question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious intracranial abnormality: cluster-type headache (LR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.2–52); abnormal findings on neurologic examination (LR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.4–12); undefined headache (ie, not cluster-, migraine-, or tension-type) (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0–7.1); headache with aura (LR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.6); headache aggravated by exertion or a valsalva-like maneuver (LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8); and headache with vomiting (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6). No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions.

Conclusions

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose migraine. Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant intracranial abnormality, and patients with these features should undergo neuroimaging.

### Imaging evaluation of the patient with worst headache of life – it's not all subarachnoid hemorrhage [^be9bfb88]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The radiologist working in the emergency radiology setting is often faced with evaluating imaging findings of the patient whose chief complaint is that of the worst headache of life. The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is usually the initial consideration before imaging is performed and, appropriately, must be quickly diagnosed. However, a number of entities can simulate SAH on imaging studies. Those entities are presented here. In addition, a number of disease processes other than SAH can produce worst headache of life. Some of the most important entities, and their CT and MR findings, are reviewed here.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^6c03f058]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis

SAH should be considered in all patients presenting with sudden-onset severe headaches. Among other presenting features, seizures are observed in approximately 6% of patients. Focal neurological deficits are usually associated with an intraparenchymal haematoma or the location of an aneurysm, e.g. an oculomotor nerve palsy with pupillary dysfunction is associated with enlargement or rupture of the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Among patients presenting with an acute nontraumatic headache that has reached maximal intensity within one hour and intact neurology, the Ottawa rules are very sensitive for identifying an SAH but with low specificity. A non-contrast CT scan of the head (CTH), usually modern third-generation CTH, is 100% specific and highly sensitive for aSAH if scanned in the first 6 h of headache onset, the sensitivity decreases to 97% in the first 72 h and further decreases by 50% in 5 days. If CTH performed ≥ 6 h after the ictus is equivocal or negative, a lumbar puncture performed within 6–12 h of symptom onset typically shows xanthochromia. Unlike CT, xanthochromia is present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in all patients up to 2 weeks post ictus; false positive results can occur from a traumatic lumbar puncture.

For handling aSAH, computed tomographic and digital subtraction angiography play significant roles. CTA, as a less invasive and readily accessible option, is the first investigation to consider. Apart from identifying aneurysms, it also aids in planning the repair. However, in inconclusive CTA results, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), the gold standard in angiography, is recommended. Furthermore, stereotactic angiography with 3-dimensional rotational capabilities proves valuable for detecting aSAH aneurysms, except when previously diagnosed by a noninvasive angiogram. It contributes to treatment planning and assessing an aneurysm's suitability for endovascular coiling or surgery. DSA has the added benefit of offering an endovascular treatment and minimal complication rates of 1%. Importantly, studies comparing CTA and DSA indicate strong agreement, suggesting they both provide high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing vasospasm.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an alternative to CTA or DSA for aneurysm detection, especially in patients allergic to iodine. MRA does not expose the patients to radiation, and the time-of-flight sequence does not require contrast. MRA is not very sensitive when done early after symptom onset due to high oxygen concentration in CSF. Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) is 95% sensitive for aneurysms > 3 mm; the main disadvantages are availability, cost, and acquisition time.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^49b9e334]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Headache neuroimaging modalities and radiation exposure — selection and technology considerations state that, according to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for Headache, CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head remains the best choice for headache imaging when imaging is necessary, and some patients need cerebrovascular imaging such as CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The document notes rapid CT evolution to multi-slice scanners with up to 320 detectors and specifies that CT scans expose the patient to approximately 2 mSv compared with one chest radiograph at 0.02 mSv.

### Contrast-enhanced brain MRI for ambulatory evaluation of headache: comprehensive or excessive? [^9b7545b5]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Headache is one of the most common indications for brain MR imaging. Our purpose was to assess the necessity and yield of contrast-enhanced brain MRI protocols relative to noncontrast protocols for the outpatient evaluation of headache in adults.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 874 consecutive adult outpatient brain contrast-enhanced MRIs for the indication of headache. Examination impressions were reviewed for any findings contributing to headache and stratified into 18 categories. Incidental findings unrelated to headache but mentioned in the report impressions were recorded. A subset of 100 contrast-relevant cases were selected for independent blinded review by 2 neuroradiologists first without contrast and then after a 3-week washout period, with and without contrast. Reviewers were asked to classify cases as positive/negative and to describe relevant findings. Specific diagnoses were compared between reviews and readers on a case-by-case basis. Intrareader agreement was calculated between noncontrast and postcontrast reviews.

Results

Eighteen percent of examinations had findings potentially related to headaches. Two percent of cases were deemed contrast relevant. Incidental findings were reported in 4% of cases. On the blinded double review, the percentage of positive cases remained essentially unchanged, decreasing by 1.5% with contrast-enhanced images available. All intra- and extra-axial masses associated with parenchymal edema were detected without contrast. Detection rate of small, incidental meningiomas doubled on postcontrast sequences.

Conclusions

Routine acquisition of contrast-enhanced MRIs for outpatients with an indication of headache had a low yield. Noncontrast examinations demonstrated similar sensitivity for actionable intracranial pathology, while contrast-enhanced MRIs doubled the detection rate of incidental meningiomas. A more practical initial approach may be starting with noncontrast examinations with callbacks or additional imaging for a small percentage of patients.

### Neuroimaging and diagnostic workup for headache [^b3c7feff]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging can play a vital role in headache evaluation, though its utilization must be judicious and evidence-based. While a comprehensive clinical assessment is always fundamental, imaging is essential for the diagnosis of many headache disorders. There exist several guidelines for headache imaging, but overutilization of imaging and missed diagnoses due to inappropriate imaging selection remain a significant challenge. This article examines the role of neuroimaging in primary and secondary headache disorders, discusses the strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities, and provides a practical framework for optimizing imaging utilization while maintaining resource efficiency.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^e4a157f4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Headache imaging in pregnancy — ACOG suggests evaluation of headaches in pregnancy that warrant brain or vascular imaging with magnetic resonance techniques that limit the use of gadolinium (CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Gadolinium contrast crosses the placenta and is generally avoided; computerized tomography (CT) may be performed in pregnancy if dictated by diagnostic workup and should be used if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available and imaging is warranted. For suspected stroke, CT is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice with a goal of presentation to imaging time of 25 minutes or less. Fetal risks after exposure to ionizing radiation from a CT scan are considered minimal, with human developmental risks only associated with exposures greater than 50 mGy and head CT in the range fetal dose 0.001–0.01 mGy. Brief iodinated contrast exposure has not had reported clinical sequelae, and contrast is generally recommended only if required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will affect care.

### Change in headache suffering and predictors of headache after mild traumatic brain injury: a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study with twelve-month follow-up [^760c88de]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Study variables

Information regarding the injury resulting in an MTBI and clinical symptoms at the ED, including information about alcohol influence at the time of injury, was collected through medical records and by interviewing the participants. The GCS score was observed by the study personnel or recorded from the medical record. If lacking, the history and clinical descriptions in the medical records were used to estimate a score. This method was used on 29 (7.7%) of the MTBI participants. Duration of PTA was recorded as the time after injury for which the patient had no continuous memory (< 1 h, or 1–24 h). Previous MTBI was defined as having experienced one or more head injuries fulfilling diagnostic criteria for MTBI. The clinical radiology report was used to classify CT findings into intracranial findings and cranial fractures. An MRI examination was performed on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Skyra System (3T, susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI], fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) if the patient lived within a 1-h drive, there was a time slot for MRI available within 72 h, and the patient consented to MRI (see Supplementary Appendix S1 for protocol). Intracranial traumatic pathology and cranial fractures on MRI or CT were dichotomized into "imaging findings on CT or MRI" (yes/no).

Headache variables

Information regarding the participants' headache status was collected through self-administered questionnaires at three points in time (Fig. 1). In the questionnaire at baseline the participants were asked the headache screening question, "Have you suffered from headache during the last year?"; those who answered "yes" were recorded as suffering from headache at baseline. Participants answering "yes" to the headache screening question answered the subsequent headache questions that enabled classification into definite migraine, probable migraine, and tension-type headache (TTH) according to the ICHD-3 criteria. The participants answered the same headache questions after 3 and 12 months and were then asked to report headache during the previous 3 and 9 months, respectively.

FIG. 1
Timeline illustrating the time periods covered in each questionnaire. Baseline questionnaire: headache suffering last 12 months prior to injury (MTBI and trauma controls) or first questionnaire (community controls). Three-month questionnaire: headache suffering the first 3 months post-injury. Twelve-month questionnaire: headache suffering 3–12 months post-injury. MTBI, mild traumatic brain injury.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^075accad]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) — preprocedural cranial imaging and modality selection before epidural blood patch (EBP): No experimental or observational studies have directly addressed whether cranial imaging is required before an EBP for PDPH. In the absence of direct evidence from the literature, a reasonable approach is to perform cranial imaging after suspected dural puncture when headaches are associated with 'red-flag' symptoms such as new neurological deficits, when headache symptoms change from orthostatic to non-orthostatic, or when patients are otherwise at high risk for conditions that may coexist with PDPH such as SDH, CVST or PRES. Statement: Current evidence is insufficient to assess the risk-benefit balance for routine cranial imaging before EBP for PDPH (Low Level of Certainty). Both CT scan of the head and MRI of the brain may be appropriate for patients with severe non-orthostatic headaches.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^a5fd76d9]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric headache imaging in the emergency department notes that Less than 3% of children who present to the ED with headache are diagnosed with serious neurologic disorders, and that neuroimaging affects management in < 6% of children with headache even though up to one-third undergo neuroimaging. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners consider neuroimaging in children with an abnormal neurologic examination and/or the coexistence of seizures and in those in whom the history indicates the recent onset of severe headache, change in type of headache, or associated features that suggest neurologic dysfunction. Once neuroimaging is deemed necessary, there are 2 options: CT or MRI; for concern for acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for pediatric headache recommends noncontrast CT as the best imaging choice, and lumbar puncture or CT angiogram (CTA) may be needed to definitively exclude the diagnosis. For children with signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurologic findings, MRI (without contrast or with and without contrast) is preferred over CT. If there is clinical concern for ischemic stroke, the use of MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia. If cerebral venous thrombosis is suspected, a normal head CT does not rule out the diagnosis and definitive imaging such as CT venography or magnetic resonance venography is preferred; similarly, CT imaging may be normal in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and MRI is recommended. Although contrast-enhanced MRI may be used for specific diagnoses, noncontrast MRI is the study of choice for most children with headaches when imaging is being obtained, and radiologists recommend judicious use of gadolinium-based contrast agents until more data are available. Proposed noncontrast rapid brain MRI sequences require less time (eg, 5–11 min) than full protocols and may be a reasonable alternative to CT for children with headaches. The ordering physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner may consider consultation with a radiologist in the absence of already established protocols to discuss the optimal imaging modality.

### ACR appropriateness criteria head trauma [^6b3dbe10]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging plays an important role in the management of head trauma. Several guidelines have been published for identifying which patients can avoid neuroimaging. Noncontrast head CT is the most appropriate initial examination in patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury who require neuroimaging as well as patients with moderate to severe acute closed head injury. In short-term follow-up neuroimaging of acute traumatic brain injury, CT and MRI may have complementary roles. In subacute to chronic traumatic brain injury, MRI is the most appropriate initial examination, though CT may have a complementary role in select circumstances. Advanced neuroimaging techniques are areas of active research but are not considered routine clinical practice at this time. In suspected intracranial vascular injury, CT angiography or venography or MR angiography or venography is the most appropriate imaging study. In suspected posttraumatic cerebrospinal fluid leak, high-resolution noncontrast skull base CT is the most appropriate initial imaging study to identify the source, with cisternography reserved for problem solving. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Headache management in traumatic brain injury [^3a31fad6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated to rank as the third most important disease burden worldwide. About 60% of the survivors develop chronic headaches and visual symptoms, and the long-term management of headaches in these patients is controversial. Importantly, the care pathway of most patients is fragmented, complicating conclusive headache management. Here we review the epidemiology and aetiology of post traumatic headaches (PTH), discuss the diagnostic work up and summarise the acute and long-term management.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^15ca66ca]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The task force decided a priori to make an attempt to keep the guidelines applicable to the complete patient spectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury can be managed according to the guidelines.

Certain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT, would be regarded only as a secondary management option. The use of plain skull films was addressed and rejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, we chose not to consider later aspects of management, such as detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreed that all pathological findings on head CT should lead to hospital admission. Finally, we would not address the surgical or medical management of intracranial complications.

The task force was unclear concerning the selection of patients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal, mild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclear concerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scan results, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensus was achieved to address two important clinical questions that would require systematic review of evidence and would form the basis of the updated guidelines, shown below.

Clinical question 1: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and which patients may be directly discharged?'.

Clinical question 2: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital observation and/or a repeat head CT?'.

### Utility of cranial MRI in non-traumatic headache patients with prior negative head CT within 1 month [^6c92a489]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the importance of additional cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in non-traumatic headache patients with a prior negative head computed tomography (CT) examination within 1 month.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study analysed 162 adult patients with non-traumatic headache who underwent cMRI within 1 month of a negative initial head CT at the emergency department (ED). The diagnostic yield and false-referral rate were analysed according to the revisit duration (early [≤ 1 week] versus late [> 1–4 weeks] revisits), patient care settings (ED versus outpatient clinics [OPC]), and clinical variables. Subsequent patient management change (PMC), such as admission and treatment (AT) or outpatient clinic treatment (OT), were also investigated.

Results

The overall diagnostic yield of cMRI was 17.3% (28/162) and the false-referral rate was 1.2% (2/162). The diagnostic yield of cMRI was significantly different according to the patient care settings (ED, 24.7% [21/85] versus OPC, 9.1% [7/77]; p = 0.02). The diagnostic yield was highest in the ED-early-revisit group (25.4% [18/71]), 45% (9/20) in those with systemic signs, and 46.7% (14/30) in those with symptom change. Among patients with positive cMRI findings, 90% (27/30) received AT and 3.3% (1/30) received OT. Among OPC-revisit-negative cMRI patients, PMC occurred in 0% (0/50).

Conclusion

The diagnostic yield of cMRI was relatively high for headache patients who revisited the ED earlier, especially in those with systemic signs or symptom change. Most positive cMRI cases experienced PMC. Negative cMRI in OPC-revisit patients might help clarify the benign nature of a condition.

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^552c9a0d]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Concussions/mild traumatic brain injuries are very common neurological injuries that can cause physical, cognitive, and psychological dysfunction. The most common acute post-concussion symptom is headache (often referred to as post-traumatic headache or PTH). The acute headache following a concussion may persist for days, weeks or months post injury. The International Headache Society Classification of Headache Disorders Third Edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria 5.1 for acute headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head and 5.1.2 acute headache attributed to a mild traumatic injury to the head are outlined in Figure 1 (3). When the headaches continues for more than 3 months post-injury, ICHD-3 defines them as persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. To meet criteria for persistent headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head, individuals would have first had to meet criteria for acute headaches attributed to traumatic injury to the head. These ICHD-3 criteria are largely based upon the consensus opinion of an expert panel rather than being evidence-based given the paucity of data in this area. Furthermore, these criteria do not identify any characteristic or defining headache quality, location, frequency, duration, associated symptoms, triggering or aggravating factors.

In terms of onset timing, the ICHD-3 criteria require that the headache develop within 7 days after injury (or after regaining consciousness or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing ability to sense or report headache). There has been debate regarding the validity of this time frame with some suggesting that the interval should be shorter and others suggesting that the interval should be extended out as far as thirty days post-injury or longer (3,6,7); indeed the appendix of the ICHD-3 proposes research criteria that extend the interval between traumatic injury to the head and headache onset out to ninety days (so called "delayed-onset" headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head). These divergent views demonstrate the need to evaluate and field-test the diagnostic criteria.

Despite its high prevalence, relatively little is known about acute and persistent PTH in terms of the epidemiology, headache characteristics, predictive factors for headache recovery or persistence, imaging correlates, and the role of genetics. The pathophysiology of acute PTH is not well understood. PTH results from physical forces that may precipitate headache de novo in a non-headache prone individual, initiate a new headache type in someone with pre-injury episodic or chronic headaches, or may exacerbate an existing primary headache disorder.

### Management of patients presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset severe headache: systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^59e14fa5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020173265). This paper conforms to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies statement.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Eighteen databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) were systematically searched in February 2020. Further details of the search strategy are presented in online supplemental file 1. To meet inclusion criteria, studies had to assess any care pathway for ruling out SAH (including clinical decision rules and specific diagnostic tests, such as CT or LP) in neurologically intact adult patients presenting to hospital with a sudden onset severe headache (reaching maximum intensity within 1 hour), with a clinical suspicion of SAH. Studies of patients who had suffered a head injury (ie, traumatic headache) were excluded. Any primary study design (other than single case study) was eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest included diagnostic accuracy, quality of life and adverse events. Two researchers (MW and RW) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved records and subsequently all full text publications for inclusion. Disagreements at each stage of the study selection process were resolved through discussion. Authors of potentially relevant conference abstracts were contacted for additional information. Relevant foreign language studies were translated and included in the review.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data were extracted on study methods, patient, intervention and reference standard characteristics, outcome measures, adverse events and results (presented in online supplemental file 2). Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one researcher and independently checked by a second. The majority of studies were assessed for quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. The QUADAS-2 tool was not appropriate for studies where a reference standard test was not used, therefore, a quality assessment tool was developed by RW specifically for the review, piloted and refined before use (see online supplemental file 3 for details).

### Change in headache suffering and predictors of headache after mild traumatic brain injury: a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study with twelve-month follow-up [^ab7eb6e9]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective, controlled study, MTBI participants had a larger increase in odds of headache from baseline to the first 3 months post-injury than both control groups, but the change in odds of headache from baseline to 3–12 months post-injury did not differ between the groups. Predictors for acute HAIH were female sex and pathological imaging findings on CT or MRI. For persistent HAIH the predictors were prior MTBI, being injured under the influence of alcohol, and acute HAIH.

The patients with MTBI had a significant increase in odds of headache between baseline and the first 3 months post-injury and between baseline and 3–12 months post-injury. From the first 3 months post-injury to 3–12 months post-injury they had a decrease in odds of headache. The increase in odds of headache from baseline to the first 3 months post-injury was significantly larger for the MTBI group than for trauma controls and the community controls. However, the ORs of headache from baseline to 3–12 months post-injury did not differ between the groups. We also saw, somewhat surprisingly, that the control groups had an increase in headache suffering from baseline to 3–12 months post-injury, but this was only statistically significant for community controls.

This increase in odds of headache suffering in the control groups, seen together with the decrease in odds of headache suffering from the first 3 months post-injury to 3–12 months post-injury in the MTBI group could explain why the MTBI group did not differ from the control groups between baseline and 3–12 months post-injury. The increase in odds of headache suffering from baseline to 3–12 months post-injury in the control groups could have been caused by participation bias (those who suffer from headache are more likely to continue answering the questionnaires throughout the study); another explanation could be that we had a young study population and many of our study participants were in the age where headache disorders start. But this could also be a demonstration of the dynamic course of headache. In a study of a random sample of 5,000 adults selected from five general practices in the United Kingdom, the authors showed that 24% of respondents without recent headache (last 3 months) at baseline reported headache in at least one follow-up the following year. Hence, increase in headache suffering could be observed also in persons not exposed to a head injury.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^ecfb5ca4]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-traumatic headaches are among the most common neurological complaints in emergency departments (ED), reported in ~ 1–4% of patients. They can be classified as either primary or secondary, depending on their etiology. In the emergency setting, various secondary causes of headache can be ruled out by using neuroimaging, which might cause severe neurological morbidity or even death.

Major neuroimaging findings among outpatients presenting with non-traumatic headache are rare, and concern < 10% of these patients. Studies using computed tomography (CT) have found secondary causes in 13–15% of emergency patients who had undergone cranial CT for headache, which were mostly intracranial hemorrhages or ischemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a suitable alternative, with superior soft tissue characterization and no ionizing radiation, but only a few studies have investigated its yield in an emergency setting. Budweg et al. reported that ~22% (18/82) of their walk-in outpatients had at least potentially significant findings that explained acute headaches. Gilbert et al. found that instead of increasing the prevalence of significant findings, increasing neuroimaging for headaches decreased it. Their results underline the need for support in clinical decision-making regarding the use of imaging to make it more judicious.

Several clinical risk scores have been developed for non-traumatic headache to reduce unnecessary imaging. In these studies, the most frequently presented predictors of intracranial pathology have been age > 50 years, focal neurological deficit, nausea/vomiting, and altered mental status. However, most of these prediction models have been developed for cranial CT. Budweg et al. presented a clinical score for MRI, but so far it has not been validated in a prospective study setting.

The aims of this study were to explore emergency MRI findings regarding non-traumatic headache in outpatients presenting to the ED, and to describe these findings in terms of clinical significance. We also aimed to demonstrate factors related to significant imaging outcomes to aid clinical decision-making in the emergency setting.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® head Trauma: 2021 update [^bce43f62]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Head trauma (ie, head injury) is a significant public health concern and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. Neuroimaging plays an important role in the management of head and brain injury, which can be separated into acute (0–7 days), subacute (< 3 months), then chronic (> 3 months) phases. Over 75% of acute head trauma is classified as mild, of which over 75% have a normal Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, therefore clinical practice guidelines universally recommend selective CT scanning in this patient population, which is often based on clinical decision rules. While CT is considered the first-line imaging modality for suspected intracranial injury, MRI is useful when there are persistent neurologic deficits that remain unexplained after CT, especially in the subacute or chronic phase. Regardless of time frame, head trauma with suspected vascular injury or suspected cerebrospinal fluid leak should also be evaluated with CT angiography or thin-section CT imaging of the skull base, respectively. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Post-traumatic headache due to mild traumatic brain injury: current knowledge and future directions [^b114caab]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Post-traumatic headache is one of the most common and persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an update on the diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of post-traumatic headache, and to identify future research priorities.

Methods

This is a narrative review of the literature regarding post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury.

Results

Onset of post-traumatic headache within 7 days of injury is the only evidence for a causal relationship between the injury and the headache included in the diagnostic criteria. Post-traumatic headache often resolves within the first few days of onset, whereas it persists for at least 3 months in 30–50%. The majority of insights into post-traumatic headache pathophysiology come from pre-clinical animal studies and human imaging studies, which implicate structural, functional, metabolic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms for post-traumatic headache. There is a paucity of quality evidence for how to best treat post-traumatic headache.

Conclusions

Although meaningful progress has been made in the post-traumatic headache field, priorities for future research are numerous, including the optimization of diagnostic criteria, a greater understanding of post-traumatic headache pathophysiology, identifying mechanisms and predictors for post-traumatic headache persistence, and identifying safe, well-tolerated, effective therapies.

### Change in headache suffering and predictors of headache after mild traumatic brain injury: a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study with twelve-month follow-up [^6f889017]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Headache is more prevalent among women than men in the general population. In our study, female sex was a significant positive predictor of acute HAIH. This is in line with several other studies that have shown female sex to be a risk factor of HAIH.,

Imaging findings on CT or MRI (intracranial traumatic pathology and/or cranial fractures) were a significant positive predictor of acute HAIH but not persistent HAIH. However, in a recent study from Korea, the authors found that HAIH occurred more frequently 12 months post-injury in patients with minimal traumatic intracranial hemorrhage after MTBI than in those without. Research on imaging findings as a predictor for headache is scarce, but some studies have investigated imaging findings as a predictor for post-concussive symptoms (PCS), a cluster of post-traumatic symptoms, including headache. A prospective study from Finland found no significant differences in the rates of PCS 1 month and 1 year following MTBI, in participants with or without MRI abnormalities. A prospective study from the United States found no statistically significant differences in the rates of PCS at 3 or 6 months following MTBI between participants with or without imaging findings on CT or MRI.

Prior MTBI was a significant positive predictor of persistent HAIH in our study. This is consistent with several previous studies. A retrospective study that examined the risk of CDH found that the odds of CDH increased with the number of lifetime head or neck injuries. In a previous population-based historical cohort study, we found that subjects having more than one head injury showed an even greater odds of headache compared with controls than all individuals exposed to head injury without specification of iteration. Finally, in a study aiming to predict which patients were at risk for developing PCS (with a median duration of 19 weeks), multiple head injuries was one of the predictors

Being injured under the influence of alcohol was another significant positive predictor of persistent HAIH. We cannot conclude whether being injured under the influence of alcohol is a proxy for a generally high alcohol consumption or if being injured under the influence of alcohol is a true risk factor of developing HAIH. The association between alcohol influence at the time of injury and the damage that occurs in the brain must be examined specifically to answer this question.

Finally, we found that acute HAIH was a significant positive predictor for persistent HAIH. This is in line with the results from a Norwegian study that examined predictors of headache 22 years following head injury.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^c277c205]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the major strengths of this study is the routine use of MRI in the emergency radiology department and a large sample size. In addition, this study represents a true clinical situation and offers a real-world overview of emergency patients with non-traumatic headache. We utilized a data-driven approach by querying the referrals for specific symptoms, instead of relying on diagnosis codes.

Our study is limited by its retrospective design. All the relevant data may not have been available from the emergency referrals. Some referrals may have been incomplete or imprecise, and therefore the true prevalence of risk factors may have been underestimated. In addition to specific symptoms, relevant comorbidities and medical history may have been missing. Lack of relevant data may have contributed to the performance of the predictive model. Regarding symptoms, a potential limitation of our study is that we could not reliably record from the referral data whether headache was the primary presenting symptom. However, the rate of significant findings was not significantly different between patients with only headache and those with additional symptoms (Table 1), suggesting that our results are not significantly biased because of this limitation. A prospective confirmation of current findings in the future is warranted before claims of clinical utility can be made.

Our results are only applicable to emergency MRI, which may not be suitable or readily available in all institutions, whereas CT is usually the method of choice in acute neuroimaging of headache patients. We focused on the first-line use of emergency MRI and did not include headache patients undergoing CT only. Regarding generalizability, our study is limited by the fact that we did not include headache patients not scheduled for emergency MRI. Therefore, we do not know the factors that contributed to the need for emergency MRI. Our results on the diagnostic yield are only generalizable to patients deemed to require emergency neuroimaging, with the goal of identifying patients in whom imaging is unlikely to yield significant findings. These results provide novel information on the diagnostic yield in this patient group when emergency MRI is readily available and commonly used in the emergency department. Regarding the clinical value of emergency MRI findings, MRI likely altered the clinical management of patients with newly discovered neurological disorders such as cerebrovascular disease (including acute infarction), demyelinating and infectious disease, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In addition, even patients with worrisome symptoms who had normal emergency MRI may have been safely discharged.

### No evidence of intracranial hypotension in persistent post-traumatic headache: a magnetic resonance imaging study [^55ad57b2]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundPersistent post-traumatic headache (PTH) is frequent, and intracranial hypotension may be an important cause of PTH. The present study aimed to examine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of intracranial hypotension are more frequent in people with persistent PTH than in healthy controls (HCs). MethodsAdults with persistent PTH attributed to mild traumatic brain injury and age- and sex-matched HCs attended a single non-contrast, brain MRI 3T session. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery T1- and T2-weighted sequences were acquired to assign a modified Bern score. The score ranges from 0 to 9 points, with higher scores indicating a greater probability of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage leading to intracranial hypotension. The primary outcome was the difference in modified Bern score between participants with persistent PTH and HCs. All images were examined by a certified neuroradiologist who was blinded to the group status. ResultsImaging data from 97 participants with persistent PTH and 96 age- and sex-matched HCs were eligible for analyses. A modified Bern score of ≤ 2 was present in 90 (93%) participants with persistent PTH and 85 (89%) HCs, indicating a low probability of CSF leak. None of the persistent PTH participants or the HCs had a score of > 4. There were no significant differences in modified Bern scores between participants with persistent PTH and HCs. ConclusionsThere is a low prevalence of typical MRI Bern score signs of intracranial hypotension in PTH or HCs. Thus, intracranial hypotension is unlikely to be an underlying factor in persistent PTH attributed to mild traumatic brain injury. Trial RegistrationThe study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT03791515). Date of registration 2018-12-29.

### Chronic subdural haematoma after snowboard head injury [^0382ee47]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Two cases of chronic subdural haematoma following a snowboard head injury are reported. Although such cases are rare in sport, the risk in snowboarders is higher than expected. Evaluation of a snowboarder with a history of head injury, albeit mild, who complains of headaches should include computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to allow rapid identification of any intracranial pathology.

### Posttraumatic headache [^0686a5a3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is a commonly occurring and potentially disabling consequence of concussion and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This brief review highlights recent advances in the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of concussion, mTBI, and PTH.

Recent Findings

Current epidemiological studies suggest that previous estimates of concussion and mTBI incidence are grossly underestimated and have also helped to identify specific activities and demographic groups that might be more susceptible. Concussion results in profound metabolic derangements during which the brain is potentially vulnerable to repeat injury and permanent damage. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging have proven to be effective at identifying these abnormalities both acutely and also weeks after symptoms resolution. To date, there have been no randomized, placebo-controlled studies supporting the efficacy of any treatment for PTH and current therapeutic decisions are guided only by expert opinion and current evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of specific primary headache phenotypes, the most commonly occurring of which is migraine.

Summary

Despite numerous advances in the awareness, pathophysiology, and diagnostic workup of concussion, mTBI, and PTH, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidance regarding treatment.

### Change in headache suffering and predictors of headache after mild traumatic brain injury: a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study with twelve-month follow-up [^51225144]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head (HAIH) is claimed to be the most common sequela following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), but epidemiological evidence is scarce. We explored whether patients with MTBI had an increase in headache suffering following injury compared with controls. We also studied predictors of headache.

The Trondheim MTBI follow-up study is a population-based, controlled, longitudinal study. We recruited patients exposed to MTBI and controls with minor orthopedic injuries from a trauma center and a municipal outpatient clinic, and community controls from the surrounding population. Information on headache was collected through questionnaires at baseline, and 3 and 12 months post-injury. We used a generalized linear mixed model to investigate the development of headache over time in the three groups, and logistic regression to identify predictors of headache.

We included 378 patients exposed to MTBI, 82 trauma controls, and 83 community controls. The MTBI-group had a larger increase in odds of headache from baseline to the first 3 months post-injury than the controls, but not from baseline to 3–12 months post-injury. Predictors for acute HAIH were female sex and pathological imaging findings on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Predictors for persistent HAIH were prior MTBI, being injured under the influence of alcohol, and acute HAIH. Patients who experience HAIH during the first 3 months post-injury have a good chance to improve before 12 months post-injury. Female sex, imaging findings on CT or MRI, prior MTBI, and being injured under the influence of alcohol may predict exacerbation of headache.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^5c65f7ca]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large-scale study of emergency outpatients, we found that the majority who underwent emergency MRI for non-traumatic headache had normal scans, whereas about 20% had significant findings that potentially explained the headache. Thus, about five patients needed to be scanned to diagnose one patient with significant intracranial pathology. Although we found significant predisposing and protective factors, the performance predictive model was only moderate, and the model could not accurately detect patients with headache-related findings. Judicious use of emergency neuroimaging to rule out secondary causes of non-traumatic headache remains a challenge, even using MRI.

Regarding MRI findings in patients with headache in general, a fairly recent meta-analysis by Jang et al. found potentially significant abnormalities assessed by MRI in 5.7% (95% CI: 1.6–20%) of all patients suspected of primary headache. Budweg et al. found that ~22% (18/82) of their walk-in patients had findings that could at least potentially explain their acute headache, of whom 10% (8 patients) had findings that were considered significant. In both studies, only patients with a provisional diagnosis of a primary headache were included. Our data showed that the yield of MRI was higher among emergency patients (20% with significant findings), most likely due to the higher prevalence of severe intracranial acute-onset pathology (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, infarctions, and central nervous system infections). We also decided to cover all emergency outpatients who had non-traumatic headache, including patients with abnormal neurological findings and suspicion of high-risk pathology. Our patients were imaged with significantly shorter latency (96% within 24 h) than that in the previous study by Budweg et al.: 72% of their patients had MRI within three days of presentation, and 54% were imaged on the same day.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^ba6b1828]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During the last 15 years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scans in mild head trauma has dramatically increased. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of this patient population will have intracranial pathology on CT and that fewer than 1% will require neurosurgical intervention. The need to identify these patients from the majority of patients that will have no intracranial pathology must be balanced against both health care costs and patient risk of exposure to ionizing radiation. Unden and colleagues have conducted an extensive literature search and consensus panel to readdress the question of which patients require a CT head after minimal, mild or moderate head trauma and proposed an algorithm that will encompass most of these adult patients, including those on anticoagulation therapy. They have also provided disposition guidelines to address which patients need admission to hospital, including monitoring routines, and which can be safely discharged.

### Action collaborative on traumatic brain injury care: adapted clinical practice guideline [^58dccea7]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outpatient follow-up care for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is inconsistent. The Action Collaborative on TBI Care, convened under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, aimed to standardize management with a clinical practice guideline. The guideline is intended for community-dwelling adults with TBI who are able to care for themselves at hospital discharge or who did not require acute hospital care. Guideline topics were selected and prioritized with input from individuals with lived experience and clinicians. Existing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (k = 18) were identified from systematic literature reviews. Recommendations for each priority topic were extracted from existing guidelines and synthesized using the ADAPTE process. Strength of evidence ratings were assigned based on the American Academy of Family Physician's adaptation of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) through consensus voting. A draft guideline underwent external review by 20 health professional and brain injury organizations. The Action Collaborative on TBI Care guideline provides recommendations for 11 priority topics: (1) confirm the diagnosis; (2) determine whether emergency department evaluation is required; (3) request neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment when indicated; (4) screen for social determinants of health; (5) provide guidance on return to usual activities; (6) educate the patient and family; (7) assess for risk of persistent symptoms; (8) prioritize which symptoms to target first; (9) initiate treatment for posttraumatic headache; (10) screen and initiate treatment for mental health disorders; and (11) decide if and when to refer to specialty care.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^21df26a8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Critical question 1 — risk stratification for emergent neuroimaging in adult ED acute headache provides that Level A recommendations are none specified and Level B recommendations are to use the Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule (≥ 40 years, complaint of neck pain or stiffness, witnessed loss of consciousness, onset with exertion, thunderclap headache, and limited neck flexion on examination) as a decision rule that has high sensitivity to rule out SAH, but low specificity to rule in SAH for patients with a normal neurologic examination result and peak headache severity within 1 hour of onset; although neck pain and stiffness are strongly associated with SAH, do not use a single physical sign and/or symptom to rule out SAH. Level C recommendations are none specified. Potential benefits are that the use of decision rules may reduce incidence of missed SAH in the ED and may expedite care, avoid unnecessary imaging and workup, and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure; a potential harm is that because of its poor specificity, application of the decision rule to the incorrect headache patient population may increase unnecessary testing.

### Evaluating head CT referral quality and appropriateness in an Italian emergency department: a monocentric retrospective study [^317064e8]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 2908 head CT requests were included in the study. The most frequent clinical indications among the examined requests were trauma (38%) and headache (16%). Most head CT scans were reported as negative for urgent brain findings (92%). Among the CT scans reported as positive, subarachnoid hemorrhage was the most frequently described finding. Furthermore, the majority of patients did not undergo CT angiography or MRI within 30 days of their ED admission. Table 3 summarizes the data included in the study.

Quality and appropriateness of head CT referrals

Out of 2908 head CT scan requests, 620 (21%) were adequate (RI-RADS A or B), and 2288 (79%) were inadequate (RI-RADS C or D) in terms of quality. Notably, the majority of the requests (76%) lacked a diagnostic question. Common requests classified as RI-RADS C included: "head CT for traumatic brain injury on novel oral anticoagulants"; "head CT for headache not responding to analgesics".

In 410 (14%) requests, it was not possible to evaluate the appropriateness of the requests according to the ACR guidelines due to the lack of clinical data in the requests themselves. Of these, 43 were classified as RI-RADS A or B and 367 as RI-RADS C or D. Among the 2498 evaluable requests, the majority (73%) were classified as usually appropriate (Table 4).

### Revisiting the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to mild traumatic injury to the head: insights from the toronto concussion study analysis of acute headaches following concussion [^23ea85cb]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

All participants were recruited from the Hull-Ellis Concussion and Research Clinic ("the Clinic") at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute of the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada between January 2016 and December 2018. All participants were referred from surrounding university-affiliated emergency departments (ED) with a diagnosis of concussion. Given the wide array of diagnostic criteria proposed for concussion (e.g. Berlin Consensus on Concussion in Sports, Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation Concussion Guidelines), the diagnosis of concussion was left to the expert clinical judgment of the assessing ED physician. Participants were seen for an initial consultation at the Clinic, and after agreeing to participate in the study provided written informed consent within 7 days of their injury.

Inclusion criteria included: aged between 17–85 years; physician diagnosis of concussion; Glasgow Coma Scale of 13–15; CT scan imaging negative or deemed unnecessary using a validated clinical decision rule; not admitted to hospital post-injury; deemed medically stable by clinic physicians; ability to be seen in clinic within 7 days of the injury and attend regular clinic visits; and able to comprehend English and complete questionnaires/measures in English. Participants were excluded if they had a third-party insurance claim-eligible mechanism of injury (i.e. workplace accident or motor vehicle collision); were symptomatic from a previous concussion that occurred < 3 months ago; were unwilling or unable to comply with the trial follow-up requirements; or unable to provide informed consent.

Research clinic assessments

Participants attending their first visit in the Hull-Ellis Clinic were invited to enroll in the Toronto Concussion Study. At baseline, participants underwent multiple assessments: a patient questionnaire that included demographic information, injury information, and prior health status; a Baseline Headache Questionnaire (assessing pre-injury headache history and initial post-injury headaches); a computerized version of the SCAT-3 symptom checklist; The Sleep and Concussion Questionnaire (SCQ) (which is a Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) that describes and quantifies changes in sleep and wakefulness in response to brain injury), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) psychological symptom questionnaire (administered at the week 2 visit). Participants also underwent neurocognitive testing and a physical examination by the treating physician. Patients were subsequently evaluated weekly for the first eight weeks after their injury followed by visits at week 12 and week 16. Data from follow-up visits were analyzed to assess for headache recovery trajectory and risk factors for persistence and will be presented in separate publications from the Toronto Concussion Study.

### Headache consortium releases guidelines for use of CT… [^11ff98cb]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The guidelines on neuroimaging include a discussion of the pieces of evidence from eight studies that reported sensitivity and specificity data on different clinical findings as they relate to the presence or absence of abnormalities on CT or MRI in patients with nonacute headache. Likelihood ratios were calculated by combining sensitivity and specificity to express the change in the odds of detecting a significant abnormality on CT or MRI if a certain sign or symptom was or was not present. According to the guidelines, the presence of an abnormal finding on the neurologic examination significantly increases the likelihood of an abnormality on CT or MRI. Conversely, the absence of an abnormality on neurologic examination decreases the likelihood of a significant lesion on imaging studies.

In one study of 350 patients, a significant increase in the odds of finding an abnormality on neuroimaging was seen in patients with a rapid increase in the frequency of their headaches, a history of dizziness or lack of coordination, a history of numbness or tingling, or a history of headache awakening the patient from sleep. However, the absence of such clinical features did not reduce the odds of an abnormality on CT or MRI. Consortium members found three studies that described similarities between CT and MRI in patients with headache. However, each of these studies included fewer than 100 patients, with only a small proportion of patients undergoing both CT and MRI. On the basis of the limited data, the consortium members concluded that MRI may be more sensitive than CT in identifying clinically insignificant abnormalities, but MRI may be no more sensitive than CT in identifying clinically significant pathology.

Neuroimaging is not usually warranted in patients with migraine and normal findings on neurologic examination. A lower threshold for CT or MRI may be applicable in patients with atypical features or with headaches that do not fulfill the definition of migraine. These recommendations are based on the finding that an abnormality is unlikely to be found on CT or MRI in patients with migraine and a normal neurologic examination. Because of insufficient evidence, a recommendation regarding neuroimaging in patients with tension-type headaches cannot be made. In two studies, no lesions were found in patients with tension-type headaches and normal neurologic examination. Because of insufficient evidence, recommendations regarding the comparative sensitivity of MRI and CT cannot be made.

The guidelines state that the greater resolution of MRI appears to be of little clinical importance in the evaluation of nonacute headache. No comparative data exist for the effectiveness of CT scanning with and without enhancement.

### Neuroimaging in pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury: relating the current 2018 centers for disease control guideline and the potential of advanced neuroimaging modalities for research and clinical biomarker development [^e26edc2e]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s 2018 Guideline for current practices in pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI; also referred to as concussion herein) systematically identified the best up-to-date practices based on current evidence and, specifically, identified recommended practices regarding computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and skull radiograph imaging. In this article, we discuss types of neuroimaging not discussed in the guideline in terms of their safety for pediatric populations, their potential application, and the research investigating the future use of certain modalities to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI in children. The role of neuroimaging in pediatric mTBI cases should be considered for the potential contribution to children's neural and social development, in addition to the immediate clinical value (as in the case of acute structural findings). Selective use of specific neuroimaging modalities in research has already been shown to detect aspects of diffuse brain injury, disrupted cerebral blood flow, and correlate physiological factors with persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, cognitive decline, headache, and mood changes, following mTBI. However, these advanced neuroimaging modalities are currently limited to the research arena, and any future clinical application of advanced imaging modalities in pediatric mTBI will require robust evidence for each modality's ability to provide measurement of the subtle conditions of brain development, disease, damage, or degeneration, while accounting for variables at both non-injury and time-post-injury epochs. Continued collaboration and communication between researchers and healthcare providers is essential to investigate, develop, and validate the potential of advanced imaging modalities in pediatric mTBI diagnostics and management.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) diagnostic approach with modern noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) emphasizes early imaging: clinicians can use the high sensitivity of noncontrast head CTs within the first 6 hours of onset to reliably rule out SAH without lumbar puncture (LP), and a normal noncontrast head CT within 6 hours in neurologically intact patients is sufficient to preclude further diagnostic workup; if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative findings, further evaluation may be pursued.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^96be83e2]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Non-traumatic headache is one of the most common neurological complaints in emergency departments. A relatively low diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among outpatients has been previously reported, but studies of emergency patients are lacking. We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of emergency MRI among outpatients presenting to the emergency department with non-traumatic headache.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed emergency MRI referrals in a tertiary hospital for non-traumatic headache over a five-year period. We recorded patient characteristics, relevant clinical information from the referrals, and imaging outcomes.

Results

In total, 696 emergency patients with non-traumatic headache underwent MRI, most within 24 h of presentation. Significant findings related to headache were found in 136 (20%) patients, and incidental findings in 22% of patients. In a multivariate model, the predisposing factors of the significant findings were age, smoking, nausea, and signs/symptoms of infection. The protective factors were numbness and history of migraine. A predictive clinical score reached only moderate performance.

Conclusion

Although emergency MRI shows headache-related findings in one in five patients, accurate prediction modeling remains a challenge, even with statistically significant predictors and a large sample size.

### Microstructural brain injury in post-concussion syndrome after minor head injury [^7d13b63a]. Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Head injury is one of the most common injuries in the Western world, with minor head injury accounting for 70–90% of the head injury cases. Despite being classified as minor, as clinically determined by a normal or near-normal level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13–15) and a brief period of loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia, a large proportion of patients suffer from a wide variety of symptoms for months after the injury. This so-called post-concussion syndrome includes symptoms such as headache, fatigue and cognitive complaints such as memory and attention deficits. Despite the subjective severity of these symptoms, conventional imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is generally normal. Upon neuropsychological examination, cognitive deficits, if any, are subtle and most often in the executive domain. Symptoms persisting for more than 3 to 6 months are difficult to treat and can lead to vocational disability, representing a substantial burden to society and healthcare services. The apparent discrepancy between the subjective severity of complaints and the relative lack of objective neuropsychological and imaging findings has led to controversy about this syndrome, and the exact aetiology as well as the neuropathological substrate remain unclear. Age, gender, previous disease, substance abuse, litigation and emotional factors have all been suggested to be associated with the occurrence and persistence of symptoms, but correlations are inconsistent.

A widely accepted hypothesis for an organic origin of the post-concussion syndrome postulates that the symptoms are due to microstructural white matter damage as a result of straining, stretching, deforming or even shearing forces, which is not detectable with conventional neuroimaging. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by findings from single photon emission computed tomography and perfusion CT, showing hypoperfusion in the frontal and parietal lobes of minor head injury patients in general, and magnetisation transfer imaging, showing a global reduction of the magnetic transfer ratio in minor head injury patients with post-concussive symptoms. Recent work in minor head injury patients shows disruption of saccadic eye movements, indicative of damage to midbrain pathways, and differences in event-related brain potentials, indicating disrupted speed of processing and connectivity, implicating white matter dysfunction. Further support is provided by a positive correlation between post-concussive symptoms and serum concentrations of protein S100-b, which is found in high concentrations in glial cells and Schwann cells and is highly specific for lesions of the central nervous system.

### Rapid brain MRI protocols reduce head computerized tomography use in the pediatric emergency department [^b67414ae]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols may be effective in the emergency department (ED) to evaluate nontraumatic neurologic complaints. We evaluate neuroimaging (rapid MRI [rMRI]), head computerized tomography [HCT], and full MRI) use following widespread implementation of rMRI protocols in a pediatric emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care pediatric ED of encounters with neuroimaging during two 9-month periods: one prior to (control period) and one after generalized availability of 4 rMRI protocols (rMRI period). The primary outcome was differences in neuroimaging rates between the two periods. Secondary outcomes included ED process measures, unsuccessful imaging, and undetected pathology, with full MRI within 14 days as the reference standard.

Results

There were 1052 encounters with neuroimaging during the control and 1308 during the rMRI periods. Differences in neuroimaging between periods were 27.7% for rMRI (95% CI, 24.4, 31.0), − 21.5% for HCT (95% CI, − 25.5, − 17.5), and − 6.2% for full MRI (95% CI, − 9.3, − 3.1%.) Time to imaging (182 [IQR 138–255] versus 86 [IQR 52–137] minutes) as well as ED length of stay (396 [IQR 304–484] versus 257 [IQR 196–334] minutes) was longer for rMRI versus HCT (p < 0.01). Between the control and rMRI periods, there were differences in types of neuroimaging performed for patients with altered mental status, headache, seizure, shunt dysfunction, stroke, syncope, trauma, vomiting, infection, and other neurologic complaints (p < 0.05). rMRI studies were unsuccessful in 3.6% of studies versus 0.0% of HCTs (p < 0.01). The 22 unsuccessful rMRI studies were unsuccessful due to artifacts from dental hardware (n = 2) and patient motion (n = 20). None of the rMRI studies with full MRI follow-up imaging had undetected pathology; the false negative rate for the HCT exams was as high as 25%.

Conclusions

After routine ED use of 4 rMRI protocols, there was a more than 20% decrease in HCT use without missed diagnoses. Time to neuroimaging and length of stay were longer for rMRI than HCT, with higher rates of unsuccessful imaging. Despite these limitations, rMRI may be an alternative to HCT for nontraumatic complaints in the ED.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAtaxia [^7f829b19]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ataxia can result from an abnormality in the cerebellum, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and/or vestibular system. Pathology involving the brain, such as infarct or hydrocephalus, can also present with ataxia as part of the symptom constitution, or result in symptoms that mimic ataxia. Clinical evaluation by history and careful neurological examination is important to help with lesion localization, and helps determine where imaging should be focused. In the setting of trauma with the area of suspicion in the brain, a head CT without intravenous contrast is the preferred initial imaging choice. If vascular injury is suspected, CTA of the neck can be helpful. When the area of suspicion is in the spine, CT or MRI of the spine can be considered to assess for bony or soft-tissue injury, respectively. In the setting of ataxia unrelated to recent trauma, MRI is the preferred imaging modality, tailored to assess the brain or spine depending on the area of suspected pathology. The use of intravenous contrast is generally helpful. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^b72a01c8]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) severity and imaging correlation — PDPH can be classified as mild, moderate and severe based on the amount of rest and physical activity per day and associated auditory and vestibular symptoms. Atypical presentation of PDPH has been increasingly recognized. In selected contexts, extensive CSF leak on MRI and MRI scores correlate with the severity of PDPH symptoms.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^15cfc773]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with mild head trauma will have no intracranial pathology and can be safely discharged home. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of these patients will have clinically significant findings on computed tomography imaging and up to 1% may require neurosurgical intervention. The revised Scandinavian Head Trauma Guidelines provide an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to assist physicians in determining which patients presenting with minimal, mild or moderate blunt head injury are at higher risk for intracranial pathology and thus require neuroimaging and hospital admission. Striking a balance between health care costs and risk of morbidity remains an ongoing challenge and we will present our concerns with this useful, but conservative management algorithm.

### Redefining migraine phases-a suggestion based on clinical, physiological, and functional imaging evidence [^7a9dfe7f]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Article highlights

The definition of the preictal and postictal phase varies between studies.
Based on the clinical, physiological, and imaging evidence, the current definition of the preictal phase, up to 48 hours before the head pain onset, is sufficient.
Based on the aforementioned evidence, we propose a renewed definition of the postictal phase, which lasts up to 24 hours after the end of the ictal phase; that is, the headache phase.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^6bb9e528]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) — additional concerns in suspected SAH include incidental aneurysm detection because 2% of the general population has asymptomatic cerebral aneurysms at baseline, with one approach being lumbar puncture (LP) for all patients with positive CTA results; radiation exposure increases since a cranial computed tomography (CT) dose is approximately 2 mSv and adding a CTA to a CT would at least double this exposure, and head and neck CT may increase cataract risk; after a negative noncontrast head CT, 302 patients who underwent LP had a 10.6% incidence of alternative diagnoses including viral meningitis (6.3%), intracranial hypertension (2.0%), bacterial meningitis (1.7%), chemical meningitis (0.3%), and intrathecal hematoma (0.3%), and broader availability may lead to increased CTA use because many patients otherwise do not have additional testing.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: a cause of severe acute headache [^c2c7c9f0]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Severe acute headache is a common presenting symptom to an accident and emergency department. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an increasingly recognised cause of these symptoms and has characteristic clinical and imaging findings. SIH is characterised by headache worse on standing, low opening cerebrospinal fluid pressures at lumbar puncture and uniform pachymeningeal enhancement with gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, all in the absence of dural trauma. Atypical presentations occur and severe neurological decline can rarely be associated with this condition. A review of five patients presenting recently to our institution with classical imaging findings together with a review of the literature is presented.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® horner syndrome [^4d3ae5b5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Horner syndrome is a combination of signs and symptoms caused by abnormalities in the oculosympathetic pathway. Typically, patients present with ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. Imaging the oculosympathetic pathway is complex because of its extensive course, need for targeted protocols, and the wide range of pathology that can cause it. For this document, we focus our attention on workup guidelines based on clinical features: 1) acuity (acute, nonacute including chronic, insidious, and unknown onset), 2) painless or painful (neck pain, occipital region pain, or headaches), 3) whether there is a history of trauma (any form of injury to the chest, neck, or head area, including iatrogenic injury from recent procedure and surgery), and 4) absence or presence of localizing brain, cranial nerve, or spinal cord neurological signs or symptoms. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Table 1
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendation

Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include evidence quality, risk/benefit aspects of presumed patient-important outcomes, costs and uncertainty concerning values and preferences.

Recommendations, relating to the clinical questions, were classed as strong (we recommend.), weak (we suggest.) or uncertain (we cannot recommend.) (see Table 1). For this process, careful consideration was again made to risk/benefit aspects of patient-important outcomes (need for neurosurgery was classed as the most important) in relation to test results, including assumptions for pretest probabilities (different magnitudes of risk for a positive reference result of CT, ICI or neurosurgery) for different patients, quality of evidence, uncertainty of the preferences and values for outcomes and the use of health care resources. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to achieve a strong recommendation despite low quality evidence or vice versa.

### Diagnostic yield of emergency MRI in non-traumatic headache [^71a6ac36]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our most common headache-related findings were similar to those reported by Budweg et al; in both studies, findings such as signs of intracranial hypertension, meningitis, and cerebral infarction were prevalent. Moreover, our data showed various, less common causes that were not met in the previous smaller sample, including Chiari 1 malformation, arterial dissection and occlusion, PRES and signs of intracranial hypotension. When compared to the previous studies using CT for acute headaches, they reported similar prevalences of cerebrovascular conditions (intracranial hemorrhages and ischemia) and newly detected neoplasms, but a lower prevalence of conditions that are more identifiable by MRI (such as infectious diseases and intracranial hypertension). We found recent infarcts (identified with DWI) in 30 patients (4% of all, 22% of those with significant findings). Most of these infarcts were small and often punctate. None of the patients had motor loss, and the prevalence of numbness was not higher than among other patients with significant findings. These small infarcts thus were unlikely to cause major neurological deficits, which are usually primarily imaged with CT anyway. In fact, a third of these patients had previous CT scans, all with unremarkable findings.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^ade01a7c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Practice Guideline — red flags and imaging for suspected secondary headache states that features of a secondary headache that warrant prompt attention include "thunderclap" headache, rapid onset, high blood pressure, visual changes, neurologic deficits or altered consciousness, vomiting, and fever. Timely imaging is important for detecting the appropriate treatment and preventing the possible development of neurologic deficits, particularly in patients with an uncertain diagnosis, and in more than 25% of pregnant women presenting with acute headache, brain imaging may reveal a secondary etiology. When it is determined that imaging for secondary causes of headache is warranted, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be appropriate as dictated by clinical suspicion of underlying etiology, as well as availability of imaging resources, and magnetic resonance imaging is often the preferred imaging modality during pregnancy, and the use of radiation and contrast should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.

### Acute headache in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^6ae08db9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Unilateral location Pulsatile pain Moderate to severe intensity Exacerbated with activity|Unilateral Severe orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain And 1 or more of the following ipsilateral features: Conjunctival erythema or lacrimation Rhinorrhea Forehead or facial diaphoresis Upper eyelid ptosis or constricted pupil|. A migraine may present with or without aura. An aura is a reversible visual, sensory, or speech disturbance that precedes the headache and can last five to 60 minutes. Visual aura is the most common type of aura. Visual changes associated with migraine headache tend to be gradual and in a shimmering or zigzagging pattern as opposed to visual changes associated with a transient ischemic attack, which is a more abrupt visual loss without shimmering lights or a zigzag pattern.

The POUND mnemonic and the ID Migraine rule are clinical decision rules that can help diagnose migraine in primary care 16–18. The POUND mnemonic uses five clinical features that were identified as the best independent predictors of migraine. 19 Headaches with at least four POUND clinical features are most likely to be a migraine. 16 The three-item ID Migraine rule asks about the presence of light sensitivity, nausea or vomiting, and activity-limiting headache during the past three months to determine the likelihood of a migraine diagnosis. 18 Patients who experienced two or more items are considered to have a positive screening result.
18. TRIGEMINAL AUTONOMIC CEPHALALGIAS Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias are uncommon.

Patients with this type of headache may benefit from a consultation with and comanagement by a neurologist because of their relatively infrequent occurrence. Subtypes of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks.

Predictors of exacerbation of headache in the MTBI group

Female sex (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.35–4.72) and pathological imaging findings on CT or MRI (OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.16–7.15) were significant positive predictors for acute HAIH, but this was no longer the case for persistent HAIH (Table 6). Significant positive predictors for persistent HAIH were prior MTBI (OR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.28–6.53) and being injured under the influence of alcohol (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.04–4.09). Age, socioeconomic status, duration of PTA, and GCS score were not significant predictors of acute or persistent HAIH. In a follow-up analysis for persistent HAIH, we also included "having acute HAIH" in the regression model. This variable was highly significantly associated with persistent HAIH (OR: 5.63; 95% CI: 2.54–12.50) (not shown in table).

### Making decisions about radiological imaging in pregnancy [^63d51fb2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Headache

A 35 year old woman attends an out-of-hours GP service with headache and vomiting that started suddenly, 24 hours earlier. She is 17 weeks pregnant and has no headache history. She has diplopia but no fever or meningism. Vital observations and urine dipstick are unremarkable. The GP recommends urgent assessment in the emergency department and advises that this will likely include imaging. The patient wishes to discuss imaging options.

Headache in pregnancy is common and usually the result of primary headache disorders (eg, tension headache or migraine).

After 20 weeks' gestation, pre-eclampsia is also a common cause and associated with hypertension with or without proteinuria.

Consider urgent radiological investigations if there is clinical suspicion of a life threatening diagnosis (eg, subarachnoid haemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis).

CT is quick, widely available, can readily detect acute haemorrhage, and post contrast imaging is possible. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting most intracranial pathology; however, it is slower, less readily available, more prone to artefact, and post contrast imaging (using gadolinium) is generally not recommended in pregnancy(table 1).

If CT is clinically indicated and would be the usual first choice in a non-pregnant patient, the authors recommend not delaying CT (ie, avoid considering MRI as first line purely on the basis of fetal risk).

Advise the patient that the radiation dose to the fetus from CT scanning of the head is negligible (table 2).

If CT is negative, further investigation with MRI, post contrast CT, or lumbar puncture may be required, depending on the suspected diagnosis.

### Neuroimaging for neurovascular complications of traumatic brain injury [^a23af534]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

However, all in it, these findings shed the light on a different scenario where trauma patients with multiple systems injuries and at risk of hemorrhagic complications might be inappropriately treated with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies.

In these instances, DSA might be considered to confirm CTA findings.

Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR-Angiography (MRA) are less frequently acquired in the emergency setting due to the concern for metallic foreign bodies related to trauma, longer acquisition times and sensitivity to motion artifacts. Despite these limitations, MRI can improve diagnosis of BCVI. For instance, in low-grade lesions with equivocal BCVI on CTA, MRI with vessel wall imaging allowing for direct visualization of arterial wall might improve diagnostic accuracy of BCVI.

When to image

The increasing adoption of screening criteria and a more strict neurological evaluation especially in critical care has improved the detection of BCVI, with a concomitant reduction of BCVI-related ischemic stroke and mortality over the last three decades. In particular, the occurrence of stroke has consistently decreased over the years from 37% to about 4,8% of patients with BCVI.

A collaborative approach of neurointensivists and neuroradiologists should help in recognizing the instances which require to proceed with CTA in a trauma patient after a plain CT head.

The European Society of Emergency Radiology guidelines on radiological polytrauma imaging state that the neck region should be included in the whole body tomography scan with intravenous contrast medium in such a way that the neck arteries and brain base arteries are well opacified.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^7b4ed228]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

MRI — head and spine in suspected intentional injury describes use, sequences, and spine considerations. MRI of the head is typically used in the nonemergent setting if a continued suspicion of head injury exists when a head CT is negative, and is also used to assess the extent of post-traumatic injury seen on CT; T1- and T2-weighted, T2 fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2✱, and diffusion-weighted sequences provide increased sensitivity for parenchymal ischemia, diffuse axonal injury, microhemorrhage, and small extra-axial hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced sequences can help identify extra-axial collections and septations that suggest a chronic component, and unenhanced time-of-flight magnetic resonance venograms can assess the dural venous sinuses for patency when occlusive thrombosis is a concern. C-spine injuries are common in the setting of intentional head trauma, and the ACR recommends that clinicians consider performing an MRI of the C-spine at the time of brain MRI; an MRI of the thoracolumbar spine is not included in the routine imaging work-up, but when concern exists about a potential spinal cord injury, the MRI can help distinguish between unintentional and intentional injury by identifying subdural blood, which is a more common finding with intentional injury.

### Carotid artery dissection presenting with isolated headache and horner syndrome after minor head injury [^84ebe7fb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A woman aged 31 years presented to the emergency department after a minor head injury. She reported mild headache and a metallic taste in her mouth. Full neurologic examination was remarkable only for left-sided Horner syndrome. Left internal carotid artery dissection was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. She was treated with aspirin. Symptoms and signs persisted 3 months later, but there was no additional neurologic deficit. We stress the importance of early detection of Horner syndrome to minimize the risk of disabling stroke.
