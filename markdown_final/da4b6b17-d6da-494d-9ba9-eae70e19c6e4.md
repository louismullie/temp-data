## Question

MAC symptoms in HIV

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of MAC in HIV, including how they differ by immune status, organ involvement, and timing relative to ART, as well as how to distinguish them from similar conditions and complications like IRIS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and immune context that shape the symptom pattern. Then, I should verify the core constitutional and organ-specific manifestations in advanced HIV. Next, I will examine how the presentation diverges in patients on suppressive ART, including localized disease and IRIS. After that, I need to check pediatric nuances. Finally, I will integrate laboratory and imaging correlates and synthesize a practical, symptom-based framework for clinicians, making sure I cross-check each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic and immunologic context because symptom risk and patterns hinge on CD4 count and ART status. Disseminated MAC classically occurs with profound immunosuppression, typically CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3, and was historically very common in the pre-ART era, with incidence dropping dramatically after widespread ART, though it persists in those with advanced HIV disease and in late presenters, which explains why symptoms often reflect multi-organ involvement in severely immunocompromised hosts [^116YZFE3] [^1154fGHb].

> I will now examine the core constitutional syndrome in advanced HIV without effective ART, since that anchors recognition. Wait, let me verify the canonical symptom set: fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and malaise are consistently described, and importantly, these symptoms can precede mycobacteremia or positive cultures by weeks, which means early disease can be clinically suspected even before microbiologic confirmation, so I should emphasize that temporal relationship to avoid premature anchoring on negative cultures early on [^112gaiTn] [^112iTRdc].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal manifestations because MAC disseminates via the GI tract and often seeds mesenteric nodes and liver. Diarrhea and abdominal pain are common, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be present, and laboratory clues include anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase, which together with constitutional symptoms should raise suspicion for disseminated MAC in the right immunologic context, so I need to ensure I flag these as high-yield bedside signals [^112gaiTn] [^112iTRdc].

> Hold on, I should verify lymphatic and hepatic-splenic involvement more explicitly. Lymphadenopathy, including peripheral and intra-abdominal nodes, is frequently observed, and imaging may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, which aligns with the pathophysiology of hematogenous dissemination and reticuloendothelial organ seeding; this helps explain why exam and imaging can support the diagnosis even when cultures are pending [^112gaiTn] [^112iTRdc].

> But wait, what if the patient is on suppressive ART with immune recovery — does the symptom profile shift? Yes, localized MAC syndromes become relatively more prominent in ART-treated individuals with higher CD4 counts, including lymphadenitis, pulmonary disease, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, and even CNS disease; importantly, these localized presentations may be manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome rather than ongoing uncontrolled bacteremia, so I should double-check timing relative to ART initiation when symptoms flare [^112gaiTn] [^1126jYCF].

> I need to ensure I characterize MAC-IRIS accurately because it often masquerades as treatment failure. MAC-IRIS typically presents within 1 to 3 months after starting ART, with paradoxical worsening such as new or enlarging lymphadenitis, pulmonary infiltrates or nodules, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, and intra-abdominal disease; notably, mycobacteremia may be absent in IRIS, which is a key diagnostic clue that distinguishes inflammatory immune recovery from active disseminated infection, so I should confirm ART timing and inflammatory markers when symptoms escalate despite improving CD4 counts [^1126jYCF] [^112iTRdc].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific nuances so I don't overgeneralize adult patterns. In children with HIV, respiratory symptoms are uncommon in disseminated MAC, and isolated pulmonary disease is rare; instead, persistent or recurrent fever, weight loss or failure to thrive, sweats, fatigue, and persistent diarrhea predominate, and early symptoms can precede mycobacteremia by weeks, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in children with advanced HIV and nonspecific GI and constitutional complaints [^116pgyrk] [^115GHXMX].

> Next, I should review laboratory and imaging correlates that support the clinical picture. Anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase are common laboratory abnormalities in disseminated MAC, and imaging may show hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. However, I need to remember that bone marrow culture yield is not clearly superior to blood culture and that blood cultures remain the cornerstone diagnostic test, so I should not overinterpret a negative marrow if blood cultures are positive or clinical suspicion is high [^112gaiTn] [^116Zkn8F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any isolated respiratory or GI isolate equaling disease. Detection of MAC in respiratory or GI specimens may represent colonization and can even precede dissemination, so I should confirm disease with cultures from sterile sites, especially blood, before labeling symptoms as MAC-related; this prevents misattribution of nonspecific symptoms to MAC when another OI or process is actually responsible [^116Zkn8F] [^117NfC5j].

> Let me synthesize a practical symptom-based framework while keeping the immune context front and center. In patients with CD4 less than 50 cells/mm3 and not on effective ART, a constellation of fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, should prompt urgent evaluation for disseminated MAC with blood cultures and targeted imaging. In contrast, in patients on suppressive ART with rising CD4 counts, new focal symptoms such as painful lymphadenitis, localized bone pain, pericarditis, or skin lesions within weeks of ART initiation should trigger consideration of MAC-IRIS and careful exclusion of alternative diagnoses, with management tailored to severity and inflammatory burden [^112gaiTn] [^1126jYCF].

> Finally, I should double-check that I've integrated the key differentiators and timing signals. Early nonspecific constitutional and GI symptoms can precede positive cultures, localized syndromes dominate in ART-treated patients, and paradoxical worsening 1 to 3 months after ART points toward IRIS. Maintaining awareness of these patterns, alongside judicious use of blood cultures and imaging, helps align symptom interpretation with the correct pathophysiology and avoids delays in appropriate therapy or unnecessary escalation [^112gaiTn] [^1126jYCF] [^116Zkn8F].

---

MAC infection in people with HIV typically presents with **fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and diarrhea** [^112gaiTn], reflecting disseminated disease in advanced immunosuppression (CD4 < 50 cells/mm³) [^116YZFE3]. Abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common, and laboratory findings often include anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase [^112gaiTn]. Respiratory symptoms are less frequent but can occur, especially with localized pulmonary disease or IRIS [^112iTRdc]. Symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with other opportunistic infections, so **definitive diagnosis requires culture from blood or sterile sites** [^116Zkn8F].

---

## Constitutional symptoms

Constitutional symptoms are the hallmark of disseminated MAC and include **persistent fever and night sweats** — often prolonged and refractory to antibiotics — as well as **weight loss and cachexia** from chronic infection and malabsorption. Fatigue and malaise reflect systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation [^112gaiTn].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

MAC frequently involves the gastrointestinal tract, causing:

- **Diarrhea**: Chronic, watery, and sometimes steatorrheic, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance [^notfound].

- **Abdominal pain**: Nonspecific, diffuse, or localized, often related to mesenteric lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly [^notfound].

- **Malabsorption**: Nutrient loss and weight loss due to intestinal involvement [^notfound].

---

## Hepatic and splenic involvement

Hepatosplenomegaly is common due to **organ infiltration** by MAC, and **elevated alkaline phosphatase** reflects cholestasis and hepatic involvement [^112gaiTn].

---

## Hematologic abnormalities

Anemia is common, typically **normocytic and normochromic**, reflecting chronic infection and bone marrow involvement [^112gaiTn].

---

## Respiratory symptoms

Respiratory symptoms are less common in disseminated MAC but may occur with localized pulmonary disease or IRIS [^112gaiTn] [^115GHXMX]. Manifestations include **cough and dyspnea**, which are more frequent in localized pulmonary MAC or IRIS, and **chest pain**, which may occur with pulmonary involvement or IRIS [^114Z35ZL] [^1165f87t] [^112gaiTn].

---

## Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)

IRIS is a paradoxical worsening of symptoms after ART initiation, typically within weeks to months, and presents with **lymphadenopathy** — often painful, suppurative, and localized — as well as **pulmonary symptoms** such as cough, dyspnea, and radiographic infiltrates or nodules [^1126jYCF].

---

## Pediatric considerations

Children with HIV and MAC infection may present differently, with **failure to thrive** — poor growth and developmental delay — and **chronic diarrhea** that is persistent and associated with malabsorption [^116pgyrk].

---

## Summary of MAC symptoms in HIV

| **Symptom category** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Constitutional | - Fever <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Fatigue |

MAC infection in HIV presents with **nonspecific constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms**, especially in advanced immunosuppression [^112gaiTn]. Respiratory symptoms are less common but can occur with localized disease or IRIS [^112iTRdc]. Diagnosis requires culture confirmation due to symptom overlap with other opportunistic infections [^116Zkn8F].

### Prognostic factors of 634 HIV-negative patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease [^113BBtq7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

The prognostic factors of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD) are not clearly defined.

Objectives

To assess the prognostic factors of all-cause and MAC-specific mortality in patients with MAC-LD, especially in accordance with radiographic features, first-line treatment, and host predisposition.

Methods

Medical records of 634 HIV-negative patients with MAC-LD treated at our institution in Saitama, Japan were retrospectively analyzed.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients' mean age was 68.9 years, and median follow-up period was 4.7 years. Radiographic features included nodular/bronchiectatic (NB) disease: 482 patients (76.0%); fibrocavitary (FC) disease: 105 patients (16.6%); FC+NB disease: 30 patients (4.7%); and other types: 17 patients (3.0%). First-line treatments were observation or one drug: 479 patients (75.6%); 2 to 5 drugs: 131 patients (20.7%); and unknown: 24 patients (3.8%). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed male sex, older age, presence of systemic and/or respiratory comorbidity, non-NB radiographic features, body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m(2), anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 50 mm/h to be negative prognostic factors for all-cause mortality, and FC or FC+NB radiographic features, BMI less than 18.5 kg/m(2), anemia, and C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dl to be negative prognostic factors for MAC-specific mortality.

Conclusions

The first-line treatment regimen was not associated with all-cause mortality. FC or FC+NB disease, BMI less than 18.5 kg/m(2), and anemia were negative prognostic factors for both all-cause and MAC-specific mortality.

We report 4 cases of isolated pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and review the 20 previously reported cases in the human immunodeficiency virus literature. All 4 patients had acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and 3 were believed to have had an immune reconstitution syndrome as a cause of MAC infection. Two patients underwent bronchoscopy with biopsy, revealing endobronchial lesions and granuloma formation, and all 4 patients responded well to MAC therapy.

### An unusual cause of chest pain: Mycobacterium avium complex and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^111ctXsB]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome usually manifests as new infections or worsening of pre-existing infections during the first few months of initiating anti-retroviral therapy. It is commonly associated with local or systemic inflammation, presumably due to rapid reconstitution of host immune system. Here we describe a unique case of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome presenting as acute pericarditis and pericardial effusion caused by mycobacterium avium complex. We also demonstrate that judicious use of steroids, along with pathogen specific antimicrobial therapy, can prevent local complications of the inflammatory response.

### ' "Why me, why now? " using clinical immunology and epidemiology to explain who gets nontuberculous mycobacterial infection [^114kKhn1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacteria have historically been seen as environmental organisms of limited clinical relevance, overshadowed by their more aggressive cousin, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was not until the HIV pandemic highlighted disseminated Mycobacterium avium and intracellulare as major opportunistic infection syndromes that their significance was recognised by the general healthcare community, a role further cemented by the expansion of iatrogenic immunosuppression. Evidence to support an ongoing rise in disseminated NTM infection is limited. This is not the case for chronic pulmonary NTM disease which is increasing in part due to an aging, vulnerable population.

NTM are regarded generally as low pathogenicity organisms, which can be transiently isolated from samples such as sputum, colonise body sites such as the lung, or cause persistent infection and disease. Distinguishing between these different clinical states can be surprisingly difficult. However, it is important to do as this underpins both clinical management decisions and predicts outcome. An accepted approach is to define NTM-associated pulmonary disease as that in which compatible clinical features occur in people from whom NTM are repeatedly isolated over time. Treatment can be poorly tolerated and is certainly less effective than that for tuberculosis (TB). Hence an understanding of who is at risk enables us to both target interventions and potentially prevent disease occurring.

Research into monogenic disorders conferring susceptibility to disseminated NTM infection provides key insights into the critical host immune responses against these organisms, though many questions remain: in particular why such a large population of apparently immunocompetent people become infected and develop pulmonary disease.

We present here a summary of how specific conditions and iatrogenic interventions have elucidated both the essential and redundant components of human defences against NTM. We use this to suggest practical strategies for investigation in patients presenting with these infections.

### How do I manage disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease in people with HIV? [^117DbkGs]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Advanced HIV disease (AHD) is increasing, with late presentation accounting for half of newly diagnosed people with HIV (PWH) in Europe. Mortality in late-presenting PWH remains high, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, among other opportunistic infections, presents several diagnostic and treatment challenges that lead, ultimately, to a poor clinical outcome.

Objectives

We aimed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of disseminated MAC disease (dMACd) in PWH.

Sources

We performed a review of original articles, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed.

Content

We reviewed and discussed the most challenging steps in the management of PWH with AHD and dMACd: the current epidemiology in the era of effective antiretroviral treatment; clinical presentation and interpretation of symptoms in the context of other opportunistic infections and immune reconstitution; diagnosis, sampling, and timing to reach a definitive diagnosis; prophylaxis, treatment options, and indications for discontinuing MAC treatment; future perspectives; and the role of rifamycins in the treatment of dMACd.

Implications

Despite the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral treatment, dMACd still represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in PWH with AHD. Residual challenges are mainly related to the difficulties and timing required to reach a definitive diagnosis, and the discussion regarding the role of rifamycins in the treatment of dMACd is still open.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — epidemiology and risk factors in people with HIV include that, prior to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), M. avium was the etiologic agent in > 95% of disseminated cases, and an estimated 7% to 12% of adults have previously contracted MAC, with no environmental exposure or behavior consistently linked to subsequent risk. Transmission is thought to occur via inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation through the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract; household or close contacts do not appear to be at increased risk, and person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Disease typically occurs with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 50 cells/mm3, with incidence of disseminated disease of 20% to 40% in advanced immunosuppression without effective ART or chemoprophylaxis; in the modern ART era, incidence has declined to < 2 cases of MAC as the first opportunistic infection (OI) per 1,000 person-years for individuals in care. Additional risk factors include plasma HIV RNA levels > 1,000 copies/mL, ongoing viral replication despite ART, previous or concurrent OIs, and reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to M. avium antigens.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117MS1cV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in children with HIV — diagnosis is established by culture, with MAC definitively diagnosed by isolation of the organism from blood or sterile-site biopsy, and blood cultures being sensitive and minimally invasive as > 90% of individuals with disseminated MAC have positive blood cultures. Multiple mycobacterial blood cultures over time may be required, greater blood volume increases yield, and use of a radiometric broth medium or lysis-centrifugation culture technique can enhance recovery from blood. After growth, MAC isolates can be identified by nucleic acid probes or by high-performance liquid chromatography of mycolic acid patterns, though availability of the latter may be limited to high volume laboratories. Histology showing macrophage-containing acid-fast bacilli is strongly indicative, but culture is essential to differentiate nontuberculous mycobacteria from M. tuberculosis, determine the infecting nontuberculous mycobacterium, and perform drug-susceptibility testing; susceptibility testing to clarithromycin or azithromycin is most useful because clinical response correlates with macrolide susceptibility. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction platforms for rapid identification and susceptibility testing are currently only available in research laboratories, and detection of MAC in stool or the respiratory tract does not have evidence that initiating prophylaxis at these sites reduces risk of disseminated MAC.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) diagnosis in children with HIV uses the same procedures as in adults, and MAC is definitively diagnosed by isolation of the organism from blood or from biopsy specimens from normally sterile sites. Blood cultures are a sensitive and minimally invasive technique, as > 90% of individuals in whom MAC is diagnosed have positive blood cultures, and multiple mycobacterial blood cultures over time may be required to yield a positive result. Yield is influenced by blood volume, radiometric broth medium or lysis-centrifugation can enhance recovery, nucleic acid probes for MAC are commercially available, and high-performance liquid chromatography may only be available at high volume laboratories. Histology showing macrophage-containing acid-fast bacilli is strongly indicative but culture is essential; testing for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is most useful, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing platforms are currently only available in research laboratories.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome in HIV-infected patients: spectrum of disease and long-term follow-up [^116cbFs8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term outcome and spectrum of disease of nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome have not been described.

Methods

We report the findings of an observational study.

Results

Among 51 patients (43 with Mycobacterium avium complex [MAC] infection, 2 with Mycobacterium genavense infection, and 6 whose samples were smear positive but culture negative) from 1993–2004, the median follow-up period was 29 months. The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome was 3.5% among patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a baseline CD4+ cell count of < 100 cells/microL. Three main clinical presentations were peripheral lymphadenitis (in 17 patients), pulmonary-thoracic disease (in 15 patients), and intra-abdominal disease (in 13 patients). Six other patients had cases that involved joint, spine, prostate, skin, soft tissue, and spontaneously resolving MAC bacteremia. Disease was usually localized. Median CD4+ cell counts before initiation of HAART and at diagnosis were 20 and 120 cells/microL, respectively, and the median reduction in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load was 2.5 log10 copies/mL. Intra-abdominal disease was frequently preceded by disseminated MAC infection (in 62% of cases, compared with 6%-33% of cases for other groups; p = 0.003) and accounted for 16 (43%) of 36 hospitalizations (compared with 5%-35% for other groups; p = 0.008). The relapse rate was not higher among 10 patients who received no MAC therapy or received MAC therapy for ≤ 2 weeks. Prednisone was associated with clinical responses in 8 (89%) of 9 patients with evaluable cases. In total, 7 patients (14%) had 13 subsequent culture-positive MAC events (6 of which were cases of immune reconstitution syndrome, and 7 of which were cases of disseminated MAC infection). Ten patients (20%) died (2 of disseminated MAC infection, 5 of other opportunistic infections, and 3 of HIV-unrelated causes).

Conclusions

Nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome has a wide range of clinical presentations and severity. The long-term prognosis is favorable for HAART-adherent patients. Intra-abdominal disease is associated with greater morbidity than is peripheral lymphadenitis. The role of antimycobacterial therapy is uncertain, given the self-limited course of most nonabdominal cases.

### An association between pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infections and biomarkers of Th2-type inflammation [^114XZwGq]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection is rising, and this appears to be driven largely by an increase in pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAI) infection. Pulmonary NTM disease is characterized by respiratory and constitutional symptoms, with significant impact on quality of life. Treatment requires long-courses of antibiotics, which often do not eradicate the mycobacteria. Furthermore, many of the antimicrobials used to treat NTM disease have significant adverse-effects and drug-drug interactions. As a result, often the benefit of attempting to treat localized infection is outweighed by its complications - leaving patients with persistent symptoms. Investigating the aetiology of pulmonary NTM infections may therefore enable us to devise more effective treatments and so manage the increasing number of affected individuals.

Whilst disseminated NTM infections are associated with severe immunodeficiency states such as HIV infection or defects in interferon gamma (IFNγ) and STAT3 pathways, the pathophysiology of localised pulmonary NTM infection is unclear. Pulmonary NTM disease is most often seen in patients with chronic respiratory illness but this is perhaps confounded by doctors most often testing for NTM in such populations. Research in patients with cystic fibrosis demonstrates a specific association between NTM infection and allergic-bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) - suggesting that the increased predilection for NTM infections in patients with chronic lung disease is more complex than simply mycobacteria thriving in damaged lungs.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who are not previously ART treated or are not receiving effective ART initiation, ART generally should be withheld until after the first 2 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy have been completed to reduce drug interaction and IRIS risks and to lower pill burden (weak, very low).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prevention in children with HIV notes that MAC is ubiquitous, available information does not support specific recommendations regarding exposure avoidance, and person-to-person transmission is not believed to be common. Although detection of MAC in stool or the respiratory tract may precede disseminated disease, no data demonstrate a correlation between initiating prophylaxis at those sites and reduced risk of disseminated MAC. The most effective way to prevent disseminated MAC in children with HIV infection is to preserve immune function through use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Children with HIV infection who have advanced immunosuppression should be offered prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease according to the CD4 count thresholds for children, and before prophylaxis is initiated in at-risk children, disseminated MAC disease must be ruled out, which includes obtaining a blood culture for MAC.

### Sources of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection in AIDS [^111hBbr8]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the sources of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in AIDS.

Methods

HIV positive subjects with CD4 counts < 100/mm(3) in Atlanta, Boston, New Hampshire and Finland were entered in a prospective cohort study. Subjects were interviewed about potential MAC exposures, had phlebotomy performed for determination of antibody to mycobacterial lipoarabinomannin and for culture. Patient-directed water samples were collected from places of residence, work and recreation. Patients were followed for the development of disseminated MAC. Univariate and multivariate risk factors for MAC were analyzed.

Results

Disseminated MAC was identified in 31 (9%) subjects. Significant risks in univariate analysis included prior Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (hazard ratio 1.821), consumption of spring water (4.909), consumption of raw seafood (34.3), gastrointestinal endoscopy (2.894), and showering outside the home (0.388). PCP, showering and endoscopy remained significant in a Cox proportional hazards model. There was no association between M. avium colonization of home water and risk of MAC. In patients with CD4 < 25, median OD antibody levels to lipoarabinomannin at baseline were 0.054 among patients who did not develop MAC and 0.021 among patients who did develop MAC (P = 0.077).

Conclusions

MAC infection results from diverse and likely undetectable environmental and nosocomial exposures. Mycobacterial infection before HIV infection may confer protection against disseminated MAC in advanced AIDS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116YZFE3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — epidemiology in people with HIV is marked by environmental ubiquity of MAC organisms and typical occurrence with profound immunosuppression, with CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts < 50 cells/mm3. In the era before effective antiretroviral therapy, M. avium was the etiologic agent in > 95% of people with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who acquired disseminated MAC disease, and an estimated 7% to 12% of adults with HIV have been previously infected with MAC. Historically, the incidence of disseminated MAC disease ranged from 20% to 40% in people with advanced immunosuppression without effective ART or chemoprophylaxis, whereas in the modern ART era the overall incidence has declined to < 2 cases of MAC as the first opportunistic infection per 1,000 person-years for individuals in care, even among those not receiving effective ART. The mode of infection is thought to be through repeated inhalation or ingestion via the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract; household or close contacts do not appear to be at increased risk, and person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Beyond a CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3, factors associated with increased risk include ongoing HIV viral replication despite ART, previous or concurrent opportunistic infections, reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative immune responses to M. avium antigens, and genetic predisposition in some populations.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) epidemiology and rationale against primary prophylaxis — among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and not receiving MAC prophylaxis, the incidence of primary MAC disease was 0.74 per 1,000 person-years (IQ range 0.68 to 0.80). These data suggest that primary MAC prophylaxis provides no additional benefit in patients started on effective ART that results in viral suppression. Additional arguments against primary MAC prophylaxis include increased cost, adverse effects of prophylaxis drugs, and the risk that, in those who might develop "unmasking MAC IRIS" after starting ART, monotherapy for MAC prophylaxis may result in acquired drug resistance in those with active MAC disease.

We describe 3 patients who developed atypical manifestations of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection > 10 months (range, 3–16 months) after attaining sustained CD4(+) T cell counts of > 100 cells/microL while receiving antiretroviral therapy and not receiving MAC prophylaxis. The common features of these cases include the degree of immune reconstitution, the unusual locations of the infections, and the absence of a systemic inflammatory response. The low rate of these unusual MAC infections does not warrant continuation of primary or secondary prophylaxis after presumed immune reconstitution.

We present an instructive case of cervical lymphadenitis in a young man without a history of HIV infection. The patient developed spontaneous left-sided neck swelling that progressed over 4 months. CT imaging demonstrated a necrotic left-sided neck mass within the cervical lymph node chain. He was initially prescribed azithromycin and rifampin for presumed cat scratch disease with improvement but incomplete resolution of symptoms. Blood cultures ordered 2 months later grew Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and the patient had an excellent clinical response to MAC therapy. Here, we review the case, including presentation and management, and describe the implications for the immune status of the host and long-term considerations for treatment.

Preventing recurrence and stopping secondary prophylaxis in disseminated MAC — People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should continue chronic maintenance therapy (AII) unless ART results in immune reconstitution. The risk of MAC recurrence is low after at least a 12-month MAC treatment course when patients remain asymptomatic with respect to MAC signs and symptoms and sustain an increase in CD4 count to > 100 cells/mm3 for ≥ 6 months after initiation of ART; in this setting, it is reasonable to discontinue maintenance therapy (AI). Reintroducing chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis may be indicated for those without a fully suppressive ART regimen who have a decline in CD4 count to levels consistently below 100 cells/mm3 (BIII).

### A double-blind randomized study of aminoglycoside infusion with combined therapy for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease [^1135zSfD]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A prospective study of the clinical efficacy of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (streptomycin, SM) for the treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease was carried out. In a multicenter trial, patients with pulmonary MAC disease received protocol-guided combined chemotherapy with or without SM. SM was given to the patients intramuscularly 15 mg/kg three times per week for the initial 3 months and three other antibiotics (rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin) were added and administered for over 24 months after the conversion of MAC strains. From April 1998 to December 2004, 160 HIV-negative patients were enrolled in this trial. Fourteen patients were found to be ineligible because they could not continue the treatment, and they were excluded from the analysis after randomization. Seventy-three patients were assigned to receive combined chemotherapy with SM (group A) and 73 were assigned to receive combined chemotherapy without SM (group B). The median durations of treatment were 27.6 months in group A and 28.4 months in group B. The difference in the backgrounds of the groups was not statistically significant. There were no differences in microbiological and radiological findings between the groups, but the sputum conversion rate for pulmonary MAC disease at the completion of treatment was significantly higher in group A than that in group B. Although, there were no significant differences in the sputum relapse rate and clinical improvement including both clinical symptoms and radiological findings, group A showed better initial microbiological response than group B. As for adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory findings, there were no significant differences between the groups. Based on the results of this double-blind randomized study, we support treatment including SM according to both the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Japanese Society for Tuberculosis (JST) guidelines for patients with pulmonary MAC disease without HIV infection.

### Clinical and immunologic predictors of Mycobacterium avium complex immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in a contemporary cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus [^11238ijf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can present with new or worsening symptoms associated with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection shortly after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation as MAC immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (MAC-IRIS). In this study, we assessed the utility of several laboratory tests as predictors of MAC-IRIS.

Methods

People with HIV with clinical and histologic and/or microbiologic evidence of MAC-IRIS were identified and followed up to 96 weeks post-ART initiation within a prospective study of 206 ART-naive patients with CD4 < 100 cells/µL.

Results

Fifteen (7.3%) patients presented with MAC-IRIS within a median interval of 26 days after ART initiation. Patients who developed MAC-IRIS had lower body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and increased CD38 frequency and mean fluorescence intensity on CD8+ T cells at the time of ART initiation compared with non-MAC IRIS patients. A decision tree inference model revealed that stratifying patients based on levels of ALP and D-dimer could predict the likelihood of MAC-IRIS. A binary logistic regression demonstrated that higher levels of ALP at baseline were associated with increased risk of MAC-IRIS development.

Conclusions

High ALP levels and increased CD8+ T-cell activation with low CD4 counts at ART initiation should warrant suspicion for subsequent development of MAC-IRIS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116Zkn8F]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) diagnosis in HIV — A confirmed diagnosis of disseminated MAC disease is based on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with the isolation of MAC from cultures of blood, lymph fluid, bone marrow, or other normally sterile tissue or body fluids, although data suggest that bone marrow cultures have low yield for detection of MAC in this setting, particularly if blood cultures are negative. Species identification should be performed using molecular techniques, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, whole-genome sequencing, high-performance liquid chromatography, or biochemical tests. Other ancillary studies provide supportive diagnostic information, including acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of tissue, radiographic imaging, or other studies aimed at isolating organisms from focal infection sites. Although isolated pulmonary MAC disease is not often observed in people with advanced HIV-associated immunosuppression, occasionally MAC disease may be limited to the lung in people with HIV who are virologically suppressed on ART. Diagnostic criteria for disease limited to the lung in this setting should follow those established by the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA joint guideline, which include pulmonary clinical signs and symptoms, exclusion of other alternative diagnoses, nodular or cavitary disease on lung imaging, and a positive culture for MAC from at least two sputum specimens or at least one bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy sample. Detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract may represent colonization of these sites and may be a harbinger of disseminated MAC infection.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in HIV-infected persons most often causes disseminated disease, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium kansasii accounting for the majority of disseminated cases; disseminated MAC typically presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain with possible lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and/or splenomegaly, and diagnosis requires isolation of the organism from blood, lymph node, bone marrow, or other sterile sites; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs commonly with mycobacterial infections and MAC-IRIS most frequently presents with focal lymphadenitis, with other manifestations including pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue abscesses, and central nervous system involvement, with absence of mycobacteremia; treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prednisone for moderate to severe cases, and occasionally surgical drainage of affected nodes; M. kansasii is less common than TB or MAC, more often causes pulmonary than extrapulmonary/disseminated disease, and presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and weight loss with radiographic findings including alveolar and interstitial infiltrates, thin-walled cavities, nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — preventing recurrence in people with HIV and disseminated disease specifies a minimum treatment duration and CD4 thresholds tied to discontinuation of therapy. People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should be treated for a minimum duration of 12 months (AII), and the CD4 count should be maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months before discontinuing MAC treatment. If initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not result in immune reconstitution, people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should continue chronic maintenance therapy (AII).

### Complexity ofcomplex immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (MAC-IRIS) in a patient with HIV [^1165f87t]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of Mycobacterium avium complex immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (MAC-IRIS) in a patient with HIV positive. Initial presentation was that of a purpuric purple macular rash in-keeping with Kaposi sarcoma as an AIDS defining illness. Three weeks following the initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) she developed chest pain, dry cough and fever. A diagnosis of MAC was made through imaging and sputum cultures and appropriate treatment was initiated. Despite adequate management with evidence of good immunological and virological response, the patient represented with persistent symptoms. Repeat CT of the chest confirmed worsening lymphadenopathy with necrosis. Given these findings, a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS was made with resolution of fever after corticosteroids were initiated. This case highlights the importance of considering MAC as a cause of IRIS in severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV.

Pulmonary or localized organ MAC disease in people with HIV with higher CD4 counts and full ART suppression: Following the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines would be reasonable in such settings, with an initial three-drug regimen containing a macrolide and ethambutol for macrolide-susceptible pulmonary MAC disease and addition of an aminoglycoside, which in refractory cases can be given as inhalation suspension, if cavitary or severe bronchiectatic disease is present or if macrolide resistance is suspected. Injectable aminoglycosides should generally be avoided except in refractory disease when other alternative agents are not available or tolerated, and additional drugs with in vitro activity against clinical isolates of MAC include bedaquiline, tedizolid, linezolid, and omadacycline; these might also be considered in people with refractory MAC disease.

### Interventions for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex in adults and children with HIV [^113Q99HB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a common complication of advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease and is an independent predictor of mortality and shortened survival.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at preventing MAC infection in adults and children with HIV infection.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library (search date December 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different strategies for preventing MAC infection in HIV-infected individuals.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Where data were incomplete or unclear, a third reviewer resolved conflicts and/or trial authors were contacted for further details. Development of MAC infection and survival were compared using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials: There was no statistically significant difference between clofazimine and no treatment groups in the number of patients that developed MAC infection (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.80). Rifabutin (one study; RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), azithromycin (three studies; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.74) and clarithromycin (one study; RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.58) were more effective than placebo in preventing the development of MAC infection. There was no statistically significant difference between those treated with clofazimine (one study; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.32), rifabutin (one study RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.05), azithromycin (three studies, pooled RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32) and placebo in number of reported deaths. One study found that the risk of death was reduced by 22% in patients treated with clarithromycin compared to those treated with placebo (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96). Monotherapy vs. monotherapy: Patients treated with clarithromycin (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89) and azithromycin (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89) were 40% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin. There was no statistically significant difference between those treated with clarithromycin (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15), azithromycin (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24) and rifabutin in the number of reported deaths. Combination therapy versus monotherapy: There was no statistically significant difference between patients treated with a combination of rifabutin and clarithromycin and those treated with clarithromycin alone (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20); and those treated with combination of rifabutin and azithromycin and those treated with azithromycin alone (RR 0.59; 95% CI 1.03). Patients treated with a combination of rifabutin plus clarithromycin were 56% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin alone (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.69). Patients treated with a combination of rifabutin plus azithromycin were 65% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin alone (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.59). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of reported deaths in all the four different comparisons of prophylactic agents.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited data, azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be a prophylactic agent of choice for MAC infection. Further studies are needed, especially direct comparison of clarithromycin and azithromycin. In additions, studies that will compare different doses and regimens are needed.

### Emergence of disseminated infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in non-HIV-infected patients, including immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in a university hospital in Taiwan [^1163HgPX]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection has been increasingly reported in patients with AIDS, this condition is still considered rare in non-HIV-infected patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-HIV-infected patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1997 to December 2004 to search for epidemiological trends in disseminated NTM infection. Data analyzed included etiology, demographic characteristics, underlying disease, initial symptoms and signs, treatment, and outcomes.

Results

Disseminated NTM infections occurred in 15 non-HIV-infected patients during the study period. The mean age of these patients was 51 years (range 13–80). Among these patients, eight were males, and eight had various immunocompromised conditions. Fever was an initial presentation in 12 patients (80%). Diagnosis was made by positive blood (seven patients) or bone marrow culture (five patients) in the majority (73%) of patients. Infectious etiologies included Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in eight, rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) in four and Mycobacterium kansasii in three. The mean time from initial presentation to initiation of anti-NTM therapy was 130 days (ranged from 9 days to 17 months). Mortality was highest in patients with M. kansasii (100%), followed by RGM (25%) and MAC (12.5%).

Conclusions

Although disseminated NTM infection is an emerging condition among patients without HIV infection, it is a condition which is associated with immune deficiency. A high level of clinical suspicion should be maintained for avoiding delayed diagnosis, especially in patients with underlying immunosuppression. Blood culture might play an important role in the early diagnosis of disseminated NTM disease. Early diagnosis can lead to appropriate diagnosis and reduce mortality.

### Rifabutin [^112Q7y2e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Rifabutin capsules must not be administered for MAC prophylaxis to patients with active tuberculosis.

Patients who develop complaints consistent with active tuberculosis while on prophylaxis with rifabutin should be evaluated immediately, so that those with active disease may be given an effective combination regimen of anti-tuberculosis medications. Administration of rifabutin as a single agent to patients with active tuberculosis is likely to lead to the development of tuberculosis that is resistant both to rifabutin and to rifampin.

There is no evidence that rifabutin is an effective prophylaxis against M. tuberculosis. Patients requiring prophylaxis against both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex may be given isoniazid and rifabutin concurrently.

Tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients is common and may present with atypical or extrapulmonary findings. Patients are likely to have a nonreactive purified protein derivative (PPD) despite active disease. In addition to chest X-ray and sputum culture, the following studies may be useful in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the HIV-positive patient: blood culture, urine culture, or biopsy of a suspicious lymph node.

MAC Treatment with Clarithromycin

When rifabutin is used concomitantly with clarithromycin for MAC treatment, a decreased dose of rifabutin is recommended due to the increase in plasma concentrations of rifabutin (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Table 2).

Hypersensitivity and Related Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients receiving rifamycins. Signs and symptoms of these reactions may include hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, acute bronchospasm, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or flu-like syndrome (weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, chills, aches, rash, itching, sweats, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, syncope, palpitations). There have been reports of anaphylaxis with the use of rifamycins.

Monitor patients receiving rifabutin therapy for signs and/or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If these symptoms occur, administer supportive measures and discontinue rifabutin.

Uveitis

Due to the possible occurrence of uveitis, patients should also be carefully monitored when rifabutin is given in combination with clarithromycin (or other macrolides) and/or fluconazole and related compounds (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Table 2). If uveitis is suspected, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist and, if considered necessary, treatment with rifabutin should be suspended (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and culture in the evaluation of HIV-infected patients for invasive mycobacteria and histoplasma infections [^111xUEQU]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Bone marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy are used commonly in clinical practice to diagnose invasive tissue infections caused by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAC), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection. However, the value of these invasive procedures relative to other diagnostic approaches has not been clearly defined. To determine the value of BM culture and BM histology in the diagnosis of opportunistic MAC/TB and HC infections in immunosuppressed patients with HIV, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 56 adult patients with HIV who underwent a single BM aspiration, biopsy, and culture because of unexplained fever and/or other clinical features suggestive of MAC/TB or HC infection. Thirty-two patients (57%) were ultimately diagnosed with MAC/TB or HC infection by positive cultures of BM, blood, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or by the histologic detection of organisms in biopsies of BM or other tissues. The diagnostic sensitivity of BM cultures was equal to that of blood cultures (20/32, or 63%). Granuloma and/or histologically apparent organisms were seen in BM biopsy specimens in 11 of 32 individuals (34%) ultimately diagnosed with MAC/TB or HC infections. Among these 11 cases, both granuloma and acid-fast staining organisms were found in the BM biopsy specimens of 2 individuals for whom both BM and blood cultures were negative. Certain clinical symptoms and signs at the time of BM examination were found by logistic regression analysis to be significantly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of MAC/TB or HC infections; these included high fever, long duration of febrile days prior to BM examination, and elevated direct bilirubin. In conclusion, while the diagnostic sensitivity of BM cultures was found to be no greater than that of blood cultures in detecting MAC/TB or HC infections in immunosuppressed HIV+ patients, histopathologic examination of BM specimens resulted in the relatively rapid identification of nearly one third of infected patients who underwent BM examination, and also identified infections in some patients who were culture negative. These findings support the continued use of BM aspiration, biopsy, and culture for the diagnosis of opportunistic MAC/TB or HC infections in immunosuppressed HIV+ patients, particularly when selected clinical features are present.

### Association of adherence to Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy with clinical outcomes in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^1157Vgx6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

High-level adherence to regimens of combination antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications for opportunistic infections (OIs) is crucial to their success. However, little is known about the association between adherence to these life-sustaining therapies and such clinical outcomes as progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or development of OIs. We assessed adherence to regimens of antiretroviral and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylactic medications in 643 patients enrolled in a trial of MAC prophylaxis. By week 56 of the study follow-up, 42% of the patients reported nonadherence to MAC prophylaxis, whereas one-quarter of the patients reported nonadherence to potent antiretroviral regimens. Nonadherence to both MAC prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy was associated with higher human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA levels and a significant increase in the risk of developing an AIDS-defining complication or death. Predictors of nonadherence are presented. These results underscore the clinical significance of adherence to HIV therapy and may be helpful in designing interventions to optimize the management of HIV by improving adherence.

### Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria in patients without HIV infection, New York city [^112yZmkh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Although the pathogenic potential of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) was reported throughout the 20th century, widespread appreciation of the clinical syndromes caused by NTM began during the 1980s in association with the AIDS pandemic and the consequent dramatic increase in disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. However, the epidemiology of NTM disease in patients without HIV infection remains somewhat difficult to determine. NTM disease is relatively uncommon; it is not a reportable health event, and environmental exposure varies greatly by geographic region. Further, clinically insignificant colonization or contamination can be difficult to distinguish from true disease, which can render laboratory-based surveillance potentially inaccurate, and the risk factors for disease have not yet been fully defined.

To expand our understanding of the epidemiology of NTM, we reviewed the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients without known HIV infection who had positive cultures for NTM from 2000–2003. We sought to determine the incidence of NTM disease and colonization, the risk factors for NTM disease, and the species of mycobacteria associated with different clinical syndromes at our urban medical center.

People with HIV who have CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 and who are not receiving ART, remain viremic on ART, or have no options for a fully suppressive ART regimen should receive chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC (AI). Before prophylaxis is initiated, disseminated MAC disease should be ruled out by clinical assessment and, if appropriate based on that assessment, by obtaining a blood culture for MAC. MAC prophylaxis should be delayed until results are available to avoid exposing patients to monotherapy and the attendant risk of drug resistance (AI).

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) timing to prevent immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in antiretroviral-naive HIV patients with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): Initiation of ART generally should be withheld until after the first 2 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy have been completed, then ART should be started as soon as possible after the first 2 weeks to reduce risks and improve response (weak, very low). Children with moderate symptoms of IRIS can be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or, if unresponsive, a short course (such as 4 weeks) of systemic corticosteroid therapy while continuing ART.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112gaiTn]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) clinical manifestations in people with HIV — In people with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), MAC disease generally presents as a disseminated, multi-organ infection, although localized disease may also be seen. Early symptoms may be minimal and can precede mycobacteremia or positive tissue cultures by several weeks. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities particularly associated with disseminated MAC disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels, and hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be identified on examination or imaging. Localized MAC disease occurs more often in people with HIV on suppressive ART with increased CD4 counts than in people with HIV not on ART, with localized syndromes including lymphadenitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, and central nervous system infection; localized syndromes may also be manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

### The brief case: complexity of laboratory diagnosis of-a classic case of an unusual pathogen [^111ZkZFR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Common risk factors associated with M. genavense infection include patients living with HIV and AIDS who are not on ART, solid organ transplant recipients, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The typical clinical presentations include fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, anemia, adenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. However, more recent studies have described a wider range of presentations including the presence of sarcoidosis, masses, or pseudotumor. For example, one report describes a case of pseudo-Whipple's disease and sclerosing cholangitis due to M. genavense. It is important to note that the full clinical impact of this mycobacterium remains understudied given the existing limitations of recovering M. genavense using routine AFB laboratory processes.

Mycobacterium genavense has historically been confused with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) due to their similar risk factors, clinical presentation, histopathologic features, and even phenotypic characteristics, such as nonchromogenic colony formation. However, the risk factors for MAC may include primary existing chronic lung infection such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and pneumoconiosis. Both infections coincide with risks factors such as HIV/AIDS patients predominantly with very low CD4 counts (< 50 cells/mm 3); both infections lead to constitutional symptoms, abdominal pain, and widespread lymphadenopathy. This typically commences with abdominal lymphadenopathy, which reflects the gastrointestinal source of infection. Despite having similar clinical presentations to the MAC group, phylogenetic studies have demonstrated M. genavense clusters more closely to the M. simiae complex based on 16S rRNA, rpo B, and hsp65 sequencing.

### Mycobacterium avium complex: addressing gaps in diagnosis and management [^117KXb9d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and an important cause of disease. The most common species causing pulmonary disease are members of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) can be chronic, debilitating, costly, and associated with a high mortality. However, MAC diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Patients with risk factors and who meet the diagnostic criteria — which include clinical, radiological, and microbiologic criteria — should be considered for treatment. Diagnosis requires 2 or more positive sputum cultures or 1 bronchoscopic specimen culture. The recommendation for those who are treated is a 3-drug regimen including macrolide, rifamycin, and ethambutol that is continued for 12 months beyond sputum culture conversion to negative. MAC-PD is difficult to treat, with frequent drug-related side effects and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Refractory and recurrent disease is common, leading to lifelong follow-up of patients. There are limited treatment options for patients with macrolide-resistant or refractory disease. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is recommended for treatment-refractory patients whose cultures remain positive after 6 months of guideline-based therapy. Among the research priorities to improve patient outcomes and quality of life are developing new, more rapid diagnostic tests, investigating biomarkers associated with disease progression, and identifying new drugs and routes of administration as well as new, shorter, and better-tolerated regimens.

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 71 patients with mycobacterial bacteraemia, infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n = 47) and not infected with HIV (n = 24) are described. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) (54.9%) constituted the most frequently isolated mycobacterium, followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (38.0%), Mycobacterium kansasii (4.2%), and Mycobacterium abscessus (2.8%). The Beijing family genotype was the most common type in MTB, and Mycobacterium intracellulare was the most common species in MAC. The overall mortality rate was 33.8%; it was lower in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected patients were younger, had fewer underlying diseases and better nutritional status, and were more likely to have MAC bacteraemia than MTB bacteraemia.

14.1 Clinical Studies in Patients with Advanced HIV Infection for the Prevention and Treatment of Disease Due to Disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC)

[see Indications and Usage (1)]

Prevention of Disseminated MAC Disease

Two randomized, double-blind clinical trials were performed in patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mcL. The first trial (Study 155) compared azithromycin (1,200 mg once weekly) to placebo and enrolled 182 patients with a mean CD4 count of 35 cells/mcL. The second trial (Study 174) randomized 723 patients to either azithromycin (1,200 mg once weekly), rifabutin (300 mg daily), or the combination of both. The mean CD4 count was 51 cells/mcL. The primary endpoint in these trials was disseminated MAC disease. Other endpoints included the incidence of clinically significant MAC disease and discontinuations from therapy for drug-related side effects.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) timing with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in people with HIV — initiation, continuation, and regimen modification — states that the rationale for starting ART as soon as possible is to reduce the risk of further AIDS-defining OIs and to further improve the response to antimycobacterial therapy in the setting of advanced immunosuppression (CIII); if ART has already been initiated, it should be continued, and the regimens should be modified when there is any potential for an adverse drug-drug interaction(s) between the antiretroviral and antimycobacterial drugs (CIII), noting that people with HIV will need continuous antimycobacterial treatment unless ART results in immune reconstitution.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) treatment in HIV — initial treatment should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance (AI), with clarithromycin the preferred first agent (AI); azithromycin can be substituted for clarithromycin when drug interactions or intolerance preclude its use (AII). Testing MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended for all people with HIV. Ethambutol is the recommended second drug for the initial treatment of MAC disease (AI), and some clinicians would add rifabutin as a third drug (CI); randomized trials completed before effective antiretroviral therapy found that adding rifabutin to clarithromycin and ethambutol improved survival and reduced emergence of drug resistance in individuals with AIDS and disseminated MAC disease, but whether similar results would be observed with effective ART has not been established. Some experts would recommend adding a third or fourth drug in high‑risk settings such as advanced immunosuppression (CD4 count < 50 cells/ mm3), high mycobacterial loads (> 2 log10 colony-forming units/ mL of blood), and/or the absence of effective ART (CIII); options include a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin (CIII) or an injectable agent such as amikacin or streptomycin (CIII).

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — diagnosis relies on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with isolation of MAC from sterile-site cultures, with species identification using molecular techniques or biochemical tests; ancillary studies (acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of stool or tissue biopsy material and radiographic imaging) provide supportive information. Detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract may represent colonization and may be a harbinger of disseminated infection, and routine screening of respiratory or GI specimens and pre-emptive treatment for MAC is not recommended because no data are available regarding efficacy of treating asymptomatic colonization with clarithromycin, azithromycin, rifabutin, or other drugs alone or in combination.

The incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease in HIV-negative patients was studied prospectively from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002 through 32 sentinel sites distributed all over France. Among the 275 patients who yielded MAC isolates from respiratory clinical specimens, 101 (36.7%) met the bacteriological, radiographical and clinical criteria established by the American Thoracic Society for nontuberculous mycobacterial respiratory disease. Of these 101 patients, 81 had underlying lung disease, mainly previous tuberculosis, bronchectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among the 20 patients with no underlying lung disease, 12 had a predisposing factor such as leukaemia or immunosuppressive treatment and eight had no predisposing factor. All patients with MAC respiratory disease had clinical symptoms, commonly cough and fatigue, and 52 (51.5%) were sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacillus. The ratio of patients with Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in France was estimated to be 3% and the incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease in France was 0.2 per 100,000 inhabitants.

### Mycobacterium avium complex in patients with HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy [^112DeQLy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a common complication of late-stage HIV-1 infection. Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the rate of MAC infection has declined substantially, but patients with low CD4 cell counts remain at risk. Among patients in the Johns Hopkins cohort with advanced HIV disease, the proportion developing MAC has fallen from 16% before 1996 to 4% after 1996, with a current rate of less than 1% per year. Factors associated with developing MAC include younger age, no use of HAART, and enrollment before 1996. Prophylaxis with azithromycin or clarithromycin is recommended for all patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mL. Optimum treatment for disseminated MAC includes clarithromycin and ethambutol, and another investigation suggests that the addition of rifabutin might reduce mortality. Both prophylaxis and treatment of disseminated MAC can be discontinued in patients who have responded to HAART, and specific guidelines for withdrawing treatment have been published. Although HAART has altered the frequency and outcome of MAC infection, it remains an important complication of AIDS.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) secondary prophylaxis — discontinuation after immune recovery: Some experts recommend discontinuation of therapy in children with HIV who meet all the following criteria: aged ≥ 2 years and have completed ≥ 12 months of treatment for MAC; remain asymptomatic for MAC; receiving stable ART (i.e. ART not requiring change for virologic or immunologic failure); and have sustained (≥ 6 months) CD4 count recovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of primary prophylaxis (i.e., as in adults, > 100 cells/mm3 for children aged ≥ 6 years [strong, low], and > 200 cells/mm3 for children aged 2 to < 6 years [weak, very low]). There are no randomized clinical trials in children on discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis, and multidrug secondary prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4 count falls below the age-related threshold.

### Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) with reduced susceptibility to ethambutol in an HIV-infected patient [^112iCv5o]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lymphadenitis complicated by immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) and reduced susceptibility to ethambutol.

Case Summary

A 24-year-old man was diagnosed in October 2012 with advanced HIV infection upon hospitalization for multiple opportunistic infections (OIs). Within 5 months of starting antiretroviral therapy, the patient developed significant cervical lymphadenopathy concerning for MAC/IRIS. Acid-fast bacilli were detected in the primary lymph node biopsy smear, and culture results confirmed the presence of MAC. Susceptibility testing revealed an organism susceptible to azithromycin, with an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ethambutol (8 µg/mL). Currently, there is no interpretation for an ethambutol MIC of 8 µg/mL for MAC. A review of the primary literature revealed the possibility of decreased ethambutol susceptibility when the MIC is above 1 µg/mL, and therefore, therapy was replaced by rifabutin in combination with azithromycin.

Discussion

Current guidelines recommend a 2-drug regimen for the treatment of MAC, specifically a macrolide plus ethambutol. Guidelines also emphasize MAC susceptibility testing for macrolides only. Susceptibility results from this patient's biopsy prompted an evaluation of the effectiveness of his antimycobacterial regimen.

Conclusions

Reduced ethambutol susceptibility in this patient triggered a search of the primary literature that resulted in the decision to replace ethambutol with rifabutin. Additional clinical trials are needed to define susceptibility breakpoints for ethambutol and other antimycobacterial agents used for MAC infection treatment and to direct clinical decisions when elevated MICs to primary agents are identified.

### The expanding spectrum of Mycobacterium avium complex-associated pulmonary disease [^115uiYZq]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly recognized as important pulmonary pathogens. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAC) causes most lung infections due to NTM. Patients with preexisting lung disease or immunodeficiency are at greatest risk for developing MAC infection. The majority of MAC pulmonary cases, however, occur in immunocompetent elderly women in association with nodular infiltrates and bronchiectasis. More recently, pulmonary disease has also been described in immunocompetent patients after exposure to MAC-contaminated hot tubs. We describe a case of aggressive MAC lung disease in a young immunocompetent female patient without preexisting lung disease whose clinical and pathologic characteristics do not fit into any of these categories and may represent a unique manifestation of MAC lung disease.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in children with HIV — prevention recommendations emphasize that MAC is ubiquitous and exposure avoidance guidance is not supported; person-to-person transmission is not believed to be common. The most effective way to prevent disseminated MAC in children with HIV infection is to preserve immune function through use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Children with HIV infection who have advanced immunosuppression should be offered prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease according to the CD4 count thresholds for children, and before prophylaxis is initiated in at-risk children, disseminated MAC disease must be ruled out, which includes obtaining a blood culture for MAC.

Mycobacterium avium complex

Most cases of disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are described in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS, malignancy and solid organ transplant. It is however possible for MAC to result in disseminated infections in immunocompetent individuals as well.

Manifestation of disseminated MAC (DMAC) infection in immunocompromised individuals has been widely documented: lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss and night sweats. On the other hand, clinical presentation of DMAC in immunocompetent hosts appears to be limited to localised pulmonary infection in patients with underlying pulmonary conditions. A case series on MAC infections in immunocompetent hosts cited cervical lymphadenopathy as the common presenting feature. There have been case reports of MAC causing hepatic granulomas in immunocompetent individuals.

Leprosy

Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disorder caused by M. leprae. It presents as a spectrum of clinical and pathological features:
Lepromatous leprosy, which may present with multiple lesions, extensive skin and internal organ involvement. Usually lesions are diffusely infiltrated with numerous leprotic bacilli.
Tuberculoid leprosy, which is characterised by a single or few skin lesions and involvement of the nerve at the site of the lesions. Skin biopsies of patients with tuberculoid leprosy demonstrate well-defined giant cell granuloma with or without caseous necrosis and dermal nerve destruction. Leprotic bacilli are usually scanty.

The diagnosis of leprosy is made based on clinical and histological findings. It may be difficult to differentiate tuberculoid leprosy from other infectious and non-infectious granulomas, such as those of syphilis and sarcoidosis, in view of the paucity of leprotic bacilli.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — criteria to stop or restart secondary prophylaxis/chronic maintenance therapy are conditional on treatment completion, symptoms, and sustained immune recovery. In people with HIV who have completed at least a 12-month MAC treatment course, remain asymptomatic with respect to MAC signs and symptoms, and sustain an increase in CD4 count to > 100 cells/mm3 for ≥ 6 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), it is reasonable to discontinue maintenance therapy (AI). Reintroducing chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis may be indicated (BIII) for those for whom a fully suppressive ART regimen is not possible and who have a decline in CD4 count to levels consistently below 100 cells/mm3.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation with disseminated MAC in people with HIV: ART should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of MAC disease, preferably at the same time as initiation of antimycobacterial therapy in people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who are not receiving effective ART (BIII). ART is recommended as soon as possible to reduce the risk of further AIDS-defining OIs and to further improve the response to antimycobacterial therapy in the setting of advanced immunosuppression (BIII); if ART has already been initiated, it should be continued, and regimens should be modified when there is any potential for an adverse drug–drug interaction(s) between the antiretroviral (ARV) and antimycobacterial drugs (BIII). People with HIV will need continuous antimycobacterial treatment until ART results in sustained immune reconstitution, as indicated above (CD4 count maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months).

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) clinical manifestations in pediatric HIV — respiratory symptoms are uncommon in children with HIV infection who have disseminated MAC, and isolated pulmonary disease is rare. Early symptoms can be minimal and may precede mycobacteremia by several weeks, and symptoms commonly associated with disseminated MAC infection in children include persistent or recurrent fever, weight loss or failure to gain weight, sweats, fatigue, and persistent diarrhea.

### Disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria in HIV-infected patients, Oregon, USA, 2007–2012 [^116JR7SA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly implicated in human diseases worldwide. Disseminated NTM infections are seen exclusively among immunocompromised hosts, including those with AIDS. Historically, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) has been among the most common AIDS-presenting diagnoses, with a 49% case-fatality rate at 1 year. After 1987, the number of reported disseminated NTM infections grew with the prevalence of AIDS; in 1990, between 15% and 24% of US residents with AIDS had disseminated NTM (primarily MAC).

After the US Public Health Service formally recommended prophylaxis for MAC prevention in 1993 and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became widespread in 1996, disseminated MAC in HIV patients declined. Incidence estimates of 10,000 cases/100,000 person-years in 1992 declined to 250 cases/100,000 person-years in 2007 in the United States; however, patient populations studied were limited to those established in specialty HIV care. Modern-day population-based estimates are lacking. Having access to statewide NTM isolates and HIV case reporting, we sought to generate a population-based estimate of disseminated NTM disease incidence among patients infected with HIV in Oregon, USA.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV — definition, risk factors, presentation, timing, and management — is described as a paradoxical worsening of clinical status related to recovery of the immune system after initiation of ART, with mycobacterial infections, particularly M. tuberculosis and MAC, most frequent and fungal (Cryptococcus, PCP) and viral (cytomegalovirus) infections also associated; initiating ART in close proximity to treatment for an acute opportunistic infection increases risk of IRIS, patients who develop IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive at ART initiation, and lower CD4+ cell counts are also associated. Common presenting symptoms consist of fever and lymphadenopathy with chest radiographic patterns including pulmonary infiltrates, nodules or masses, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion, and diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion of other causes; the majority of IRIS cases occur within the first 1 to 3 months after ART initiation. Most cases are mild and outcomes are generally good with supportive therapy; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids may be used, patients on ART can continue their regimens, and when to start ART in patients with opportunistic infections remains controversial although early ART may be beneficial, with caution that timing in critically ill patients is not well studied and may carry potential harm from ART-related toxicity or inflammatory reactions.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (maintenance therapy), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to discontinue chronic maintenance therapy if all of the following are met:

- completed at least 12 months therapy

- no signs and symptoms of M. avium complex disease

- sustained (> 6 months) cluster of differentiation count > 100 cells/mm³ in response to antiretroviral therapy.

ART initiation with disseminated MAC — timing to reduce immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS): In patients with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who have not been previously ART treated, or are not receiving effective ART initiation, ART generally should be withheld until after the first 2 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy have been completed to reduce the risk of drug interactions and complications associated with IRIS and to lower the pill burden (weak, very low).

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — special considerations during pregnancy outline when to avoid or prefer specific agents for prophylaxis and maintenance in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART). During pregnancy, if ART is being immediately initiated, then primary prophylaxis for MAC disease is not recommended (AIII). When primary prophylaxis is required because of the absence of effective ART, azithromycin is the preferred agent (BIII); for secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy), azithromycin plus ethambutol is the preferred drug combination (BIII). Because clarithromycin is associated with an increased risk of birth defects based on evidence from certain animal studies, it is not recommended as the first-line agent for prophylaxis or treatment of MAC in pregnancy (BIII).

### Respiratory infections associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria in non-HIV patients [^114Z35ZL]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary diseases in HIV-negative patients was studied prospectively from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003 by 32 sentinel sites distributed throughout France. In total, 262 patients who yielded NTM isolates from respiratory clinical specimens, met the bacteriological, radiological and clinical criteria established by the American Thoracic Society for NTM respiratory disease. Among the 262 NTM isolates, 234 were slow-growing mycobacteria (125 Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), 66 M. xenopi, 34 M. kansasii) and 28 were rapidly growing mycobacteria (25 M. abscessus complex). In the Paris area, M. xenopi was the most frequently isolated species, followed by MAC. Most patients (> 50%), except those with M. kansasii, had underlying predisposing factors such as pre-existing pulmonary disease or immune deficiency. Asthenia, weight loss, chronic cough and dyspnoea were the most common clinical symptoms. The classical radiological appearance of NTM infections was indistinguishable from that observed in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In summary, the incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infections in HIV-negative patients was estimated at 0.74, 0.73 and 0.72 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — disseminated in people with HIV: People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should be treated for a minimum duration of 12 months (AII). Shorter duration of treatment may be considered depending on the degree of immunologic recovery following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (CIII); the CD4 count should be maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months before discontinuing MAC treatment.

### A study of discontinuing maintenance therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex: AIDS clinical trial group 393 study team [^116XSu2E]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The present nonrandomized prospective study evaluated whether antimycobacterial therapy for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) could be withdrawn from human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects who experienced immunologic recovery while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Eligible subjects had received macrolide-based therapy for least 12 months, were asymptomatic for MAC, had received HAART for at least 16 weeks, and had CD4+ T cell counts > 100 cells/microL. Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, with a median CD4+ T cell count of 240 cells/microL at the time of discontinuation of MAC therapy. Forty-seven subjects remained MAC free, whereas 1 subject developed localized MAC osteomyelitis. The median duration of follow-up while not receiving therapy was 77 weeks, and the incidence of MAC infection was 1.44/100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.04–8.01). Withdrawal of anti-MAC therapy appears to be safe in patients who have been treated with a macrolide-based regimen for at least 1 year and have an immunologic response on HAART.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — primary prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease is not recommended for adults and adolescents with HIV who immediately initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AII), and people with HIV who are not receiving ART or who remain viremic on ART but have no current options for a fully suppressive ART regimen should receive chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease if they have CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 (AI). Primary MAC prophylaxis, if previously initiated, should be discontinued in adults and adolescents who are continuing on a fully suppressive ART regimen (AII), and two randomized, placebo-controlled trials and observational data have demonstrated that people with HIV taking ART can discontinue primary prophylaxis with minimal risk of developing MAC disease. In an analysis of 369 people with HIV with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 while on ART and followed for at least six months, the overall incidence of MAC disease was 0.6 per 100 person-months, with no MAC among 71 persons on ART who were virologically suppressed at baseline, including 41 not receiving primary prophylaxis; another study enrolled 157 people with HIV with at least one CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3 and found that the incidence of MAC disease was not statistically significantly different between those receiving primary prophylaxis and those not (3.4 per 100 person-years versus 0.8 per 100 person-years), with no differences in achieving a CD4 count > 100 cells/mm3 or viral suppression within 12 months. In each of these studies, plasma HIV RNA level > 1,000 copies/mL was the principal risk factor for developing MAC disease regardless of MAC prophylaxis.
