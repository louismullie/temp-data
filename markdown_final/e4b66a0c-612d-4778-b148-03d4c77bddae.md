## Question

A 46-year-old man comes to the physician for routine physical examination. His blood pressure is 158/96 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a potassium concentration of 3.1 mEq/L. His plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) to plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio is 47 (N < 10). A saline infusion test fails to suppress aldosterone secretion. A CT scan of the abdomen shows bilateral adrenal gland abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Bilateral adrenalectomy
B. Eplerenone therapy
C. Amiloride therapy
D. Propranolol therapy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the most appropriate next step in managing a 46-year-old man with confirmed primary aldosteronism, bilateral adrenal abnormalities on CT, and a non-suppressed aldosterone on saline infusion, and to choose among bilateral adrenalectomy, eplerenone, amiloride, or propranolol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is firmly established. Then, I should verify the subtype and whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral. Next, I will review guideline-based treatment pathways for bilateral disease. After that, I need to compare the pharmacologic options and their roles. Finally, I will consider exceptions and monitoring, and then select the best answer with clear justification.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before moving to management decisions. The patient has hypertension with spontaneous hypokalemia, an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio, and failure of aldosterone suppression on saline infusion, which together confirm autonomous aldosterone excess and establish primary aldosteronism beyond doubt, so I do not need further confirmatory testing here [^116UCtfg] [^116dXDd6] [^1122cUV8].

> Wait, let me verify the subtype because treatment hinges on lateralization. The CT shows bilateral adrenal abnormalities, which strongly suggests bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia rather than a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma. In this scenario, I should not jump to surgery without lateralization, and adrenal vein sampling would typically be the next step if surgery were contemplated, but given bilateral imaging and no clear unilateral lesion, medical therapy is favored over surgery [^116UCtfg] [^1122cUV8] [^111pLrgf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is managed medically rather than surgically because bilateral disease is not cured by unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy; surgery is reserved for unilateral excess documented by adrenal vein sampling, so bilateral adrenalectomy would be inappropriate here and risks adrenal insufficiency without correcting the pathophysiology [^116UCtfg] [^1122cUV8] [^114d3Hy6].

> I need to check the guideline-backed medical therapy. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are first-line for bilateral primary aldosteronism, with spironolactone or eplerenone recommended to control blood pressure, correct hypokalemia, and mitigate aldosterone-mediated cardiovascular risk; eplerenone is a selective MRA and is a correct choice among the options provided [^116UCtfg] [^1122cUV8] [^114d3Hy6].

> Let me consider the other options carefully. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that blocks the epithelial sodium channel and can be used adjunctively for hypokalemia, but it is not first-line monotherapy for bilateral primary aldosteronism and does not provide the disease-modifying blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors, so it is less appropriate as the primary next step here [^116dUjvc] [^114d3Hy6]. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, can worsen false-positive ARR by suppressing renin and does not treat the underlying aldosterone excess, so it is not indicated for primary aldosteronism management in this context [^111zJKX4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought adrenal vein sampling might still be necessary, but I should double-check the indication. AVS is indicated when surgery is being considered to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease; here, the CT already suggests bilateral disease and there is no clear unilateral target for surgery, so proceeding with medical therapy is appropriate without AVS in this case, though AVS would be warranted if imaging suggested unilateral disease or if the patient strongly desired surgical evaluation despite bilateral imaging [^116UCtfg] [^1122cUV8] [^111pLrgf].

> I should confirm practical next steps for initiating therapy. Start a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as eplerenone, correct potassium, consider dietary sodium restriction, and monitor blood pressure, potassium, renal function, and renin at follow-up to titrate therapy and ensure physiologic reversal of aldosterone excess. This approach aligns with guideline algorithms for bilateral primary aldosteronism [^114Wc6KN] [^114d3Hy6] [^1122cUV8].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is medical therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and among the listed choices, eplerenone is the correct selection because it is guideline-endorsed first-line therapy for bilateral primary aldosteronism, whereas bilateral adrenalectomy is contraindicated, amiloride is adjunctive rather than primary, and propranolol is inappropriate mechanistically and may confound testing if used diagnostically [^116UCtfg] [^1122cUV8] [^114d3Hy6].

---

The most appropriate next step is **eplerenone therapy** [^1122cUV8] because the patient has confirmed primary aldosteronism with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which is managed medically with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^114d3Hy6]. Bilateral adrenalectomy is inappropriate due to the risk of adrenal insufficiency [^115umc9U], and amiloride or propranolol are not first-line for this condition [^notfound]. Eplerenone will control blood pressure, correct hypokalemia, and reduce cardiovascular risk [^113wSohp].

---

## Diagnostic summary

- **Hypertension**: 158/96 mm Hg.
- **Hypokalemia**: 3.1 mEq/L.
- **Elevated ARR**: 47 (normal < 10).
- **Confirmatory test**: Saline infusion test fails to suppress aldosterone.
- **Imaging**: Bilateral adrenal abnormalities consistent with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical implications

Primary aldosteronism is characterized by **autonomous aldosterone excess**, leading to sodium retention, potassium wasting, and suppressed renin, causing hypertension and hypokalemia [^117MZuki]. It is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure [^115umc9U].

---

## Management options

### Medical management

Medical management centers on **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)** — spironolactone or eplerenone — which block aldosterone receptors, thereby controlling blood pressure, correcting hypokalemia, and reducing cardiovascular risk [^113wSohp]. Eplerenone is preferred for its **selective mineralocorticoid receptor blockade** and a lower risk of gynecomastia and menstrual irregularities compared with spironolactone [^116dUjvc].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management is considered for **unilateral disease** — typically an aldosterone-producing adenoma — where adrenalectomy can be curative [^113wSohp]. Bilateral adrenalectomy is generally avoided due to the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the need for lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Bilateral adrenalectomy | - Inappropriate due to risk of adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Reserved for rare refractory cases | Inappropriate |
| B. Eplerenone therapy | - First-line medical therapy for bilateral adrenal hyperplasia <br/> - Controls BP, corrects hypokalemia, reduces CV risk | Appropriate |
| C. Amiloride therapy | - Potassium-sparing diuretic <br/> - Less effective than MRAs <br/> - Not first-line | Inappropriate |
| D. Propranolol therapy | - Beta-blocker <br/> - Does not address aldosterone excess <br/> - Not indicated | Inappropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **eplerenone therapy** [^1122cUV8] because the patient has confirmed primary aldosteronism with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which is managed medically with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^114d3Hy6]. Eplerenone will effectively control blood pressure, correct hypokalemia, and reduce cardiovascular risk without the complications associated with bilateral adrenalectomy [^113wSohp].

### Primary aldosteronism: diagnostic and treatment strategies [^112z5Smv]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is caused by bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia in approximately two-thirds of cases and aldosterone-producing adenoma in one-third. Most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. In the clinical setting of normokalemic hypertension, patients who have resistant hypertension and hypertensive patients with a family history atypical for polygenic hypertension should be tested for primary aldosteronism. The ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity has been generally accepted as a first-line case-finding test. If a patient has an increased ratio, autonomous aldosterone production must be confirmed with an aldosterone suppression test. Once primary aldosteronism is confirmed, the subtype needs to be determined to guide treatment. The initial test in subtype evaluation is CT imaging of the adrenal glands. If surgical treatment is considered, adrenal vein sampling is the most accurate method for distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral adrenal aldosterone production. Optimal treatment for aldosterone-producing adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia is unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The idiopathic bilateral hyperplasia and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism subtypes should be treated pharmacologically. All patients treated pharmacologically should receive a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, a drug type that has been shown to block the toxic effects of aldosterone on nonepithelial tissues.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to measure serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with patients seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Obtain potassium levels to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone, as low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone.

Future Perspectives of PA Clinical Care

The field of PA research is progressing rapidly and is yielding significant advances that are already being transitioned into the clinical arena, raising the hope that many more patients will soon benefit from earlier diagnosis, more effective clinical, laboratory and radiological phenotyping, and the development of a personalized management strategy. The past decade in particular, has established PA as the major, potentially reversible, secondary cause of hypertension, provided novel insights in to the underlying pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder, delivered improved and more robust assays for measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone, yielded major advances in molecular imaging that permit not just lateralization but precise localization of culprit lesions, and provided insights (albeit in limited circumstances) for adrenal sparing interventions. In parallel, the arrival of more effective medical therapies should allow more effective prevention and mitigation of the adverse effects associated with hyperaldosteronism in those patients for whom other interventions are not feasible or preferred.

Introduction

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) comprise a heterogeneous group of familial and sporadic disorders characterized by a relatively autonomous renin-independent aldosterone production syndrome. PA can be classified into subtypes, that differ in terms of clinical management, including unilateral forms, which may be treated surgically (such as aldosterone-producing adenomas), and bilateral forms (such as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia/nodules) requiring medical management. The classical description of the disorder firstly made by Conn and colleagues in 1955 (syndrome of hypertension, sodium retention, and hypokalemic alkalosis that could be cured by removal of an adrenal cortical tumour) can be found in approximately one third of subjects, whilst adenoma with normokalaemia is the most common presentation. PA is a well characterized form of secondary hypertension in adults particularly in patients with resistant hypertension. Apart from being a potentially treatable form of hypertension, PA may also be an independent cardiovascular risk factor as affected subjects display an increased cardiovascular risk (including stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes and metabolic syndrome), which is not fully explained by blood pressure level. However, uncertainty exists regarding the prevalence of the syndrome in the general hypertensive population due to screening bias and non-uniform criteria used to diagnose. In fact, it is commonly accepted that there is a continuum between low-renin primary (essential) hypertension and PA and a diagnosis is only obtained in patients who fulfil the criteria suggested for its diagnosis. Because of this, PA remains an often unrecognized condition particularly in subjects with resistant hypertension. The aim of this document is therefore to raise awareness about PA, guide clinicians in the screening/diagnosis process and support the treatment strategy to mitigate the adverse cardiometabolic effects in otherwise undiagnosed individuals.

Objective

Our objective was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism.

Participants

The Task Force comprised a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, one methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

Systematic reviews of available evidence were used to formulate the key treatment and prevention recommendations. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. We used "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for weak recommendations.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and multiple e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the task force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Core Committee (CACC), and Council. The version approved by the CGS and CACC was placed on The Endocrine Society's Web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend case detection of primary aldosteronism be sought in higher risk groups of hypertensive patients and those with hypokalemia by determining the aldosterone-renin ratio under standard conditions and that the condition be confirmed/excluded by one of four commonly used confirmatory tests. We recommend that all patients with primary aldosteronism undergo adrenal computed tomography as the initial study in subtype testing and to exclude adrenocortical carcinoma. We recommend the presence of a unilateral form of primary aldosteronism should be established/excluded by bilateral adrenal venous sampling by an experienced radiologist and, where present, optimally treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. We recommend that patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or those unsuitable for surgery, optimally be treated medically by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114dAwKw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA), a primary adrenal disorder leading to excessive aldosterone production by one or both adrenal glands, is a common cause of hypertension. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications compared with primary hypertension. Despite effective methods for diagnosing and treating PA, it remains markedly underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Objective

To develop an updated guideline that provides a practical, clinical approach to identifying and managing PA to improve diagnosis rates and encourage targeted treatment.

Methods

The Guideline Development Panel (GDP), composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts and experts in systemic review methodology, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to define 10 questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of PA. Systematic reviews were conducted for each question. The GDP used the GRADE Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework to consider contextual factors, such as stakeholder values and preferences, costs and required resources, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and the potential impact on health equity.

Results

We suggest that all individuals with hypertension be screened for PA by measuring aldosterone and renin and determining the aldosterone to renin ratio, and that subsequent clinical care be guided by the results. We suggest that individuals with PA receive PA-specific therapy, either medical or surgical. In individuals who screen positive for PA, we suggest (1) commencement of PA-specific medical therapy in individuals who do not desire or are not candidates for surgery and in situations where the probability of lateralizing PA (excess aldosterone produced by one adrenal) is low based on screening results; and (2) aldosterone suppression testing in situations when screening results indicate an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA and individualized decision making confirms a desire to pursue eligibility for surgical therapy. In those who test positive by aldosterone suppression testing, and in those in whom screening results show a high probability of lateralizing PA (obviating the need for aldosterone suppression testing), we suggest adrenal lateralization with computed tomography scanning and adrenal venous sampling prior to deciding the treatment approach (medical vs surgical). In all individuals with PA and an adrenal adenoma, we suggest performing a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. We suggest the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) over epithelial sodium-channel (ENaC) inhibitors in the medical treatment of PA. We suggest the use of spironolactone over other MRAs, given its lower cost and greater availability; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating PA. Thus, MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor specificity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred in some situations. In individuals receiving MRA therapy, we suggest monitoring renin and, in those whose hypertension remains uncontrolled and renin is suppressed, titrating the MRA to increase renin.

Conclusion

These recommendations provide a practical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of PA. They are based on currently available literature and take into consideration outcomes that are important to key stakeholders. The goal is to increase identification of individuals with PA and, by initiating PA-specific medical or surgical therapy, improve blood pressure control and reduce PA-associated adverse cardiovascular events. The guidelines also highlight important knowledge gaps in PA diagnosis and management.

Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism

PA was diagnosed based on the 2016 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines. In summary, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and PRA are measured with appropriate patient preparation. Positive screening results for PA are defined by: an aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) > 20 (ng/dL)/(ng/mL/hr), PAC levels > 15 ng/dL, and PRA < 1.0 ng/mL/hr. Patients meeting all screening criteria proceed to confirmation testing, unless they present with either: spontaneous hypokalemia, undetectable PRA, and PAC > 20 ng/dL, or an ARR > 100 (ng/dL)/(ng/mL/hr). At our institution, the saline infusion test (SIT) is used for confirmation. Two liters of 0.9% saline are infused intravenously over four hours with the patient in a seated position, and PAC is measured before and after the infusion. A post-infusion PAC > 6 ng/dL confirms PA. Computed tomography and AVS are then performed to differentiate PA subtypes and distinguish between unilateral and bilateral adrenal disease. AVS can be omitted in patients with a high likelihood of unilateral PA, such as those under 35 years of age, with markedly elevated aldosterone, spontaneous hypokalemia, and a unilateral adenoma on imaging.

AVS procedures

AVS was performed by an interventional radiologist while administering an intravenous infusion of Cosyntropin at a rate of 50 mcg/h. Blood samples were collected at least 30 min after initiating the Cosyntropin infusion. Samples for cortisol and aldosterone were drawn from both adrenal veins and IVC. To confirm proper catheter placement in the adrenal veins, the SI was calculated. An SI ≥ 5 on each side confirmed correct catheter positioning in the adrenal vein, enabling the interpretation of the LI and contralateral suppression index (CI). Data collected from the AVS procedure included SI, LI, and CI. An LI of ≥ 4 was used as the cut-off to define unilateral PA. An LI < 4 was considered indicative of bilateral PA. Interpretation of the AVS results can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients with AVS results indicating a unilateral form of the disease were referred to a urologist for unilateral adrenalectomy.

### Respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis caused by severe hypokalemia in a young female with hypertension: a rare critical condition in primary aldosteronism [^111nBFrn]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hormonal evaluation to rule out other similar conditions, such as pheochromocytoma, was carried out (24-hour urine metanephrine: 20.9 µg/24 h, 24-hour urine normetanephrine: 50.8 µg/24 h). The urine screening test for pheochromocytoma was negative. Hence, we proceeded to the next step of the workup by measuring the level of serum aldosterone and renin (aldosterone: 13.20 ng/dL, plasma renin activity: 0.32 ng/mL/h, 24-hour urine free cortisol: 4.8 µg/24 h, 24-hour urine volume: 1050 ml/24 h).

Imaging studies during that hospital course included abdominopelvic ultrasonography and CT scan, color Doppler ultrasonography of both renal vessels, brain CT, and high-resolution CT of both lungs for better evaluation. Both kidneys were normal in size in the abdominopelvic ultrasonography but with mild bilateral stasis and increased cortical parenchymal echogenicity. Additionally, color Doppler ultrasonography of both renal vessels showed no stenosis or vascular abnormalities. Spiral abdominopelvic CT with and without contrast was highly suggestive of lipid-rich adrenal adenoma as there was evidence of a homogeneously 14 × 12 mm round mass structure in the left adrenal gland associated with acceptable delayed washout. The radiodensity of the mass was as follows: Pre-contrast 30 Hounsfield units (HU), post-contrast 100 HU, and delayed 45 HU. Therefore, the washout was above 60%, consistent with an adenoma (Fig. 1). A high-resolution CT of the lungs was taken because of her severe respiratory depression, which detected evidence of sub-segmental collapse consolidation in the posterior basal aspect of both lung fields and the right upper lobe. Brain CT was performed for the second time (the first time was upon hometown hospital admission), which did not reveal any pathologic findings. Based on the imaging studies and laboratory investigations, the clinical diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism resulting from adrenal adenoma was suggested.

Diagnosis and subtyping of PA

Confirmatory testing was performed in patients with an aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) ≥ 20 and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) > 15 ng/dL. We diagnosed PA in the case of PAC > 10 ng/dL after the saline infusion test in a recumbent position. Prior to either screening testing using ARR measurement or confirmatory testing, diuretics/mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers were changed to calcium channel or alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers for ≥ 6 and ≥ 2 weeks. However, PA was diagnosed without a confirmatory test in those patients with spontaneous hypokalemia, a plasma renin activity (PRA) below the detection limit, or a PAC > 20 ng/dL.

Subtypes of PA were categorized as unilateral hyperaldosteronism (UHA), bilateral hyperaldosteronism (BHA), and indeterminate type based on abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) results under adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. AVS was recommended when surgical treatment was feasible and desired by the patient. AVS was not performed when surgical treatment was not feasible or if there was renal dysfunction. The selectivity index (SI, adrenal vein cortisol concentration/inferior vena cava cortisol concentration) > 3 was defined as successful AVS. The lateralization index (LI) was calculated by dividing the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio on the dominant side by that on the non-dominant side, and an LI ≥ 4 was considered to indicate lateralized aldosteronism. UHA was defined when aldosterone secretion appeared lateralized based on AVS results. BHA was defined as a successful AVS result showing an LI < 3, regardless of the adrenal nodule on abdominal CT findings. The indeterminate PA subtype was defined as AVS failure or 3 ≤ LI < 4 on AVS results or no AVS data. The Contralateral ratio index (CI) was calculated by dividing the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio on the non-dominant side by that on the inferior vena cava. The contralateral ratio index (CI) was calculated by dividing the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio on the non-dominant side by that on the inferior vena cava. Contralateral suppression with a CI < 1 can be used as indicative of UHA on the opposite side in cases of indeterminate PA subtype (n = 162). Fifteen cases out of the 162 with an indeterminate PA subtype were recategorized as UHA. Concordance between CT and AVS findings was established when a unilateral adrenal nodule (> 0.7 cm) was identified on CT scans with AVS confirmation of lateralization to the same side, or when CT scans showed only normal-appearing adrenals and the AVS was indicative of BHA.

### Primary aldosteronism: are we diagnosing and operating on too few patients? [^116NSWdS]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Many cases of potentially curable primary aldosteronism are currently likely to be diagnosed as essential hypertension unless screening tests based on suppression of renin are carried out in all hypertensive patients. More than half of the patients with primary aldosteronism detected in this way have normal circulating potassium levels, so measurement of potassium is not enough to exclude primary aldosteronism. When primary aldosteronism is diagnosed, fewer than one-third of patients are suitable for surgery as initial treatment, but this still represents a significant percentage of hypertensive patients. After excluding glucocorticoid-suppressible primary aldosteronism, adrenal venous sampling is essential to detect unilateral production of aldosterone and diagnose angiotensin-responsive aldosterone-producing adenoma. One cannot rely on the computed tomography scan. If all hypertensive patients are screened for primary aldosteronism and the workup is continued methodically in those with a positive screening test, patients with unilateral overproduction of aldosterone who potentially can be cured surgically are not denied the possibility of cure.

### Incidence of primary aldosteronism uncomplicated "Essential" hypertension… [^114SNTST]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In a prospective study of the incidence of primary aldosteronism among patients with "essential" hypertension, this diagnosis could be excluded in 87 of 90 patients by the demonstration of normal aldosterone secretion or lack of suppression of plasma renin activity or both. In contrast, at least four of ten patients observed during the same period because of concomitant hypertension and unprovoked hypokalemia were proven to have primary aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism is, thus, a relatively rare cause of hypertension among patients with normal serum potassium concentrations, but should be carefully considered as a possible cause of hypertension among patients with hypokalemia. Subnormal plasma renin activity was found to be a characteristic of patients with "essential" hypertension as a group; marked suppression of plasma renin activity was found in five of 24 patients with "essential" hypertension.

Thus, although subnormal plasma renin activity can be used to distinguish primary from secondary aldosteronism, taken by itself, this finding is of limited value in diagnosis since it also occurs in many patients with "essential" hypertension.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xmfK7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for primary aldosteronism — In adults with hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism is recommended when any of the following are present to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy: resistant hypertension (regardless of whether hypokalemia is present), hypokalemia (spontaneous or diuretic induced), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), incidentally discovered adrenal mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at a young age (< 40 years). In adults with stage 2 hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism may be considered to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1116pwfn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 1 (screening in hypertension) states that in all individuals with hypertension, we suggest screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This is a conditional recommendation, with implementation depending on contextual factors such as available resources, local expertise, and healthcare system capacity, which may affect feasibility and prioritization. The recommendation emphasizes care that is informed and guided by screening, with a positive screening result serving as the critical first step in the care process for individuals with PA, and PA screening consists of measurements of serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity) with determination of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR); potassium is also assessed — not for screening itself — but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone.

### Primary aldosteronism: challenges in diagnosis and management [^111fwYvq]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the main cause of endocrine hypertension, present in approximately 10% of hypertensive patients; about one-third is secondary to aldosterone-producing adenomas. Cardiovascular and renal morbidity are out of proportion to the degree of hypertension. Physicians have compelling rationale to correctly identify and treat PA. Physicians are challenged with patient selection for screening with the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR), interpretation of ARR, and selecting a confirmatory test. Adrenal vein sampling is performed for subtype differentiation. The treatment depends on the disease subtype and results in control of hypertension and reversal of associated excess morbidity.

### Primary hyperaldosteronism: a case of unilateral adrenal hyperplasia with contralateral incidentaloma [^117Nz3eP]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperaldosteronism is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension but clear differentiation between its various subtypes can be a clinical challenge. We report the case of a 37-year-old African-American woman with refractory hypertension who was admitted to our hospital for palpitations, shortness of breath and headache. Her laboratory results showed hypokalaemia and an elevated aldosterone/renin ratio. An abdominal CT scan showed a nodule in the left adrenal gland but adrenal venous sampling showed elevated aldosterone/renin ratio from the right adrenal vein. The patient began a new medical regimen but declined any surgical options. We recommend clinicians to maintain a high level of suspicion to consider the less common subtypes of primary hyperaldosteronism, especially given the fact that the management greatly varies.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116dXDd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — saline suppression test: After sitting for 1 hour, blood should be drawn to mark t = 0. Two liters of normal saline are infused over 4 hours (500 mL/h for 4 hours) while maintaining a seated position, after which blood should be drawn; plasma aldosterone and serum potassium are measured at t = 0 and t = 4 hours. Plasma aldosterone < 162 pmol/L (5.8 ng/dL) via LC–MS/MS assay makes PA unlikely, and plasma aldosterone < 217 pmol/L (7.8 ng/dL) via immunoassay makes PA unlikely. Because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol; interpretation of results should be considered to be probabilistic as the evidence to support a singular diagnostic threshold is not firm. The protocol requires an in-person visit, space and staff to accommodate the procedures, and intravenous (IV) infusion of saline, and it should not be performed if baseline BP is uncontrolled, or in patients at high risk for pulmonary edema such as heart failure or advanced chronic kidney disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening interpretation, medication substitutions, confirmatory testing, treatment pathways, imaging criteria, and outcomes: Initial screening can generally be interpreted despite most medications; if suspicion remains high with negative or borderline results, potentially interfering drugs may be temporarily substituted with noninterfering agents for at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to repeat testing. Diagnosis may require an aldosterone suppression test such as an intravenous saline suppression test or oral salt-loading test. If confirmed and surgery is contemplated, referral for adrenal venous sampling determines whether aldosterone excess is unilateral or bilateral; unilateral excess is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, whereas bilateral secretion or non-surgical candidates are treated with an MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone). If primary aldosteronism is confirmed, adrenal imaging should be considered to exclude a large mass when features suggestive of malignancy are present (size > 4 cm). Treating primary aldosteronism with an MRA or unilateral adrenalectomy is associated with resolution of hypokalemia, lower BP, fewer antihypertensive medications, and improved cardiac and kidney function, and a meta-analysis of observational data suggests adrenalectomy may be associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with medical therapy.

Primary aldosteronism — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy initiation and monitoring algorithm specifies starting steps, goals, follow-up timing, and action branches based on blood pressure, potassium, kidney function, and renin. At initiation, the algorithm states: "With MRA initiation, consider hypertension severity and stop/reduce other anti-hypertensive medications if appropriate", "Stop K supplements within 2–4 days of MRA initiation unless severely hypokalemic", and "Recommend low sodium diet"; stated goals are "Blood pressure controlled; reduction of unnecessary other anti-hypertensive medications; normokalemia" and "Non-suppressed renin". Follow-up is scheduled at "2–3 MONTHS OR SOONER IF CLINICALLY INDICATED" to "Check BP, Potassium, Kidney Function, and Renin". Branch actions are as follows: if "BP Uncontrolled and Renin Not Suppressed", then "Add/Increase Non-MRA Anti-Hypertensive Medication"; if "BP Uncontrolled and Renin Suppressed OR Persistent Hypokalemia", then "Increase MRA Dose"; if "Renin Suppressed and other Non-MRA Anti-hypertensive Medications in Use", then "MRA Dose Increase; Stop/Reduce Non-MRA Anti-hypertensive Medications as Appropriate"; if "Renin Normal/ Increased vs Baseline", then "Routine Follow-up".

### Primary aldosteronism [^11735BdY]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is the underlying cause of hypertension in primary care settings in approximately 6% of cases, and it is even more common in patients with resistant hypertension. However, it is estimated that only about 2% of patients who have risk factors for primary aldosteronism have been formally tested or diagnosed. The first step in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is case detection and involves testing patients who are at risk, including individuals with resistant hypertension, as well as those with well-controlled hypertension and a first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism, hypokalemia, an adrenal nodule, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, or a family history of an early stroke (i.e., younger than 40 years). Initial case detection is performed by simultaneously measuring plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity; an elevated aldosterone-renin ratio (greater than 30) indicates independent aldosterone secretion (i.e., aldosteronism). After a positive case detection, confirmatory testing should be performed. Confirmatory tests include the captopril challenge, oral or intravenous salt loading, or fludrocortisone suppression. Results are positive if aldosterone levels remain high after interventions that suppress or interrupt physiologic production of aldosterone. If the confirmatory test is positive, adrenal computed tomography and adrenal vein sampling should be performed to differentiate unilateral from bilateral adrenal production of aldosterone. Patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism should undergo adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral production should be treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone or eplerenone.

Table 2
Discordance between AVS and cross sectional imaging according to meta-analysis performed in 2009 which included 38 studies and 950 patients. (Kempers et al.). In cases where CT is non-lateralizing (either because both glands are normal or both glands are abnormal) but AVS is lateralizing, patients would have been inappropriately excluded from potentially curative surgery. In cases where CT suggests unilateral production but AVS shows bilateral production, patients would be subjected to inappropriate surgery. Finally, in cases where CT demonstrates unilateral pathology but AVS demonstrates contralateral pathology, these patients would have undergone wrong side surgery

The proportion of patients with PA who have unilateral production determined by AVS differs by referral pattern and criteria used and is typically between 1/3rd and 2/3 rds of patients. Patients with more severe PA phenotype (i.e. spontaneous hypokalemia and/or higher aldosterone levels) are more likely to have an APA and therefore have unilateral production. While unilateral production can be effectively treated medically, patients who undergo AVS directed adrenalectomy have a high rate of biochemical cure (Table 3), a high rate of resolution of hypokalemia, potential for hypertension cure (≈35%), lower hypertensive medication need, less medication side effects and overall better quality of life (Rossi et al.). Higher rates of hypertension cure after adrenalectomy are seen in patients with short duration hypertension, younger age, normal renal function female gender and normal body mass index (Funder et al; Rossi et al.).

### Development of a clinical decision tool to reduce diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension [^117JXeUk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the strengths of this study is that the reference test was missing in only two of the 826 patients. Additionally, the chance of missing a PA case based on a false negative ARR is low: sensitivity of the ARR (cut-off value 5 pmol/fmol/s) reached 100% (95%CI 75.9–100%) in our laboratory and hypokalemia was corrected before it was determined. Since all patients were diagnosed by the same combined approach, our results do not suffer from differential verification bias. Yet, the aldosterone cut-off value of ≥ 280 pmol/L after saline infusion (as proposed by the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline) on which PA diagnosis was based, is rather arbitrary and results in a small number of false negative test results. Some patients with an intermediate post-SLT aldosterone (140–280 pmol/L) do have the clinical syndrome of PA based on adrenal computed tomography, adrenal venous sampling and/or expert panel assessment. However, sensitivity analysis showed that our decision tool also reliably selects patients at low risk for PA when a lower post-SLT cut-off value is used. In addition, patients with an intermediate test result are more likely to have idiopathic aldosteronism, limiting the chance of withholding a surgical cure for these patients, but possibly precluding them from receiving adequate medical treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Other patients may have pre-stages of PA, illustrating the importance of repeated screening by the decision tool after several months or years. Another strength of this study is that clinical variables were routinely collected, resembling daily clinical practice, which is critical in a diagnostic study.

### Systolic heart failure in a patient with primary aldosteronism [^112iv5Jh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 53-year-old African man with a 25-year history of uncontrolled hypertension and systolic heart failure presented with an acute congestive heart failure exacerbation. He was found to have severe hypokalaemia, so additional testing was performed, and primary aldosteronism was confirmed. CT scan showed a 1.2×2.4cm well-defined, homogeneous adenoma of the left adrenal gland. Adrenal vein sampling confirmed unilateral primary aldosteronism with lateralisation to the left adrenal gland. The patient was started on spironolactone and was referred to surgery for laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Primary aldosteronism is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to activation of cardiac mineralocorticoid receptors. Studies suggest these negative effects can be reduced with early intervention and treatment. This case highlights the importance of investigating secondary causes of hypertension in young patients and the potential adverse cardiac effects of primary aldosteronism when it goes undiagnosed and untreated for years.

### Intraprocedural cortisol testing improves adrenal vein cannulation success and diagnostic accuracy in assessment of primary aldosteronism, in a medium throughput centre [^115umc9U]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Independent of blood pressure effects, PA is associated with increased rates of stroke (OR 2.6), atrial fibrillation (OR 3.5), coronary artery disease (OR 1.8), heart failure (OR 2.1) and metabolic syndrome (OR 1.5). Treatment directed at reducing aldosterone action reduces the risk of these events. In unilateral disease, which comprises 30–50% of PA, surgical adrenalectomy is the preferred treatment and results in cure of hypertension, medication independence in > 50% of individuals and almost universal cure of hypokalaemia. Additionally, surgical management when compared to medical management is associated with lower rates of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke, and incidence of chronic kidney disease. To proceed safely to adrenalectomy, adrenal vein sampling is required to localise aldosterone secretion and is the gold standard for lateralisation. This is true even in the presence of a unilateral adrenal lesions identified on adrenal imaging, except, perhaps in young individuals. Confirmation is important due to the relative high frequency of biochemical discordance with imaging, which has been reported to be as high as 46%. Additionally, removal of the wrong gland results in the exposure to risk of an invasive adrenalectomy with no benefit and precludes removal of the contralateral gland due to the risk of adrenal insufficiency.

The next step, termed subtyping, is determining if production is unilateral or bilateral. In the former case, an aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) is the most likely cause with less likely etiologies being diffuse or nodular unilateral hyperplasia. Unilateral aldosterone production is most effectively treated with adrenalectomy. Bilateral production is termed idiopathic hyperplasia. Bilateral production is treated medically, utilizing mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and, if needed, potassium sparing diuretics like amiloride. Spironolactone is a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist which has anti-adrenergic effects potentially leading to gynecomastia and/or other sexual side effects. A more selective MR antagonist, eplerenone, can be used when spironolactone is not tolerated.

Advances in Lateralization and Localization

Lateralization and Localization: A Fundamental Requirement for Optimal Clinical Management

Adrenal vein sampling

As previously discussed in "Current Approach to Lateralization", following confirmation of a diagnosis of PA, cross-sectional imaging of the adrenal glands (CT or MRI) is typically undertaken to investigate for the presence of 1 or more nodules and exclude ACC (Fig. 1). Depending on local practice, it may also be used to derive information regarding the adrenal vasculature. However, as highlighted in an earlier section ("Current Approach to Lateralization"), anatomical imaging alone is generally not considered sufficiently sensitive or specific to be the sole mode of lateralization in most patients. This reflects the findings of several studies which have reported unsatisfactory performance in distinguishing UPA and bilateral disease to guide unilateral adrenalectomy. Although a single prospective study (SPARTACUS) challenged previously published retrospective data and suggested that AVS and adrenal CT were of equivalence as lateralization modalities for UPA, significant concerns have been raised regarding the study's design, which, in turn, has led several experts to question the validity of its findings.

Other workers have postulated that anatomical imaging alone may be sufficient to allow a patient to proceed direct to surgery without further lateralization when certain stringent conditions pertain: (1) severe PA phenotype with clearcut unilateral lesion > 1.5 cm in diameter, (2) young patients (< 35 years) with spontaneous hypokalemia, marked aldosterone excess, and unilateral adrenal lesion with radiological features consistent with a cortical adenoma on adrenal CT scan. However, careful clinical decision making is still necessary in these cases given that discordance between CT and AVS has been reported in younger patients. Additionally, as discussed in "Current Approach to Lateralization", even in cases where CT and AVS appear "concordant" prior to surgery (ie, identification of a prominent nodule on CT, with concordant ipsilateral AVS) the prominent CT identifiable nodule is not always the source of aldosterone secretion. As such, the use of AVS in tandem with CT imaging may not increase the lateralization power of CT to the degree that might be expected, and thereby question the validity of proceeding directly to adrenalectomy without assessing whether a CT identifiable nodule is functioning or not.

### Severe hyperkalemia following adrenalectomy for aldosteronoma: prediction, pathogenesis and approach to clinical management-a case series [^113Rore3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

As the field of Primary Aldosteronism (PA) becomes ever expanded, diagnosis of PA is increasingly diagnosed by endocrinologists. With increased PA screening, many of the cases are now found in patients with complex co-morbidities in addition to their hypertension. Post adrenalectomy renal impairment with hyperkalemia is now increasingly seen in these complex patients, as evidenced by the numerous reports on this issue that have appeared within the past 3 years. We present a small case series to illustrate the breadth of the problem, along with a discussion about how such CKD/hyperkalemic events may be predicted.

Case Presentation

We present three cases of primary aldosteronism with long standing hypertension (more than 10 years) hypokalemia (2.0–3.0 mmol/l). Serum aldosterone was high with low renin activity leading to high aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR). They underwent abdominal CT scan revealing adrenal mass and adrenal vein sample confirmed lateralization. None of the patients had evidence of renal disease before surgery (as evident by normal eGFR and serum creatinine). Post adrenalectomy they had reduction in the blood pressure and became eukalemic. Serum aldosterone and renin activity were low leading to a low ARR. Case 1 developed hyperkalemia and increased serum creatinine 6 weeks post operatively which resolved with initiation of fludrocortisone and every attempt to discontinue fludrocortisone resulted in hyperkalemia and rising creatinine. Her hyperkalemia is under control with oral sodium bicarbonate. Case 2 developed hyperkalemia and increasing creatinine 2 months post operatively transiently requiring fludrocortisone and later on managed with furosemide for hyperkalemia. Case 3 developed renal impairment and hyperkalemia 2 weeks post operatively requiring fludrocortisone.

Conclusion

Post APA resection severe hyperkalemia may be a common entity and screening should be actively considered in high risk patients. Older age, longer duration of hypertension, impaired pre-op and post-op GFR and higher levels of pre-op aldosterone and are all risk factors which predict the likelihood of developing post-operative hyperkalemia. Fludrocortisone, sodium bicarbonate, loop diuretics and potassium binders can be used for treatment. Treatment choice should be tailored to patient characteristics including fluid status, blood pressure and serum creatinine. Potassium binders should be avoided in patients with history of recent abdominal surgery, opioid use and constipation. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored every 1–2 weeks after starting treatment to ensure an adequate response. Prolonged management may be necessary in some cases and at-risk patients should be counselled as to the meaning and importance of post-operative changes in measured renal function and potassium.

### The management of primary aldosteronism: case detection, diagnosis, and treatment: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116UCtfg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with primary aldosteronism.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, six additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The guideline was cosponsored by American Heart Association, American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, European Society of Endocrinology, European Society of Hypertension, International Association of Endocrine Surgeons, International Society of Endocrinology, International Society of Hypertension, Japan Endocrine Society, and The Japanese Society of Hypertension. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

We searched for systematic reviews and primary studies to formulate the key treatment and prevention recommendations. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. We used "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for weak recommendations.

Consensus Process

We achieved consensus by collecting the best available evidence and conducting one group meeting, several conference calls, and multiple e-mail communications. With the help of a medical writer, the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and Council successfully reviewed the drafts prepared by the Task Force. We placed the version approved by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee on the Endocrine Society's website for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated necessary changes.

Conclusions

For high-risk groups of hypertensive patients and those with hypokalemia, we recommend case detection of primary aldosteronism by determining the aldosterone-renin ratio under standard conditions and recommend that a commonly used confirmatory test should confirm/exclude the condition. We recommend that all patients with primary aldosteronism undergo adrenal computed tomography as the initial study in subtype testing and to exclude adrenocortical carcinoma. We recommend that an experienced radiologist should establish/exclude unilateral primary aldosteronism using bilateral adrenal venous sampling, and if confirmed, this should optimally be treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. We recommend that patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or those unsuitable for surgery should be treated primarily with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113o1Ei8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) management algorithm — In adults with hypertension in whom PA is likely, care is stratified by the probability of lateralizing PA. Low probability means "pursuing aldosterone suppression testing is not clinically necessary", and features can include "Aldosterone < 11 ng/dL (~305 pmol/L) by immunoassay or < ~8 ng/dL (~222 pmol/L) by LC–MS/MS", with patients who are low probability eligible to be "offered MRA therapy without further testing". High probability allows aldosterone suppression testing to be bypassed and is characterized by severe features such as hypokalemia and "Very low renin (PRC < 2 mIU/L or PRA < 0.2 ng/mL/h) with elevated aldosterone > 20 ng/dL (~554 pmol/L) by immunoassay or > ~15 ng/dL (~416 pmol/L) by LC–MS/MS", after which "cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be pursued". Intermediate probability prompts shared decision-making, where the patient may "prefer an empirical trial of MRA over proceeding to aldosterone suppression testing ± AVS", and lifelong medical therapy with a "mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)" is "usually offered" for bilateral/unknown lateralization and "to those who are not surgical candidates or who decline the surgical option".

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113wSohp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — underdiagnosis, screening, and treatment implications — remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, and screening is critically low and often delayed until years after hypertension has been diagnosed. The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated BP and hypertension suggest screening for PA in all adults with diagnosed hypertension. For treatment, individuals with lateralizing PA can often be cured through unilateral adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral PA typically benefit from mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone or eplerenone, which effectively control BP, alleviate hypokalemia, and mitigate excess cardiovascular risk; however, MRAs are not routinely used as first-line treatments for hypertension, resulting in missed diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for those with undiagnosed PA.

### Biomarkers to guide medical therapy in primary aldosteronism [^116PE1Kd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an endocrinopathy characterized by dysregulated aldosterone production that occurs despite suppression of renin and angiotensin II, and that is non-suppressible by volume and sodium loading. The effectiveness of surgical adrenalectomy for patients with lateralizing PA is characterized by the attenuation of excess aldosterone production leading to blood pressure reduction, correction of hypokalemia, and increases in renin-biomarkers that collectively indicate a reversal of PA pathophysiology and restoration of normal physiology. Even though the vast majority of patients with PA will ultimately be treated medically rather than surgically, there is a lack of guidance on how to optimize medical therapy and on key metrics of success. Herein, we review the evidence justifying approaches to medical management of PA and biomarkers that reflect endocrine principles of restoring normal physiology. We review the current arsenal of medical therapies, including dietary sodium restriction, steroidal and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium channel inhibitors, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors. It is crucial that clinicians recognize that multimodal medical treatment for PA can be highly effective at reducing the risk for adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes when titrated with intention. The key biomarkers reflective of optimized medical therapy are unsurprisingly similar to the physiologic expectations following surgical adrenalectomy: control of blood pressure with the fewest number of antihypertensive agents, normalization of serum potassium without supplementation, and a rise in renin. Pragmatic approaches to achieve these objectives while mitigating adverse effects are reviewed.

Case presentation

A 52-year-old previously healthy woman with no family history of endocrine disease was admitted to our hospital with suspected PA based on high blood pressure (193/105 mmHg), spontaneous hypokalemia (potassium [K], 3.4 mmol/L), and a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR 71 ng/dL per ng/mL/h [plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.2 ng/mL/h and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 14.2 ng/dL]). On admission, the patient showed no clinical features of Cushing syndrome, and no catecholamine excess symptoms other than hypertension, such as headache or excessive sweating. Before the initiation of antihypertensive drugs, PA was confirmed by the positive captopril challenge test (PRA: 0.2 ng/mL/h, PAC: 9.6 ng/dL, ARR: 48 [> 20]; Table 1) according to the Japan Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for PA and the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral adrenal masses (right, 16 × 11 mm; left, 13 × 9 mm), with baseline CT attenuation values of 30–60 Hounsfield units (HU) on the left and 10 HU on the right (Fig. 1, A and B), and contrast-enhanced CT showed a stronger contrast effect in the left adrenal mass than in the right adrenal mass (Fig. 1, C and D). Although overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) showed mild autonomous cortisol secretion (2.25 µg/dL [< 1.8]; Table 1), plasma level of ACTH in the early morning before DST was not suppressed (52.1 pg/mL [> 7.07]; Table 1), and the diurnal variation of serum cortisol was preserved (Table 1). Based on the Japanese Endocrine Society criteria, adrenal subclinical Cushing's syndrome was ruled out. The 24-h urinary catecholamines (epinephrine, 23.7 μg/day [< 41]; norepinephrine, 151.6 μg/day [< 160]; dopamine, 582.1 μg/day [< 1100]) were within normal limits, and the urinary fractionated metanephrines (metanephrine, 0.47 mg/day [< 0.19] and normetanephrine, 0.46 mg/day [< 0.33]) were slightly elevated but did not reach 3-fold of the upper limit of normal range (Table 2). Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) was performed because she requested surgical treatment at that time and the results were interpreted according to previous guidelines. The findings confirmed that the right adrenal gland was responsible for aldosterone hypersecretion (post-cosyntropin stimulation lateralization ratio 24.67 [> 4], contralateral ratio 0.575 [< 1]; Table 3). She refused right adrenalectomy at the last minute, and medical therapy with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, eplerenone (50 mg) was initiated; however, she abruptly discontinued treatment and the follow-up visit. Five years after the first AVS, she visited a local clinic with complaints of headache and high blood pressure (208/109 mmHg) and was administered a calcium blocker (cilnidipine 10 mg). At this time, she requested surgery for PA and was readmitted to our hospital. On admission, her blood pressure was 127/96 mmHg, and she was taking oral cilnidipine 20 mg/day. No symptoms of catecholamine excess or Cushing's signs were observed. Repeated abdominal CT showed no significant change in the right adrenal mass (16 × 11 mm); however, the left adrenal mass was enlarged to 26 × 13 mm (Fig. 1, E and F). At the surgeon's request, AVS was performed a second time to confirm PA localization. The second AVS confirmed the right unilateral hyperaldosteronism (post-cosyntropin stimulation lateralization ratio: 12.60; contralateral suppression index: 0.40) had not changed. (Table 3). Repeated 1mg DST showed mild autonomous cortisol secretion, but the diurnal variation of cortisol was preserved (11:00 pm cortisol: 4.46 µg/dL). The 24-h urinary excretion assay revealed that norepinephrine (142.3 μg/day), epinephrine (26.5 μg/day), and dopamine (644.0 μg/day) levels were normal; however, metanephrine (0.81 mg/day) and normetanephrine (0.60 mg/day) concentrations were higher than those measured 5 years earlier (Table 2). 123 I-MIBG scintigraphy showed a tracer-avid left adrenal mass but no metastatic lesions (Fig. 1, G and H). Based on these findings, a left pheochromocytoma was diagnosed preoperatively. After the temporary discharge, we had a conference with the department of urology of our institution, and we decided to perform partial adrenalectomy for the left pheochromocytoma and medical treatment for the right unilateral PA. The patient was started on α-blocker (doxazosin, 2 mg/day), a non-steroidal MR antagonist (esaxerenone, 5 mg/day), and continued cilnidipine 20 mg/day. Two months later, she was readmitted to our hospital. After preoperative administration of saline (1 L/day) for 7 days and an α-blocker (doxazosin, 2.0 mg/day) for 2 months, laparoscopic left partial adrenalectomy was performed. No intraoperative or postoperative hemodynamic instability occurred. Histologically, the tumor cells were arranged in diffuse sheets or nests and were large with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 2 A). The pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score was 0 indicating a low grade pheochromocytoma. Immunohistochemical examination of the tumor showed that chromogranin A and synaptophysin were positive (Fig. 2, B, C), leading to the final diagnosis of left pheochromocytoma; Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) was positive (Fig. 2 D); cytochrome P450 (CYP) 11B2 was negative, Ki 67 was weakly positive (Fig. 2, E, F), and ACTH was negative (Fig. 3 A). The left adrenal gland tissue adjacent to the tumor was normal (Fig. 3, B-D). Although we could not perform genetic analysis, as consent could not be obtained from the patient, the positive immunostaining for SDHB, suggested against SDH-related paraganglioma syndromes. Doxazosin was discontinued after surgery and esaxerenone (5 mg) and cilnidipine (20 mg) were continued. One month after surgery, the patient's blood pressure was 126/84 mmHg, and her serum K (4.27 mmol/L), PAC (47.38 ng/dL), active renin concentration (ARC) (36.57 μU/mL), and random fractionated urinary metanephrines (metanephrine 152 ng/mg Cr [29–158], normetanephrine 363 ng/mg Cr [122–500]) were normalized. One year after surgery, blood pressure and serum K levels remained well controlled. No surgical treatment for the right adrenal mass has been performed, and pheochromocytoma has not recurred.

Case confirmation

Most guidelines/expert opinions suggest performing one or more confirmatory tests to definitively confirm the diagnosis of PA. These tests are based on the premise that in PA the aldosterone secretion is at least in partially autonomous from renin and therefore angiotensin release. Tests are also justified by the need to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures such as adrenal vein sampling (AVS) or surgery. Commonly performed confirmatory tests comprise the oral sodium loading test, the saline infusion test and the captopril challenge test, and the fludrocortisone salt loading test (Table 4). Tests should be performed according to local expertise and availability and usually require a careful preparation of the patient. In centres where dedicated facilities are not available, oral sodium loading test and captopril challenge tests should be considered since they can be performed in an outpatient setting. Despite the importance usually attributed to confirmatory tests, their use is not evidence-based, as none of the studies supporting their use for diagnosing primary aldosteronism met state-of-the-art criteria for validation of diagnostic tests.

Since 2016 the Endocrine Society Guidelines, recognizing the burden (and perhaps limitations) carried by the confirmatory tests, suggested the possibility of bypassing them in patients with a florid clinical phenotype, e.g. an elevated ARR, high aldosterone concentration (> 20 ng/dL) and spontaneous hypokalaemia. The BIHS also supports the opportunity of considering avoiding confirmatory tests on a case by case basis in subjects unsuitable for washout who have elevated ARR and/or adrenal abnormalities (although this is not evidence based).

For patients who have had ARR measured without pharmacological washout from interfering drugs, it's important to consider clinical features (such as difficulties in controlling hypertension or hypokalemia) alongside biochemical findings.

### Adrenal mass causing secondary hypertension [^112UfmUx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most hypertensive patients have essential (primary) hypertension; only 5% to 10% have a secondary cause. Two clinical characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension are early onset (< 30 years of age) and severe hypertension (> 180/110 mm Hg). When faced with these findings, clinicians should consider a secondary cause of hypertension.

Case Report

A 22-year-old woman being evaluated for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department was noted to have severe persistent hypertension. Additional evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia. The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure management, electrolyte replacement, and further evaluation of presumed hyperaldosteronism. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large adrenal mass. Surgical resection was performed, leading to a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism caused by adrenal carcinoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Secondary hypertension is far less common than essential hypertension; however, considering the large volume of patients seen in emergency departments, it is likely that some will have secondary hypertension. Emergency physicians should be aware of the clinical characteristics that suggest secondary hypertension so that the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways can be pursued.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Secondary hypertension — history, drug-related contributors, and aldosteronism testing — emphasizes that a careful history should be taken with close attention to prescription medications, over-the-counter substances, illicit drugs, and herbal products; that a change in BP may result from drug-drug or drug-food interactions and, when feasible, drugs associated with increased BP should be reduced or discontinued; and that spontaneous hypokalemia is present only in 20% to 50% of patients with primary aldosteronism, so screening should not rely on hypokalemia alone and may require sodium loading to induce aldosterone suppression if plasma screening by the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is inconclusive.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guideline on management of primary aldosteronism [^115G8bsa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a leading endocrine cause of secondary hypertension.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on managing PA.

Data Source

MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and others were searched on October 4, 2024.

Study Selection

Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers.

Data Synthesis

We included 95 studies (7 randomized trials and 88 observational studies). We did not identify trials that evaluated the outcomes of PA screening. One observational study suggested that screening was associated with higher rates of using PA-specific medical therapies and better blood pressure control. Patients managed with adrenal venous sampling (vs computed tomography alone) may have a better post-adrenalectomy biochemical cure rate, but with an increased risk of adrenal hemorrhage. Two small observational studies suggested that PA-specific medical or surgical therapy was likely associated with better blood pressure control than nonspecific therapy. Small randomized trials suggested that surgical therapy may be associated with better blood pressure control than medical therapy, with a lower number and dosage of antihypertensive medications. Compared to eplerenone, spironolactone may be associated with better control of hypokalemia and a lower number and dosage of antihypertensive agents. Unsuppressed plasma renin activity was associated with better control of hypokalemia, while suppression was associated with higher risk of mortality, atrial fibrillation, and stroke (very low certainty).

Conclusion

This systematic review addresses various aspects of managing PA and will support the development of the Endocrine Society guidelines.

### Is It possible to screen for primary aldosteronism effectively in primary care? [^113fgcp8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

All individuals who underwent ARR testing via primary care between 2008 and 2022 were identified from the biochemistry laboratory sample database. Electronic patient records were screened to identify if referral to secondary care had occurred and if so, what the final outcome was. Where an individual had more than one ARR in primary care, the most recent test before secondary care assessment was included in the analysis. Where an individual had more than 1 secondary care ARR, the most recent test, before saline infusion test or before implementation of definitive treatment, was included in the analysis.

A saline infusion test for confirmation of PA was performed in secondary care. It was conducted in the morning, whilst the patient was seated in a semi‐reclined chair. In line with Endocrine Society guidelines for diagnosis and management of PA, diagnosis of PA was considered confirmed (confirmed PA) in the following scenarios:
– aldosterone level ≥ 280 pmol/L post‐saline infusion test, OR
– aldosterone raised above 550 pmol/L, undetectable renin and spontaneous hypokalaemia OR
– aldosterone level 140–279 pmol/L post‐saline infusion test with strong clinical suspicion of PA, completed further evaluation and appropriate management.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: novel approaches and future outlooks [^1149UBa9]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
The traditional approach to the diagnosis and management of patients with PA: Initial diagnosis is determined by a positive aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) screen with at least 1 positive confirmatory test (discussed in "Screening, Diagnosis, and the Spectrum of Disease"). Following diagnosis, subtype diagnosis (ie, lateralization) is sought through use of adrenal imaging/adrenal vein sampling (AVS) (discussed in "Current Approach to Lateralization"). Unilateral disease is commonly treated with adrenalectomy of the diseased adrenal whereas in cases of bilateral disease, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists are commonly prescribed (discussed in "Advances in Pharmacotherapy").

Figure 2.
Outline of current "roadblocks" in primary aldosteronism (PA) care, with suggested approaches to addressing these, including: 1. Improved screening for, and diagnosis of PA through application of metabolomics and machine learning; 2. Utilization of advanced lateralization techniques including molecular (functional) imaging to permit precise tumor localization; 3. Use of focal adrenal-sparing interventions (eg, adrenal-sparing surgery or thermal ablation) where appropriate; 4. Continued development of more selective pharmacological agents. Figure created with.

Overall, screening rates for PA are low. In spite of Endocrine Society and American Heart Association guidelines, a population-based retrospective cohort study in Canada reported a screening rate of only 3.9% of all patients with hypokalemia (K + < 3.0 mEq/L) and hypertension, and 1% of patients who were on 4 or more antihypertensive agents. Screening was higher for patients attending a cardiologist, endocrinologist, or nephrologist. European data, collected from patient cohorts in Germany and Italy where there is higher awareness of PA, still observed screening rates within a primary care setting that were < 8%. These findings are important because the diagnosis and management of hypertension is mostly undertaken in primary care or by generalists and it is important therefore to understand the roadblocks to screening among these professionals (Fig. 2).

Primary aldosteronism — adrenal venous sampling exception and perioperative cortisol: A potential exception to needing adrenal venous sampling exists when the diagnosis of unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) is so likely that AVS could be considered unnecessary (eg, individual age < 35 years with marked primary aldosteronism with hypokalemia and a > 1.0-cm unilateral adrenal adenoma on CT scanning), and adrenal venous sampling may help lateralize both aldosterone and cortisol secretion; it will also be important to measure early morning cortisol following adrenal surgery and prepare for a period of possible glucocorticoid insufficiency.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), ES 2025 guidelines recommend to repeat the test on a different day if the patient's initial screen is negative and the pretest probability of PA is moderate to high, such as in cases of hypokalemia and/or resistant hypertension, or if renin is suppressed with aldosterone levels of 5–10 ng/dL (138–277 pmol/L) by immunoassay.

### A clinical prediction score for diagnosing unilateral primary aldosteronism may not be generalizable [^1139aBZ3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension with a 4–20% prevalence. Using population-based screening, the underlying pathology is most frequently bilateral adrenal hyperplasia followed by unilateral aldosterone producing adenoma; less often, unilateral hyperplasia is also found. Diagnosis involves screening patients with an aldosterone renin ratio (ARR) followed by a confirmatory test, if appropriate. Subsequently, computerized tomography (CT) of the adrenal glands can identify an adenoma as a source of aldosterone excess, though CT lacks sensitivity and specificity for unilateral PA. It has been suggested that PA patients less than 40 years of age with a ≥ 1 cm unilateral adrenal adenoma could be directed to unilateral adrenalectomy without adrenal vein sampling (AVS). This approach applies to just 10% of patients with PA. Those over 40 years of age with an adenoma or those with no imaging findings would be directed towards AVS to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral PA. However, issues with AVS exist including lack of availability; technical procedural performance issues, especially when performed at lower volume centres; and possible risk of complications.

A need exists, then, for a clinical prediction score (CPS) that predicts unilateral PA for a larger proportion of patients. A published CPS found 100% specificity for the identification of unilateral aldosterone excess in patients with confirmed PA in a retrospective analysis of patients 87 patients. The predictive factors included an adrenal adenoma measuring ≥ 8 mm; hypokalemia (potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/liter); and evidence of aldosterone-induced hyperfiltration with an increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using the modified diet in renal disease equation. Each factor contributed a weighted number of points to the overall CPS with a maximum of 7 points for a patient with all three features (Table 1). A CPS of ≥ 5 was associated with 100% specificity for unilateral PA. If this CPS were to be validated and the 100% specificity confirmed, practitioners would be able to confidently refer 30% of patients with PA and an imaged adenoma for surgical management without having AVS. Two subsequent analysis of this CPS applied to different databases could not replicate the 100% specificity with performance characteristics of 38.8% specificity and 88.5% specificity and sensitivity of 46% and a specificity of 80%. The present study aimed to determine the validity of the CPS in a separate cohort of patients.

### Characterization of resistant hypertension… [^1111NGiu]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results Plasma aldosterone, aldosterone to renin ratio, 24-hour UAldo, brain-type natriuretic peptide, and atrial natriuretic peptide values were higher and plasma renin activity and serum potassium values were lower in patients with resistant hypertension vs controls. Recent studies indicate that primary aldosteronism is a common cause of resistant hypertension. A study8 of 88 consecutive patients with resistant hypertension reported a 20% prevalence of PA. Biochemical evaluation was performed for all the patients on an outpatient basis.

Early morning blood samples were collected from patients in the seated position for serum chemistry results, plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. In contrast, only 4% of controls had an elevated ratio with the use of either plasma or urinary aldosterone levels. The ANP and BNP values were incrementally higher in patients with a high aldosterone status vs patients with a normal aldosterone status vs controls. The PRA levels were lower in patients with resistant hypertension despite widespread use of agents known to increase PRA, and serum potassium levels were also lower, perhaps as a consequence of greater diuretic use or higher aldosterone levels.

Although previous studies, including our own, have reported a prevalence of PA of approximately 20% in patients with resistant hypertension, none specifically compared aldosterone levels in a control group. In the present study, we make such a comparison and confirm overall higher levels of plasma and 24-hour urinary aldosterone in patients with resistant hypertension.

### Respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis caused by severe hypokalemia in a young female with hypertension: a rare critical condition in primary aldosteronism [^111rrRaC]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the severe signs and symptoms of our patient, including respiratory failure and extremity weakness, one would expect very high serum aldosterone values (at least more than 20 or 30 ng/dL). The lower-than-expected value of serum aldosterone in our case might be due to severe hypokalemia (serum potassium: 2.1 mEq/L) at the time of aldosterone and renin estimation.

The first step to identifying the subtype and ruling out adrenal carcinoma is an adrenal CT scan. Although a CT scan is very useful for diagnosis and treatment decisions, it has some limitations. In a study by Young et al. 21.7% of patients would have been wrongly excluded from being considered for adrenalectomy, and 24.7% of patients might have undergone unnecessary or inappropriate adrenalectomy. In a systematic review by Kempers et al. CT/MRI misdiagnosed the cause of primary aldosteronism in 37.8% of patients compared to adrenal venous sampling as the standard test. Therefore, adrenal venous sampling has been suggested as an essential diagnostic tool for patients with a potential surgical therapeutic plan. Notably, based on Dekkers et al. there is no significant difference between the therapeutic outcomes of CT-based and adrenal venous sampling-based diagnoses. Still, this subject is controversial and needs further assessment. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has no advantage over CT in subtype evaluation. Moreover, MRI is more expensive and has less spatial resolution than a CT scan. Unfortunately, we did not have the resources to perform adrenal venous sampling in our patient, which was a limitation of our report.

### Genetic causes of primary aldosteronism [^1161rRLN]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In 1955, Conn reported a patient with hypertension, muscular weakness, paralysis, polydipsia, polyuria, and hypokalemic alkalosis who was cured after removal of a 4 cm adrenocortical adenoma (benign tumor of the adrenal cortex). He described this as a new syndrome of "primary aldosteronism" (PA). Currently, PA is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for up to 6% of hypertensive patients in primary care and up to 11% of patients in specialized referral centers; its prevalence increases with the severity of hypertension. PA is characterized by at least partially autonomous aldosterone production (despite low renin levels), hypertension and low or normal serum potassium levels. Common causes, include idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA; approximately 60% of the cases) and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA; approximately 30%), and rare subforms include unilateral hyperplasia, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), or familial hyperaldosteronism (FH). PA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation compared with primary hypertension –. In patients with hypertension, an elevated aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) is used as a screening parameter, followed by confirmatory testing (salt loading, fludrocortisone or captopril administration, which all fail to sufficiently lower aldosterone levels in PA). Imaging, such as computed tomography, serves to exclude malignancy, whereas so-called adrenal venous sampling, an invasive procedure, is typically required to distinguish unilateral (mostly APA) from bilateral (usually IHA) aldosterone production. However, adrenal venous sampling remains challenging, and hence, many patients are not diagnosed or treated optimally. While APAs can potentially be cured by surgery, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists remain the treatment of choice for IHA.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) screening outcomes — after the widespread adoption of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) in hypertension, identification of PA increased 5- to 15-fold. Only between 9% and 37% of individuals had hypokalemia, and across three prospective studies totaling 5797 individuals, only 25% to 30% of those with confirmed PA had hypokalemia. In a study of 95 individuals with lateralizing PA, more than 90% had suppressed renin preoperatively, whereas 62% to 67% had hypokalemia requiring potassium supplementation preoperatively. The ARR was effective at screening for PA, and most cases were ultimately diagnosed with bilateral PA.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^113Kcs9N]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — aldosterone–renin ratio and diagnostic thresholds: Use of the plasma aldosterone: renin ratio is recommended when adults are screened for primary aldosteronism (COR I, LOE C-LD). Primary aldosteronism is present in up to 20% of individuals with resistant hypertension. The guideline suggests that a plasma aldosterone concentration should be as low as 10 ng/dL in order for a given ratio to be determined positive, which is considered potentially indicative when collected in a supine position at the end of a 2-L saline suppression test. Clinically, many clinicians do not apply the ratio unless a seated aldosterone level is > 16 ng/dL without saline suppression. In the setting of hypokalemia, a plasma aldosterone level > 20 ng/dL and a renin level below detection basically confirm the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113LLKPj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Pre–adrenal venous sampling (AVS) preparation and exceptions: For accurate interpretation of AVS, potassium should be normal and renin suppressed; blood pressure should be well controlled, and antihypertensive agents do not interfere with AVS as long as renin is low. If renin is not suppressed, changes in the antihypertensive regimen should be considered before AVS, and drugs with minimal effect on renin may include selective α1-receptor antagonists and calcium-channel blockers. There are 4 exceptions to the suggested requirement for AVS prior to surgery, including most young individuals (eg, age < 35 years) with marked PA — spontaneous hypokalemia, plasma aldosterone concentration > 30 ng/dL by immunoassay or > 22.5 ng/dL by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), suppressed renin — and a unilateral adrenal mass with cortical adenoma features on computed tomography (CT); adrenal cortical adenomas are very uncommon in individuals aged < 35 years (0.28%), and in such young individuals with marked PA and a > 1.0-cm unilateral adrenal nodule on CT, unilateral adrenalectomy without prior AVS can be considered.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Z3tES]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — aldosterone suppression testing after a positive screen: In individuals who screen positive for primary aldosteronism (PA), we suggest aldosterone suppression testing when screening suggests an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA and individualized decision making supports pursuing surgical eligibility (2 ⊕⊕OO). Testing may be helpful in individuals with an intermediate probability of lateralizing PA who are willing and able to undergo surgical adrenalectomy. It is not required prior to initiating PA-specific therapy for individuals with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production; in the presence of clear evidence of severe autonomous aldosterone production — defined by direct renin concentration (DRC) < 2 mU/L or plasma renin activity (PRA) < 0.2 ng/mL/h with plasma aldosterone concentration > 20 ng/dL by immunoassay or > 15 ng/dL by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry — aldosterone suppression testing is not recommended. Individuals unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling (AVS) and adrenalectomy can be empirically treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) based on screening results without suppression testing, and testing is unnecessary in families with hyperaldosteronism; genetic screening is recommended for all first-degree relatives and for individuals with apparent onset PA (< 20 years).

### Left adrenal aldosteronism coexisting with left paraaortic paraganglioma presenting as bilateral adrenal and left paraaortic tumors-comprehensive adrenal evaluation aiding perfect management: a case report [^114eSc9L]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 44-year-old male patient presented with years of hypertension (since 2012) and received regular follow-up and medical treatment at a cardiovascular outpatient clinic. Some nonspecific symptoms, including chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and bilateral leg weakness, were described. Neither headache nor sweating was complained. According to the guidelines from the National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, indications for evaluation of secondary hypertension include resistant hypertension, age of onset before puberty, age younger than 30 years with nonobesity and no family history, malignant hypertension, or acute rise of blood pressure in previous stable readings. Therefore, a more detailed assessment of the possible underlying cause of the hypertension was not done between 2012–2016. It was not until 2016 that hypokalemia was first noted. From 2016 to 2019, there were episodes of recurrent hypokalemia despite potassium supplementation. The potassium level was approximately 3.1 mmol/L (normal, 3.5–5.1 mmol/L) with a high potassium diet during 2016–2018 but decreased to 2.7 mmol/L in 2018. Hypokalemia-associated drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, were then discontinued. However, the potassium level dropped to 2.3 mmol/L in 2019, and intravenous potassium supplementation was given twice. To investigate the cause of hypokalemia, several blood and urinary examinations were performed. A trans-tubular potassium gradient of 10.5 (> 7) and urine potassium/creatinine ratio of 68 (> 1.5) indicated renal loss of potassium. Venous gas analysis reported metabolic alkalosis, which ruled out renal tubular acidosis or other causes of metabolic acidosis. Given renal potassium loss accompanied by refractory hypertension, hyperaldosteronism was therefore suspected. Elevated plasma aldosterone levels of 489 pg/ml (normal, 68.0–173.0 pg/ml), low plasma renin concentrations of 2.89 pg/ml (normal, 1.1–20.2 pg/ml), and elevated aldosterone renin ratios (ARRs) of 169.2 were strongly indicated primary aldosteronism. Further abdominal computed tomography incidentally found bilateral adrenal tumors (right: 1.2 cm, left: 2.1 cm) and a left para-aortic tumor (4.3 cm), with the Hounsfield unit of the para-aortic tumor being approximately 40 under the noncontrast phase and 70 under the arterial phase, which suggested many possibilities (Fig. 1). Upon referral to the surgical outpatient clinic, his blood pressure was approximately 155/105 mmHg with receiving three types of antihypertensives, including calcium channel blocker/angiotensin receptor blocker (amlodipine/valsartan (5/80 mg) 1# bid, nifedipine (10 mg) 1# prn) and an alpha blocker (doxazosin (4 mg) 1# qd). Reviewing his family history, no endocrine disorders were identified. To clarify the nature of the bilateral adrenal tumors, comprehensive adrenal hormone tests were performed, including serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODST), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and 24-h urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and catecholamines. The results showed normal cortisol levels of 12.6 µg/dl (normal, 2.9–17.3 µg/dl), ACTH levels of 34.5 pg/ml (normal, 7.2–63.3 pg/ml), DHEA levels of 1464 ng/ml (normal, 215–2769 ng/ml), suppressive ODST tests of cortisol levels < 1 µg/dl (normal, < 1.8 μg/dl), mildly elevated 24-h urine VMA levels of 8.61 mg/day (normal, 1–7.5 mg/day), norepinephrine levels of 105.0 µg/day (normal, 12.1–85.5 µg/day), and normal epinephrine levels of 16.5 µg/day (normal, 0–22.4 µg/day). Metanephrine and normetanephrine were not available in our lab. Mild elevation of 24-h urine VMA and catecholamines suggested more possibilities for both adrenal and para-aortic lesions that could be para-aortic PGL, unilateral or bilateral pheochromocytoma (although less likely), or neither.

Renin as a biomarker during primary aldosteronism–specific medical therapy: Although aldosterone-directed medical therapy has been beneficial in PA, the optimal dosing and surveillance remain uncertain, and whether renin should guide treatment has been considered by prior studies and consensus groups. Because PA is characterized and diagnosed by aldosterone overproduction despite suppression of renin and angiotensin II, a rise in renin induced by aldosterone-directed medical therapy should reflect reversal of PA pathophysiology that may portend improved clinical outcomes.

### Testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with… [^1121Xpge]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of primary aldosteronism is notable in young adults with hypertension, patients with atrial fibrillation, and in those with hypertension and concomitant hypokalemia. However, only about 2% of patients undergo appropriate testing for primary aldosteronism. Compared with patients with essential hypertension, those with primary aldosteronism vs essential hypertension are more likely to experience stroke, coronary artery disease, proteinuria, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. Testing for primary aldosteronism is recommended in patients with resistant hypertension, as well as patients with controlled hypertension and any of the following: atrial fibrillation, adrenal nodule, family history of stroke at younger than 40 years of age, hypokalemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and/or a first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism.

The 2025 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults reaffirms tests in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of the presence of hypokalemia. Some studies have demonstrated that less than 50% of patients with primary hypoaldosteronism had hypokalemia on laboratory testing, making it a less sensitive marker of the disease and supporting the new recommendations. A recent guideline on Primary Aldosteronism by the Endocrine Society takes it a step further, recommending that all patients with hypertension undergo testing for primary aldosteronism. Testing for primary aldosteronism comprises measuring serum aldosterone and renin to calculate the ratio between the two. Screening is recommended in the morning, and the patient should not restrict sodium for a couple of days before testing.

Assessing the level of potassium at the same time is helpful to interpret if the aldosterone level is appropriately compensating for the potassium level. Additionally, a positive response to treatment with spironolactone with improved blood pressure control can help support the diagnosis. Importantly, testing for aldosterone and renin can be influenced by a variety of factors, making repeat testing sometimes necessary. Medications such as beta or alpha-2 blockers may falsely lower renin levels. Levels of aldosterone and renin may also be influenced by the presence of chronic renal disease, among other factors. Recommendations to minimize medication withholding and potential medication substitutes can be found in a table in the Endocrine Society guideline.

Overall summary of recommendations

Use plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) as screening test for PA.
Consider discontinuing β-adrenergic blockers and centrally acting drugs before performing ARR.
Withdrawal of all antihypertensive medications for ARR screening is not routinely recommended.
When assessing ARR consider confounding factors such as sodium intake, hypokalaemia and drug treatment.
Interpret the ARR using the cut off values in Table 3, unless subjects are on drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), in which case consider the individual components of the ARR — e.g. a normal ARR but suppressed renin whilst on drugs expected to increase renin does not exclude PA.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening and management notes that when suspicion remains despite negative or borderline results, potentially interfering medications may be temporarily substituted with noninterfering medications for at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to repeat testing. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism may require an aldosterone suppression test such as an intravenous saline suppression test or oral salt-loading test. If primary aldosteronism is confirmed, imaging of the adrenal glands should be considered, even if treatment will be with medication, to exclude a large adrenal mass that may require adrenalectomy if features suggestive of malignancy are present (size > 4 cm, imaging characteristics). Treating primary aldosteronism, either with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) or unilateral adrenalectomy, if indicated, is associated with resolution of hypokalemia, lower BP, fewer number of antihypertensive medications required, and improved parameters of impaired cardiac and kidney function, and meta-analysis of observational data suggests that adrenalectomy may be associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with medical therapy.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: novel approaches and future outlooks [^117PJN7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Current challenges in screening

PA is underdiagnosed and undertreated in current clinical practice, where screening and diagnosis are the principal challenges that limit effective management (traditional diagnosis/treatment workflow for PA highlighted in Figs. 1 and Figs. 2). Overall, there is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals, within either primary or secondary care settings. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at risk" patients for PA. Screening under these recommendations should be carried out using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) with particular attention paid to those with (1) severe hypertension; (2) hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia; (3) an adrenal mass; (4) sleep apnea; (5) a family history of early-onset hypertension; (6) stroke at a young age; or (7) a first-degree relative who has PA. American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, align with the Endocrine Society guidelines in terms of recognized risk factors which should trigger screening for PA; in contrast, European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidance do not emphasize the need to screen for PA except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (approximately 5% of all patients). Some national guidelines for the management of hypertension, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### Severe hyperkalemia following adrenalectomy for aldosteronoma: prediction, pathogenesis and approach to clinical management-a case series [^117VJnTU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Case 1

A 51 year old woman with a 12 year history of hypertension developed hypokalemia (as low as 2.2 mmol/L). Her blood pressure was controlled with amlodipine 10 mg once daily and she received potassium supplements to maintain eukalemia. Her serum aldosterone was 2832 pmol/l with undetectable plasma renin activity. Her aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) was therefore estimated at greater than 28,000 pmol/l/ng/ml/h (normal less than 2000 using renin activity of 0.1 ng/ml/h to avoid over-inflation). Her serum creatinine was 75 umol/l with eGFR of 85 ml/min. Abdominal CT showed a 3.5 cm low density left adrenal mass and adrenal vein sampling confirmed left lateralization with lateralization index values of 23:1 and 28:1 pre and post cosyntropin infusion. She underwent left adrenalectomy for what was reported as a 15.6 g adrenocortical adenoma on pathology. The post-operative biochemical course is presented in Table 1. At 2 weeks post-operative follow up, her blood pressure was 124/80, serum potassium 4.5 mmol/L and serum creatinine 52 umol/l without any medications. Her serum aldosterone was less than 70 pmol/l and renin activity of 0.36 ng/ml/h yielding ARR less than 194. However, at 6 weeks post-operative, she presented with serum potassium of 6.7 mmol/l, serum creatinine of 152 umol/l associated with persistent diarrhea (determined to be non-infectious) and clinical volume depletion. After fluid resuscitation she was started on fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily and up-titrated to 0.1 mg bid over a 1-week period. At the higher fludrocortisone dose she became normokalemic and her serum creatinine decreased to 134 umol/l (Table 1). One month later, her serum potassium continued to be 4.8 mmol/l and serum creatinine 112 umol/l and so a dose reduction in fludrocortisone was attempted but at 0.1 mg per day, her potassium promptly rose to 5.6 mmol/l with creatinine 140 umol/l. Hyperkalemia persisted in the fluid replete state. She was not on any medications causing hyperkalemia. In the context for fludrocortisone responsive hyperkalemia we did not calculate TTKG (trans tubular potassium gradient). The fludrocortisone dose was increased again with similar normalization of potassium and drop in serum creatinine but her resultant blood pressures rose to 160/100.

### Diagnostic value of the post-captopril test in primary aldosteronism [^116fmomn]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is a disorder with hypertension, hypokalemia, increased plasma aldosterone, and suppressed renin activity. A random plasma aldosterone/renin activity (PA/PRA) > 65 (conventional units ratio [CUR] > 30) has been proposed as a screening test. We have retrospectively determined the value of the post-captopril plasma aldosterone/renin activity (CAPT PA/PRA) test for the diagnosis of patients with primary aldosteronism whose PA/PRA was < 65. We considered the CAPT PA/PRA test to be positive for primary aldosteronism if either the plasma aldosterone concentration did not drop below 0.33 nmol/L (12 ng/dL) or the ratio was > 26 (CUR > 12). We found 6 patients with a random PA/PRA of 21 to 60 (CUR 10 to 28), yet with an abnormal post-captopril test criteria for primary aldosteronism. Five had an abnormal saline suppression test, and all 6 were confirmed by a combination of diagnostic localization with computerized axial tomography, iodocholesterol scan, adrenal venous sampling, and/or surgery. Four had idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, and 2 had an aldosterone-producing adenoma. One other patient had an abnormal random plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio of 99 (CUR 46), a negative saline infusion study, and was determined to have essential hypertension. In summary, the CAPT PA/PRA, but not the random PA/PRA, correctly diagnosed 6 patients with primary aldosteronism in our institution. An additional patient with essential hypertension was incorrectly diagnosed as having primary aldosteronism by the PA/PRA test. We conclude that the simple addition of 25 mg of captopril, taken orally 2 hours before sampling, enhances the accuracy for diagnosing patients with primary aldosteronism.

### Response to letter to the editor from singhania et al.: "Increasing incidence of primary aldosteronism in Western Sweden during 3 decades-yet an underdiagnosed disorder" [^116B14Fm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor,

We thank Dr Pankaj Singhania and Dr Rana Bhattacharjee for their comments on our recently published study. In the study we identified patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) by searching for the diagnostic codes for the disease in the national Swedish Patient Registry and not by biochemical screening. Indeed, we agree that screening for PA in all patients with hypertension is probably not cost-effective and should instead be performed in specific subgroups of patients in accordance with the clinical guidelines from the Endocrine Society.

We also agree that the prevalence of hypokalemia in our cohort was surprisingly high (79%). This probably illustrates that most patients diagnosed with PA during the study period had a severe phenotype, and patients with milder disease remain underdiagnosed. This is unfortunate since patients with a severe phenotype are more likely to already have developed secondary cardiovascular disease and/or impaired renal function, that can be prevented by earlier detection and adequate treatment.

Between 2007 and 2016, PA was confirmed with a saline infusion test in 87% of our cohort. This is in line with the clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society published in 2008 that recommended a confirmatory test in all patients with a positive aldosterone-renin ratio. However, in the updated version of the guidelines, published in 2016, it was suggested that confirmatory test may not be necessary in patients with plasma aldosterone > 550 pmol/L, low plasma renin, and spontaneous hypokalemia. Recently, this recommendation received further support in a study including more than 500 patients with PA, finding that one-third of the patients could bypass a confirmatory test without jeopardizing the diagnostic accuracy. Thus, in the future, a substantial number of patients with hypertension and a pathological aldosterone-renin ratio should be able to proceed directly to a subtype classification without a confirmatory test.

A pooled sensitivity and specificity of adrenal imaging for identifying unilateral PA in a recent meta-analysis, including 4669 subjects from 25 studies, was 68% and 57%, respectively. In fact, by using adrenal imaging for deciding treatment, 15% of patients would inappropriately be considered to be candidates for adrenalectomy, 19% would not be adequately offered surgical treatment, and in 4% adrenalectomy on the wrong side would be performed. Therefore, in our opinion, adrenal vein sampling is necessary to determine laterality in patients with PA, even in patients aged 40 years or younger.

Secondary hypertension — primary aldosteronism: Indications for additional testing include resistant hypertension; hypertension with hypokalemia (spontaneous or diuretic induced); hypertension with muscle cramps or weakness; hypertension with incidentally discovered adrenal mass; hypertension with obstructive sleep apnea; or hypertension with family history of early-onset hypertension or stroke. Physical findings can include arrhythmias with hypokalemia, especially AF. Screening uses electrolytes and a plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio, and confirmatory options include oral sodium loading test, IV saline infusion test, or captopril suppression test, with adrenal CT scan and adrenal vein sampling as part of evaluation.

### A comprehensive review of the clinical aspects of primary aldosteronism [^111iW9bQ]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is much more common than previously thought. The high prevalence of primary aldosteronism, the damage this condition does to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys (which causes a high rate of cardiovascular events), along with the notion that a timely diagnosis followed by an appropriate therapy can correct the arterial hypertension and hypokalemia, justify efforts to search for primary aldosteronism in many patients with hypertension. Most centers can use a cost-effective strategy to screen for patients with primary aldosteronism. By contrast, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, which involves adrenal-vein sampling, should only be undertaken at tertiary referral centers that have experience in performing and interpreting this test. The identification of a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be beneficial for the patient. In some subgroups of patients with hypertension who are at high risk of primary aldosteronism or can benefit most from an accurate diagnosis, an aggressive diagnostic approach is necessary.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism: practical clinical perspectives [^114d3Hy6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most common form of secondary hypertension, can be either surgically cured or treated with targeted pharmacotherapy. PA is frequently undiagnosed and untreated, leading to aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and nephrotoxicity. Thus, clinicians should perform case detection testing for PA at least once in all patients with hypertension. Confirmatory testing is indicated in most patients with positive case detection testing results. The next step is to determine whether patients with confirmed PA have a disease that can be cured with surgery or whether it should be treated medically; this step is guided by computed tomography scan of the adrenal glands and adrenal venous sampling. With appropriate surgical expertise, laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy is safe, efficient and curative in patients with unilateral adrenal disease. In patients who have bilateral aldosterone hypersecretion, the optimal management is a low-sodium diet and lifelong treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist administered at a dosage to maintain a high-normal serum potassium concentration without the aid of oral potassium supplements.

Screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) in hypertension — recommendation and implementation: The panel "suggests PA screening for individuals with hypertension based on the high prevalence of PA, its underdiagnosis, and the potential to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through targeted treatment", emphasizing that "this is a conditional recommendation". Evidence gaps are noted as "No direct comparative studies between screening and no screening were identified for critical clinical outcomes". Implementation is context dependent: "This is a conditional recommendation, and its implementation will vary depending on contextual factors at both the health-care system and clinician–patient levels". Resource constraints are highlighted: "Availability of laboratories to conduct aldosterone, renin, and potassium testing, as well as capacity for downstream evaluations such as aldosterone suppression testing, adrenal imaging, or AVS, varies widely", and "In settings where advanced diagnostics or specialist services are limited, alternative approaches — such as empiric MRA therapy following a positive screening result — may be appropriate".

### Diagnosing secondary hypertension… [^1154rXwE]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosis: ABCDE A: ACCURACY, APNEA, ALDOSTERONISM. 10 The resulting retention of excess salt and water suppresses renin levels. Increased urinary excretion of potassium signals hyperal-dosteronism, which should be suspected in all hypertensive patients with unprovoked hypokalemia. 11 The next diagnostic test should be demonstration of an elevated ratio of plasma aldosterone levels to plasma renin activity.
12. Bad Kidneys Renal parenchymal disease can be a cause or consequence of hypertension. Progressive renal damage is caused by the mechanical and humoral effects of glomerular hypertension. The renal damage decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete salt and excess fluid, and the hypertension worsens.

As renal damage progresses, hyperparathyroidism develops and erythropoietin production increases, exacerbating the hypertension. 5, 18 Thus, a vicious cycle of worsening renal function and hypertension begins. Aggressive treatment of hypertension in patients with renal parenchymal disease can lower the blood pressure and slow the disease's progression, although it is difficult to effectively control hypertension in chronic renal disease. Early treatment of hypertension and diabetes, the two most common causes of end-stage renal disease, can lower the incidence of long-term renal complications. 18 Diagnosis is based on loss of renal cortical function, although it may be impossible to tell if the renal dysfunction is primary or secondary to the hypertension. 2 C: CATECHOLAMINES, COARCTATION, CUSHING'S SYNDROME.

Hyperparathyroidism is a potentially reversible cause of hypertension. Its incidence in hypertensive patients is about 1 percent, compared with a 0. 1 percent incidence in the general population. 29 However, only 30 to 40 percent of patients with hyperparathyroidism have hypertension, and parathyroidectomy does not reliably resolve hypertension in patients with this disorder. 29 It is unclear how hyperparathyroidism increases blood pressure, because there is no direct correlation with parathyroid hormone or calcium levels.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — diagnostic steps and management: If screening results are negative or borderline in patients in whom there is a high level of suspicion for primary aldosteronism and confirmation of the diagnosis will change management, potentially interfering medications may be temporarily substituted with noninterfering medications (ie, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCBs], vasodilators, peripheral alpha-blockers, and potentially dihydropyridine CCBs) for at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to repeat testing. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism may require an aldosterone suppression test such as an intravenous (IV) saline suppression test or oral salt-loading test. If the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is confirmed and the patient agrees that surgery would be desirable, the patient is referred for an adrenal venous sampling procedure to determine whether the increased aldosterone production is unilateral or bilateral in origin; if unilateral excess aldosterone production is documented on adrenal venous sampling, the patient is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, whereas if bilaterally increased aldosterone secretion is present or if the patient is not a surgical candidate or is not interested in pursuing surgery, the patient is treated with an MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone). If primary aldosteronism is confirmed, imaging of the adrenal glands should be considered, even if treatment will be with medication, to exclude a large adrenal mass that may require adrenalectomy if features suggestive of malignancy are present (size > 4 cm, imaging characteristics). Treating primary aldosteronism, either with an MRA or unilateral adrenalectomy, if indicated, is associated with resolution of hypokalemia, lower BP, fewer number of antihypertensive medications required, and improved parameters of impaired cardiac and kidney function, and meta-analysis of observational data suggests that adrenalectomy may be associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with medical therapy.

Screening for primary aldosteronism in individuals with hypertension — recommendation and technical steps: We recommend primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). Screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Potassium should be measured alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself, but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as a low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to within the laboratory reference range and screening should be repeated. Manage interfering medications depending on individual safety and feasibility, and the Guideline Development Panel outlined both minimal-withdrawal and no-withdrawal strategies of interfering medications before screening. A positive screen meets both of the following in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed and aldosterone is inappropriately high relative to renin.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperaldosteronism [^111A8a9f]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperaldosteronism is an important and increasingly prevalent cause of hypertension that is characterized by unregulated aldosterone excess. More than 90% of primary hyperaldosteronism cases are attributable to either idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia or aldosterone-producing adenomas. The approach to the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism should be step-wise, starting with screening of at-risk populations, confirmatory testing for positively screened patients, and subtype classification in order to direct surgical or medical management. Based on current guidelines, subtype classification of primary hyperaldosteronism should be determined with both imaging and adrenal vein sampling (AVS), reserving deferment of AVS for a selective subset of patients.

Diagnostic workup

There are three cardinal pathophysiologic features of PA firstly described by Conn and colleagues that still influence our diagnostic approach:
An autonomous aldosterone production suppressing plasma renin.
A blunted renin response to stimulation (such as administering an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)).
Lack of aldosterone suppression by volume expansion.

The diagnosis of PA requires demonstration of a low or undetectable renin level, plasma aldosterone concentration that is inappropriately high for salt and volume status and a confirmatory test to demonstrate that aldosterone secretion is unresponsive to manoeuvres that perturbate renin production. Thus, the diagnosis of PA usually requires a two-step approach and subtype evaluation (Fig. 1):

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is the most common endocrine cause of hypertension, characterized by autonomous aldosterone hormone production from the adrenal glands. It encompasses a wide spectrum of renin-independent aldosterone production with diverse histopathological etiologies. A vast majority of PA is caused by bilateral disease, remains underdiagnosed and is linked to serious cardiometabolic risks. This review outlines our current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of PA, and provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic strategies and management of PA.

### Primary aldosteronism and aldosterone-associated hypertension [^116fkrDM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The field of primary aldosteronism (PA) and aldosterone-related hypertension has undergone rapid evolution. From a relatively rare curiosity PA has become a common problem particularly in selected hypertensive populations. Patients with PA and aldosterone-related hypertension appear to be at higher cardiovascular and renal risk than comparable patients with essential hypertension probably due to the pleiotropic effects of aldosterone. Aldosterone is also linked to metabolic syndrome and diabetes. The aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) has allowed the widespread screening for PA, but the exact cut-off values may vary in different population groups. All patients with hypertension and hypokalaemia, and young patients with hypertension, hypertension with an incidental adrenal mass, and severe or resistant hypertension should be screened. The use of the ARR to screen all hypertensives for PA is controversial as the test lacks specificity and many patients with false-positive tests will undergo complex and expensive testing to confirm the diagnosis. The fludrocortisone suppression test, the saline infusion test or 24-hour aldosterone excretion may be used to confirm PA in patients with a positive ARR. Adrenal venous sampling is the most reliable test to detect the presence of an aldosterone-producing adenoma, but spiral CT scan or adrenocortical scintigraphy may be useful in centres without facilities for adrenal venous sampling. Spironolactone is emerging as an important antihypertensive agent in patients with resistant hypertension and aldosterone-related hypertension. The ARR may be a useful guide to drug selection in hypertensives patients, but further research is needed to make more definitive recommendations.

A few simple rules can allow physicians to successfully identify many patients with arterial hypertension caused by PA among the so-called essential hypertensive patients. The hyperaldosteronism and the hypokalemia can be cured with adrenalectomy in practically all of these patients. Moreover, in a substantial proportion of them, the blood pressure can be normalized or markedly lowered if a unilateral cause of PA is discovered. Hence, the screening for PA can be rewarding both for the patient and for the clinician, particularly in those cases where hypertension is severe and/or resistant to treatment, in which the removal of an APA can allow blood pressure to be brought under control despite withdrawal of, or a prominent reduction in, the number and doses of antihypertensive medications.

### Left adrenal aldosteronism coexisting with left paraaortic paraganglioma presenting as bilateral adrenal and left paraaortic tumors-comprehensive adrenal evaluation aiding perfect management: a case report [^115qeSVW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coexistence of a catecholamine-secreting tumor and an adrenal cortical tumor is quite rare which makes both diagnosis and management challenging. The purpose of this article is to describe the presence of this condition, share a stepwise approach for preoperative evaluation, and review the related literature.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old male patient had a history of hypertension and aggravating hypokalemia for years. Abdominal computed tomography incidentally found concomitant bilateral adrenal and left para-aortic tumors. Comprehensive adrenal hormone tests revealed a high aldosterone renin ratio and mildly elevated 24-h urine vanillylmandelic acid and norepinephrine levels. Subsequently, a metaiodobenzylguanidine scan showed uptake over the left para-aortic tumor, and NP-59 adrenal scintigraphy showed uptake over the left adrenal tumor. Further confirmatory tests, including captopril suppression, irbesartan suppression, and saline infusion, all confirmed the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism. Adrenal venous sampling following 2 months of preparation with an alpha blocker demonstrated a left aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma. Combining hormonal analysis, imaging studies, and adrenal venous sampling, the patient was diagnosed with left adrenal aldosteronoma, right adrenal nonfunctional tumor, and left para-aortic paraganglioma (PGL). Accordingly, laparoscopic left adrenalectomy and left PGL excision were performed smoothly under alpha blocker maintenance. The pathology report confirmed left adrenal cortical adenoma and left para-aortic PGL. Postoperatively, the blood pressure, biochemical tests, and adrenal hormone assays returned to normal, and related symptoms disappeared and were relatively stable during the follow-up period of two years.

Conclusions

This is the first case of left para-aortic PGL coexisting with an ipsilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma presenting as a left para-aortic tumor associated with bilateral adrenal tumors. Awareness of the rarity of this coexistence can avoid unexpected disasters during the process of evaluation and management.

Primary aldosteronism — screening recommendations (class and level): COR 1, LOE C-EO — In adults with hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism is recommended in the presence of any of the following conditions to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy: resistant hypertension (regardless of whether hypokalemia is present), hypokalemia (spontaneous or diuretic induced), OSA, incidentally discovered adrenal mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at a young age (< 40 years). COR 2b, LOE C-EO — In adults with stage 2 hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism may be considered to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy.

### Clinical outcomes of primary aldosteronism based on lateralization index and contralateral suppression index after adrenal venous sampling in real-world practice: a retrospective cohort study [^117MZuki]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension (HTN) affecting about 5 to 10% of hypertensive population. PA is caused by inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of aldosterone leading to high plasma sodium retention, suppression of plasma renin, and increased potassium excretion. These conditions lead to arterial HTN and hypokalemia. Prolonged PA increases the risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the early detection and appropriate treatment of PA is important for preventing progressive organ damage and cardiovascular complication. PA is commonly caused by a unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (APA), bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (BAH) or rarely adrenal carcinoma. The classification of PA subtype is very crucial because unilateral APA is considered to be curable. The clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society recommend adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan as the initial diagnostic imaging for classification of subtype after PA is screened with plasma aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR). Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) should be performed when surgery is decided to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral adrenal diseases. This procedure is invasive and difficult to perform; The success rate of both adrenal veins catheterization was presented in a various range (42–98%). Clinicians are often faced with conflicting results when conducting AVS and adrenal CT scan to differentiate between APA and BAH.

Recently, several studies used suppression of serum aldosterone levels in uninvolved contralateral adrenal as an optional criterion to confirm APA. However, these data were investigated only in patients who underwent adrenalectomy immediately after AVS. The most crucial aim in the real world practice is to determine the appropriate treatment through early accurate diagnosis and to improve the patients' outcome.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the result of the AVS performed in our institution and to evaluate the treatment outcomes based on these results. Moreover, we aimed to determine whether the contralateral suppression index could be used as a diagnostic criterion when catheterization fails or when a discrepancy in the AVS results and imaging findings occurs in the real-world practice.

MEN1 adrenal lesions — biochemical evaluation is specified as follows: a serum cortisol level measured postdexamethasone ≤ 50 nmol/L (≤ 1.8 μg/dL) serves as a threshold for excluding autonomous cortisol secretion. It is recommended to measure plasma-free metanephrines or urinary-fractionated metanephrines for all patients with adrenal lesions that do not exhibit characteristics suggestive of benign adenomas. In patients presenting with concomitant hypertension or unexplained hypokalemia, determining the aldosterone/renin ratio is advisable to evaluate for primary aldosteronism.
