## Question

Is codeine constipating

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether codeine is constipating. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism by which codeine affects the gut. Then, I should verify what regulatory labeling says about constipation as an adverse effect. Next, I will review clinical prevalence data and comparative risk across opioids. After that, I should examine mechanistic and translational studies that quantify transit effects. Finally, I will consider dose dependence, special populations, and practical management implications to synthesize a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get that wrong, everything downstream could be off. Codeine is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that acts peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing motility, increasing smooth muscle tone, and decreasing propulsive peristalsis, which collectively leads to harder stools and slower transit; importantly, patients rarely develop tolerance to this constipating effect, so it tends to persist with ongoing therapy [^3e9d0f99] [^4b0a5295] [^a8eecd4d].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling, since that carries high evidentiary weight for adverse effects. Multiple FDA labels consistently list constipation as a very common adverse reaction with codeine, often alongside nausea and vomiting, and explicitly advise clinicians to counsel patients about the potential for severe constipation and to provide management instructions; this pattern repeats across codeine sulfate, acetaminophen–codeine, and promethazine–codeine products, reinforcing that constipation is an expected, clinically significant risk with therapeutic use [^c0860594] [^0436bab2] [^28d04e9e] [^8b210617] [^9bcac40d].

> I should confirm prevalence and comparative risk next, not just assume class effects are uniform. Opioid-induced constipation affects roughly 40–80% of patients on opioids, and comparative cohort data show codeine carries a substantial absolute risk of severe constipation events, with crude rates around 8.6 per 1000 person-days in hospitalized cohorts; relative to codeine, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and combination opioids have higher risks, whereas tramadol has a lower risk, which helps contextualize codeine's risk profile without minimizing it [^4b0a5295] [^422315d3] [^e4547afc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without mechanistic translational data. In healthy volunteers, codeine significantly delays gastric emptying, small-bowel transit, and colonic transit, and these effects are reversible with peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists like alvimopan, which directly implicates peripheral mu-receptor activation as causal; naloxegol did not reverse acute codeine-induced transit delays in opioid-naïve subjects, but that study tested a fixed dose and may not reflect all clinical scenarios, so the core message remains that codeine predictably slows gut transit [^e68ac8e1] [^4467c356].

> I need to check dose dependence and special contexts, because risk is not binary. Higher daily opioid doses, particularly at or above 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day, are associated with increased constipation risk across opioids, and scheduled around-the-clock opioid regimens increase constipation risk compared with as-needed dosing; clinically, this means even "weak" opioids like codeine can cause significant constipation at therapeutic doses, especially with continuous use or when combined with other constipating agents such as anticholinergics [^e4547afc] [^d7051797] [^149ca36b].

> But wait, what if the patient already has baseline constipation or is in a setting where constipation is particularly harmful. Guidelines emphasize that constipation should be anticipated with codeine and that proactive management is warranted; in postpartum anal sphincter repair, for example, codeine-based constipating regimens worsened pain and delayed bowel movements compared with laxative strategies, illustrating that codeine's constipating effect can translate into clinically meaningful harm in sensitive populations [^5889e442] [^e1cb9ffb].

> Next, I should review practical management, because confirming the risk is only half the battle. First-line management of opioid-induced constipation includes scheduled osmotic and/or stimulant laxatives, attention to fluids and activity as tolerated, and escalation to peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists if laxatives fail; this approach is consistently recommended by the AGA and aligns with the mechanistic rationale of countering peripheral mu-receptor effects without compromising central analgesia [^0a6e15ca] [^588465e7] [^1c1b1ec2].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my conclusion matches the totality of evidence. Yes, codeine is unequivocally constipating via peripheral mu-opioid receptor activation that reduces motility and increases tone, with constipation reported as very common in FDA labeling, supported by high prevalence estimates for opioid-induced constipation, corroborated by controlled transit studies, and reflected in comparative risk data; the effect is dose related, persistent without tolerance, and clinically consequential enough that guidelines advise anticipatory counseling and proactive bowel regimens when codeine is used [^c0860594] [^4b0a5295] [^e68ac8e1] [^422315d3] [^0a6e15ca].

---

Codeine is **constipating** because it activates mu-opioid receptors in the gut, reducing motility and increasing sphincter tone, which leads to hard stools and infrequent bowel movements [^3e9d0f99] [^4b0a5295]. Constipation is a **very common side effect** of codeine, occurring in more than 10% of users, and is dose-dependent and often persistent without tolerance [^c0860594] [^a8eecd4d]. Clinicians should anticipate constipation with codeine and initiate preventive measures, such as hydration, diet, and laxatives; if constipation persists, consider switching to a less constipating opioid or adding a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (e.g. naloxegol, methylnaltrexone) [^0a6e15ca] [^1c1b1ec2].

---

## Mechanism of codeine-induced constipation

Codeine causes constipation primarily through **peripheral mu-opioid receptor activation** in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [^3e9d0f99]:

- **Reduced GI motility**: Codeine decreases propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon, slowing transit [^3e9d0f99].

- **Increased sphincter tone**: It increases anal sphincter tone, making defecation more difficult [^d37948a1].

- **Fluid reabsorption**: Codeine increases intestinal fluid absorption, resulting in harder, drier stools [^a8eecd4d].

These effects are **similar to other opioids** but are generally milder than with stronger agents like morphine or oxycodone [^e22e5c51].

---

## Prevalence and severity of constipation with codeine

Constipation is a **very common adverse effect** of codeine, with a reported incidence exceeding 10% in clinical studies and labeling [^c0860594]. The risk is **dose-dependent**, increasing with higher doses or prolonged use, and patients rarely develop tolerance to this effect [^a8eecd4d]. Severity ranges from mild discomfort to severe constipation requiring medical intervention, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, postpartum patients, or those with pre-existing GI conditions [^e1cb9ffb].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting constipation risk

Multiple clinical studies and guidelines consistently document codeine-associated constipation:

- **Healthy volunteer studies**: Codeine significantly delays gastric emptying, small bowel, and colonic transit, confirming its constipating effect [^e68ac8e1].

- **Comparative studies**: Codeine causes less severe constipation than stronger opioids (e.g. morphine, oxycodone) but more than tramadol, which has a different mechanism of action [^422315d3].

- **Clinical guidelines**: The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recognizes opioid-induced constipation (OIC) as a common and clinically significant issue, recommending proactive management strategies for patients on opioids, including codeine [^0a6e15ca].

---

## Factors influencing constipation risk with codeine

Several factors influence the **likelihood and severity** of constipation with codeine:

| **Factor** | **Influence on constipation risk** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses significantly increase risk [^e4547afc] |
| Duration of use | Prolonged use increases risk due to cumulative effects [^notfound] |
| Age | Elderly patients are at higher risk due to reduced GI motility |
| Comorbidities | Pre-existing GI conditions (e.g. IBS, diverticulosis) increase risk |
| Concomitant medications | Anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and iron supplements exacerbate constipation [^149ca36b] |

---

## Management strategies for codeine-induced constipation

Given the high incidence of constipation with codeine, **preventive and therapeutic strategies** are essential:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Increase dietary fiber, fluid intake, and physical activity to promote regular bowel movements [^8f34a8eb].

- **Laxatives**: Osmotic laxatives (e.g. polyethylene glycol) and stimulant laxatives (e.g. bisacodyl) are first-line treatments for opioid-induced constipation [^588465e7].

- **Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs)**: Agents such as naloxegol, methylnaltrexone, and naldemedine are recommended for laxative-refractory cases, as they specifically target opioid receptors in the gut without affecting analgesia [^1c1b1ec2] [^afedf614].

- **Opioid rotation**: Switching to a less constipating opioid (e.g. tramadol) may be considered in patients with severe or persistent constipation [^8f34a8eb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the need for **proactive management** of constipation in patients prescribed codeine:

- **First-line therapy**: Laxatives (osmotic or stimulant) are recommended as initial management for opioid-induced constipation [^0a6e15ca].

- **Second-line therapy**: PAMORAs are recommended for patients who do not respond adequately to laxatives [^1c1b1ec2].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be counseled on the high likelihood of constipation and provided with clear instructions on prevention and management strategies [^28d04e9e].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Codeine is **constipating** due to its activation of peripheral mu-opioid receptors, which reduce GI motility, increase sphincter tone, and promote fluid reabsorption. Constipation is a very common, dose-dependent, and often persistent side effect that requires anticipatory guidance and proactive management. Clinicians should routinely counsel patients, initiate preventive measures, and escalate to PAMORAs if constipation persists, balancing analgesic efficacy with GI tolerability.

### Effects of naloxegol on whole gut transit in opioid-naïve healthy subjects receiving codeine: a randomized, controlled trial [^4467c356]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea, vomiting, and constipation (OIC) are common adverse effects of acute or chronic opioid use. Naloxegol (25 mg) is an approved peripherally active mu-opiate opioid receptor antagonist.

Aim

To compare the effects on pan-gut transit of treatment with codeine, naloxegol, or combination in healthy volunteers.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, parallel-group study in 72 healthy opioid-naïve adults, randomized to: codeine (30 mg q.i.d.), naloxegol (25 mg daily), codeine and naloxegol, or matching placebo. During 3 days of treatment, we measured gastric emptying (GE) T 1/2, colonic filling at 6 hours (CF6), colonic geometric center at 24 and 48 hours, and ascending colon emptying (ACE) T 1/2.

Key Results

Participants were 59.7% women, median BMI 25.0 kg/m 2, and median age 33.8 years. Codeine significantly retarded GE T 1/2, CF6, overall colonic transit, and ACE T 1/2. There was significant difference (P = 0.026) in GE T 1/2 between codeine (144.0 min [IQR 110.5–238.6]) and naloxegol (95.5 min [89.1–135.4]). There was a significant overall group difference in CF6 (P = 0.023), with significant difference (P = 0.019) between codeine (11.0% [0.0–45.0]) and naloxegol (51% [18.8–76.2]). However, no significant differences were found between codeine-treated participants concomitantly receiving placebo or naloxegol.

Conclusions and Inferences

Short-term administration of naloxegol (25 mg) in healthy, opioid-naïve volunteers does not reverse the retardation of gastric, small bowel, or colonic transit induced by acute administration of codeine. Further studies with naloxegol at higher dose are warranted to assess the ability to reverse the retardation of transit caused by acute administration of codeine in opioid-naïve subjects.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (prometh with codeine) [^a2056dd7]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Codeine: Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically, but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder, with less sedation, respiratory depression and gastrointestinal, urinary, and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure, but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than morphine.

Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine.

Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system.

Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine.

Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus, and sweating.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate [^ba8e2836]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.

 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System

Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

### Laxatives Do not improve symptoms of opioid-induced constipation: results of a patient survey [^a8eecd4d]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioids have been important in pain management for a number of years. According to the World Health Organization's three-step analgesic ladder, weak opioids (e.g. codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol) should be used for moderate pain (at Step 2) and strong opioids (e.g. oxycodone, morphine) for severe pain (at Step 3). Despite being originally developed for cancer pain, this stepwise approach has been extended for use in chronic noncancer pain.

Opioids are known to cause a number of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that are collectively termed opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD). OIBD is characterized by hard, dry stools, straining, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal distension, and increased gastric reflux. The most common symptom of OIBD is opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Opioids cause constipation by binding to µ-opioid receptors in the GI tract, which reduces GI secretions and peristaltic activity and increases fluid reabsorption. The result is hard, dry stools that pass slowly through the gut. OIC is dose-dependent, and, unlike other GI symptoms, patients rarely develop tolerance to the constipating effects of opioids, so OIC does not resolve over time.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Antimotility agents for fecal incontinence: For fecal incontinence associated with diarrhea or loose stools, constipating medications, such as loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, and codeine phosphate, may be helpful. A randomized controlled trial of 80 patients comparing loperamide with psyllium found both decreased fecal incontinence episodes, but constipation was more frequent with loperamide (29.2% versus 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.05). In another prospective controlled study of 69 women initiating methylnaltrexone with loperamide and codeine if fecal incontinence persisted, the treatment group had a significantly higher cure rate (46% versus 0%; P < .01). In addition, a randomized crossover trial of 63 patients comparing loperamide with a low-residue diet versus loperamide with a high-fiber diet found similar improvement with a nonsignificant difference between treatment arms. Dosages can start with as little as one half a tablet of loperamide by mouth daily and can be titrated up to 4 mg two to three times daily as needed, with the maximum daily dose 16 mg per day.

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^046e8fac]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous work assessing the comparative risk of constipation between different opioids has been conflicting. This is in part due to the diagnosis of opioid-induced constipation in the literature being complicated by the lack of a consensus definition and underreporting when reliant on diagnostic codes within EHRs. A previous study comparing the risk of codeine vs. tramadol using primary care EHRs from Catalonia in Spain reported no significant differences in risk of constipation between drugs. However, the outcome definition of constipation in this study was based on ICD-10 codes, which is likely to be an under representation of those who have this specific outcome due to the reasons discussed above. For instance, the incidence rate of any constipation event in this study for codeine using ICD-10 codes was 6.41 per 1000 person-years; in our study, the rate for severe constipation on codeine was 8.61 per 1000 person-days which is considerably higher and more clinically plausible in keeping with patient self-reports, suggesting underreporting of this outcome using health codes alone. Another study using administrative health records in 14,491 patients with osteoarthritis found rates of specific opioid-associated outcomes that included constipation, nausea and others were lower in patients initiated on tramadol compared to those initiated on all other opioids, which is more consistent with our work. Neither study however was able to account for the effect of daily dose on the outcome.

Higher MME/day can be associated with a range of adverse events, with recommended MME/day thresholds advising caution and careful monitoring varying between 50 and 120 MME/day internationally. Our study demonstrated that the risk of severe constipation associated with opioids increased significantly in patients on ≥ 50 MME/day underscoring the importance of opioid stewardship, based on the individual patient. Patients on higher opioid doses may require vigilant monitoring and proactive management for constipation to mitigate these symptoms and prevent potential complications. Several studies reporting on opioid-associated adverse events do not report on the effect of MME/day, as it either be especially challenging to prepare such data with a combination of 'as required' and regular medications that may overlap or due to considerable missing information within the prescribing/dispensing data. Indeed, a recent Cochrane review evaluating the efficacy and safety of high-dose opioids in chronic non-cancer pain concluded that whilst such patients are commonly on high-dose opioids, studies rarely reported on dose. Therefore, it was unable to draw definitive conclusions based on high-quality scientific evidence.

Mechanism of Action

Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.

Pharmacodynamics

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^422315d3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparative risk of constipation associated with different opioids

The results for the association between the comparative risk of constipation with various opioids are presented in Table 2. In the 'opioid exposed vs. not-exposed' analysis, the crude rates of constipation in exposed and non-exposed person time were 12.0 events/1000 person-days and 6.44 events/1000 person-days, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62 to 1.90) in the opioid-exposed group compared to unexposed.

Table 2
Association between administered opioid exposure and severe constipation

Other opioids (diamorphine, dihydrocodeine, methanol, hydromorphone, pethidine) are excluded from this table due to low count

In the adjusted opioid drug class analysis, the most commonly administered drug, codeine, had a crude incidence rate of 8.61 events/1000 person-days, morphine 14.1 events/1000 person-days, oxycodone 13.1 events/1000 person-days, fentanyl 11.7 events/1000 person-days, combination opioid therapy 17.6 events/1000 person-days and tramadol 7.2/1000 person-days. Patients administered fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone and combination opioids had a significantly higher risk of experiencing constipation compared to those on codeine. Adjusted hazard ratios for specific drugs included fentanyl (HR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.64), morphine (HR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.74), oxycodone (HR 1.46, 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.63) and combination opioid therapy (HR 1.85, 95% CI, 1.66 to 2.06). There was a significantly lower risk of constipation associated with tramadol compared to codeine (HR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.00) (Table 2). In the sensitivity analysis restricting to only patients undergoing major and orthopaedic surgery, the results and direction of risk remain unchanged with wider confidence intervals due to fewer events (Additional file 1: Table S4). In these patients, there continued to be a significantly lower risk of constipation with tramadol compared to codeine (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23–0.95).

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^e4547afc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Constipation is a frequent adverse event associated with opioid medications that can have a considerable impact on patients' quality of life. In patients who require opioids for pain relief, less is known about the risk conferred by specific opioids given their diverse pharmacology and the effect of daily dose and potency. The aim of the study was to evaluate the comparative risk of severe constipation by opioid type and dose in patients with non-cancer pain admitted to hospital.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using hospital electronic health records in Northwest England between December 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020. Patients who were ≥ 18 years and without a history of cancer were included. Opioid exposure was measured using administered drug information in hospital. The outcome was a severe constipation event defined as administration of an enema or suppository. Incidence rates by opioid use status, type of opioid class and morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per day were calculated, and a Cox regression model was used to determine associations with incident constipation after adjusting for confounders.

Results

The study included 80,475 eligible patients who were administered an opioid in hospital. Compared to codeine, morphine (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.45–1.74), oxycodone (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.32–1.63), fentanyl (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14–1.64) and combination opioids (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.66–2.06) were associated with a higher risk of constipation in the fully adjusted models. Tramadol demonstrated a significantly lower risk compared to codeine (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–1.00). Higher opioid doses of more than ≥ 50 MME/day in comparison to < 50 MME/day were associated with an increased risk of constipation (compared to < 50 MME/day, 50 to < 120 MME/day: HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.78–2.15; ≥ 120 MME/day: HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.32–1.60).

Conclusions

Morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl and combination opioids administration were associated with a significantly higher risk of severe constipation compared to codeine. Tramadol was associated with the lowest risk of the outcome compared to codeine. Patients on ≥ 50 MME/day experienced a higher risk of severe constipation compared to those on < 50 MME/day. These results can be used to guide better shared decisions with patients to balance benefit and harms of specific opioid types and doses.

Codeine:

Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically, but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder, with less sedation, respiratory depression and gastrointestinal, urinary and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure, but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than morphine.

Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine.

Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system. Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine.

Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus and sweating.

Codeine and its salts are well absorbed following both oral and parenteral administration. Codeine is about ⅔ as effective orally as parenterally. Codeine is metabolized primarily in the liver by enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes O-demethylation, N-demethylation and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid. The drug is excreted primarily in the urine, largely as inactive metabolites and small amounts of free and conjugated morphine. Negligible amounts of codeine and its metabolites are found in the feces.

Following oral or subcutaneous administration of codeine, the onset of analgesia occurs within 15 to 30 minutes and lasts for four to six hours.

The cough-depressing action, in animal studies, was observed to occur 15 minutes after oral administration of codeine, peak action at 45 to 60 minutes after ingestion. The duration of action, which is dose-dependent, usually did not exceed 3 hours.

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^24daf385]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Constipation is a frequent adverse event associated with opioid medications that can have a considerable impact on patients' quality of life. In patients who require opioids for pain relief, less is known about the risk conferred by specific opioids given their diverse pharmacology and the effect of daily dose and potency. The aim of the study was to evaluate the comparative risk of severe constipation by opioid type and dose in patients with non-cancer pain admitted to hospital.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using hospital electronic health records in Northwest England between December 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020. Patients who were ≥ 18 years and without a history of cancer were included. Opioid exposure was measured using administered drug information in hospital. The outcome was a severe constipation event defined as administration of an enema or suppository. Incidence rates by opioid use status, type of opioid class and morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per day were calculated, and a Cox regression model was used to determine associations with incident constipation after adjusting for confounders.

Results

The study included 80,475 eligible patients who were administered an opioid in hospital. Compared to codeine, morphine (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.45–1.74), oxycodone (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.32–1.63), fentanyl (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14–1.64) and combination opioids (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.66–2.06) were associated with a higher risk of constipation in the fully adjusted models. Tramadol demonstrated a significantly lower risk compared to codeine (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–1.00). Higher opioid doses of more than ≥ 50 MME/day in comparison to < 50 MME/day were associated with an increased risk of constipation (compared to < 50 MME/day, 50 to < 120 MME/day: HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.78–2.15; ≥ 120 MME/day: HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.32–1.60).

Conclusions

Morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl and combination opioids administration were associated with a significantly higher risk of severe constipation compared to codeine. Tramadol was associated with the lowest risk of the outcome compared to codeine. Patients on ≥ 50 MME/day experienced a higher risk of severe constipation compared to those on < 50 MME/day. These results can be used to guide better shared decisions with patients to balance benefit and harms of specific opioid types and doses.

Pharmacology of opioid receptors

Opioid receptors located either within the central nervous system or peripherally are G protein coupled receptors which regulate pain and stress, and affect the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Three major classes of opioid receptors have been identified, µ, δ, and κ, and their preferred endogenous ligands are β-endorphin, enkephalin, and dynorphin, respectively. While µ receptors are the main mediators of the analgesia and side effects of opioids, the δ and κ receptors also mediate analgesia.

In the GI system, the µ receptors are expressed chiefly in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, and the δ receptors are present mainly in the myenteric plexus. These receptors have been identified in rodent and human GI tract, although their distributions in the GI tract differ among different species. These receptors activate potassium channels causing membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of calcium channels leading to decreased neurotransmitter release. These result in decreased gastric emptying, impaired internal anal sphincter relaxation in response to rectal distention, increased amplitude of nonpropulsive segmental contractions, and decreased gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal fluid secretions with increased fluid absorption in the intestines as shown predominantly in preclinical studies. However, codeine and morphine have been shown to slow gastric, and colonic transit – in healthy human volunteers.

Discussion

In this retrospective cohort study, the administration of specific opioid drugs and regimens were associated with a differential risk of severe constipation. Patients who were administered morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl or a combination of opioids had a higher risk of constipation compared to patients administered codeine after adjusting for confounding factors. Tramadol administration was associated with a lower risk of severe constipation compared to codeine. Additionally, patients administering opioids of more than 50 MME per day were at higher risk of developing severe constipation than those who did not.

Opioids, as a class of medications, are well known to be associated with constipation and other less common gastrointestinal effects, as they bind not only to mu-opioid receptors present in the brain and spinal cord but also in the gut. This results in reduced peristalsis (gastric motility) and increases fluid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to hard stools that are difficult to pass. However, the extent to which they activate these receptors in the gastrointestinal tract can vary depending on the pharmacological action of the specific drug. The differences in pharmacological profiles between opioids can, therefore, lead to differential risks, as reported in our study. Tramadol has a different mechanism of action to other opioids as, alongside its opioid receptor activity, it is also a partial inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. This may explain why it was associated with a significantly lower risk of severe constipation compared to codeine in this study. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor, which may be associated with the lower incidence rate of events compared to codeine and the statistically non-significant lower adjusted HR. Often considered a less potent opioid, codeine was not associated with the lowest risk of this outcome.

### Codeine sulfate [^3e9d0f99]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Codeine sulfate is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

E ff e cts on the Central Nervous System:

Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

E ff e cts on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle:

Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

E ff e cts on the Cardiovascular System:

Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen

Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their healthcare provider if they have taken more than the recommended dose.

Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery

Inform patients that acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery and to avoid such tasks while taking this product, until they know how they will react to the medication.

Constipation

Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Adrenal Insufficiency

Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms (see WARNINGS).

Hypotension

Inform patients that acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) (see WARNINGS; Hypotension).

Anaphylaxis

Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction, and if they develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing to stop taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and seek medical attention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^4126a6d1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study, to our knowledge, is the largest study evaluating the comparative safety of constipation across different opioids in patients with non-cancer pain. We used hospital EHRs to define exposure using administrations of different opioids to reduce exposure misclassification and the administration of suppositories to measure the outcome of severe constipation accurately at the time of the event. Compared to codeine, administration of tramadol conferred a lower risk of severe constipation whilst morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl and combination of opioids were associated with a higher risk. Additionally, a daily MME of ≥ 50 per day was also associated with a higher risk of severe constipation compared to those on daily doses of < 50 MME/day. The results can help more tailored prescribing based on individual patient needs and allow more informed shared decisions that can prompt discussions about opioid tapering where appropriate.

7.7 Muscle Relaxants

Codeine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Avoid the use of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution in patients taking muscle relaxants. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.

7.8 Diuretics

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.

7.9 Anticholinergic Drugs

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

'Weak' opioid analgesics (WHO level 2)

'Weak' opioid analgesics should be used in patients with moderate pain (standard, expert agreement).

Weak opioid analgesics can be used alone or in combination with a level 1 analgesic (option, expert agreement). The following products can be used: codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, tramadol (option, expert agreement). There are no absolute criteria to guide the selection of the different drugs.

Tramadol should not be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (standard, expert agreement). Tramadol should be used with caution in patients with a risk of epilepsy and when used in combination with antidepressants (recommendation, expert agreement).

Dextropropoxyphene should not be used in combination with carbamazepine as it will induce an increase in the plasma concentration of carbamazepine (recommendation, expert agreement).

Constipation should always be anticipated in patients receiving codeine (standard, expert agreement).

Strong opioid analgesics (WHO level 3)

Strong opioid analgesics should be used in patients with moderate to severe pain (standard, expert agreement).

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^8f34a8eb]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — initial assessment and conservative measures emphasize that one of the first steps is to ensure the opioid indication is appropriate, participation in a pain management program, and use of the minimum necessary opioid dose; a suggested general approach includes careful history of bowel patterns, stool consistency, dysynergic symptoms, and alarm features, with other causes considered and excluded. Lifestyle modifications are an appropriate first step, including increasing fluid intake, moderate exercise as tolerated, and toileting promptly when urged. There may also be benefit in "opioid switching" to an equianalgesic dose of a less-constipating opioid; oral or parenteral morphine may induce more constipation than transdermal opioids, such as fentanyl. Combination opioid agonist/antagonist agents (eg, oxycodone + naloxone) are also associated with lower risk of constipation. Once OIC is confirmed and other causes excluded, the recommendations can guide appropriate evidence-based management.

12.4 Mechanism of Action

Codeine

Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic and antitussive properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine. The precise mechanism of action of codeine and other opiates is not known; however, codeine is believed to act centrally on the cough center. In excessive doses, codeine will depress respiration.

Promethazine

Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative, which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side chain and no ring substitution. Promethazine possesses antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist), antiemetic, sedative, and anticholinergic effects. It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa.

### Using visual prompts to aid analgesia prescribing [^8d84dd42]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The "pain ladder" or "analgesic ladder" was devised by the World Health Organisation to describe the steps to take when prescribing analgesia. It was originally applied to the management of cancer pain and is now widely used by medical professionals for all types of pain. It describes three steps when managing pain:

Prompt administration of a non-opioid eg paracetamol
If pain persists, administer an additional weak opioid eg codeine
Then administer strong opioids eg morphine until the patient is pain free.

Opioid prescribing has well known common adverse effects for the patient including constipation and nausea. These side effects can be managed with appropriate concurrent prescribing of laxatives and antiemetics alongside opioids. Often these concurrent medications are not prescribed until the patient is actively complaining of symptoms. At GWH it is seen as good practice to prescribe these medications early to limit patient discomfort and distress.

The aim of this project was to improve both the quality and safety of analgesia prescribing at GWH. Within such a vast area two points were chosen to focus on that could be measured. Firstly, with regards to quality, are laxatives being prescribed alongside opioids? And secondly, with regards to safety, are doctors accurate when converting opioids to its morphine equivalent?

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^4b0a5295]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline — opioid-induced constipation (OIC) epidemiology, mechanism, and definitions are summarized as follows: Approximately 9–12 million Americans suffer from chronic pain annually, and it is estimated that 4%–5% of the US population use prescription opioids regularly; constipation is near universal in patients taking opioid medications and OIC is estimated to affect 40%–80% of patients taking opioids. OIC occurs primarily via activation of enteric μ-receptors, and the term opioid-induced constipation refers simply to constipation that is a result of opioid therapy. The Rome IV definition for OIC describes new or worsening symptoms of constipation when initiating, changing, or increasing opioid therapy that includes 2 or more of the following: straining during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, lumpy or hard stools more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, sensation of incomplete evacuation more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, manual maneuvers to facilitate more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations, or fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week, and these definitions include not only a change in stool frequency, but also changes in stool consistency and/or difficulty with defecation. A consensus definition also states OIC is "a change when initiating opioid therapy from baseline bowel habits" with features including reduced bowel movement frequency, development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation, or harder stool frequency.

### Butalbital, acetaminophen, caffeine, and codeine phosphate (Fioricet with codeine) [^71ce2663]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Butalbital, a barbiturate, is a GABAAreceptor agonist and may inhibit excitatory AMPA receptors.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.

Caffeine is a methylxanthine and CNS stimulant. The exact mechanism with respect to the indication is not clear; however, the effects of caffeine may be due to antagonism of adenosine receptors.

Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Butalbital, a barbiturate, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that can produce sedation, respiratory depression, and euphoria. The potential impact of butalbital on painful stimuli is not clear and in some individuals barbiturates may increase reaction to painful stimuli.

Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.

Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Acetaminophen has been shown to have analgesic activity in animal and human studies.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

### Constipation: opioid antagonists in people prescribed opioids [^ee26f447]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is a common adverse effect of opioids. As an example, constipation is reported in 52% of people with advanced malignancy, and this figure rises to 87% in people who are terminally ill and taking opioids. There is no reason to believe that people with chronic non-malignant disease who are prescribed opioids will be any less troubled by this adverse effect.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of opioid antagonists for constipation in people prescribed opioids? The population we studied included people with any condition, although most studies were in people with cancer pain. We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 162 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 84 records were screened for inclusion in the review. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 47 studies and the further review of 37 full publications. Of the 37 full articles evaluated, two systematic reviews and one RCT were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for three interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness of alvimopan, methylnaltrexone, and naloxone.

### Association of tramadol vs codeine prescription dispensation with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes [^7ad66572]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Although tramadol is increasingly used to manage chronic noncancer pain, few safety studies have compared it with other opioids.

Objective

To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people). Patients 18 years or older with 1 or more year of available data and dispensation of tramadol or codeine (2007–2017) were included and followed up to December 31, 2017.

Exposures

New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation in the previous year).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation. Absolute rate differences (ARDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using cause-specific Cox models.

Results

Of the 1 093 064 patients with a tramadol or codeine dispensation during the study period (326 921 for tramadol, 762 492 for codeine, 3651 for both drugs concomitantly), a total of 368 960 patients (184 480 propensity score-matched pairs) were included after study exclusions and propensity score matching (mean age, 53.1 [SD, 16.1] years; 57.3% women). Compared with codeine, tramadol dispensation was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (incidence, 13.00 vs 5.61 per 1000 person-years; HR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.08–2.56]; ARD, 7.37 [95% CI, 6.09–8.78] per 1000 person-years), cardiovascular events (incidence, 10.03 vs 8.67 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05–1.27]; ARD, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.45–2.36] per 1000 person-years), and fractures (incidence, 12.26 vs 8.13 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37–1.65]; ARD, 4.10 [95% CI, 3.02–5.29] per 1000 person-years). No significant difference was observed for the risk of falls, delirium, constipation, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population-based cohort study, a new prescription dispensation of tramadol, compared with codeine, was significantly associated with a higher risk of subsequent all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and fractures, but there was no significant difference in the risk of constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders. The findings should be interpreted cautiously, given the potential for residual confounding.

### Blood-brain barrier: mechanisms governing permeability and interaction with peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists [^11d61033]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Peripheral opioid antagonism

One of the advantages of a highly impermeable BBB is that it can be exploited to limit the activity of a drug to the periphery. This strategy was used to develop PAMORAs, which are prescribed primarily for opioid-induced constipation (OIC). OIC frequently occurs with opioid use and is caused by activation of opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. Signaling from μ-opioid receptors in the mucosal epithelium results in inhibition of neurons of the myenteric plexus, a key regulator of gastrointestinal motility (figure 2). Although many patients develop tolerance to opioid analgesia and require increasing doses for pain relief, little tolerance to OIC develops over time.

Figure 2
Mechanism of peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists. Reprinted from The Lancet, 373, Becker G, Blum HE, Novel opioid antagonists for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and postoperative ileus, 1198–1206, Copyright 2009, with permission from Elsevier. CNS, central nervous system.

While laxatives are often the first treatment option for OIC, they frequently yield complications and poor outcomes.OIC can be also improved by use of opioid antagonists such as naloxone; however, naloxone crosses the BBB and decreases opioid analgesia.PAMORAs are able to reduce the symptoms of OIC while maintaining the efficacy of opioid agonists in the CNS. Three PAMORAs have been developed to treat OIC: methylnaltrexone (Relistor), naloxegol (Movantik), and naldemedine (Symproic). A fourth PAMORA, alvimopan (Entereg), is indicated to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following surgeries that include partial bowel resection with primary anastomosis. These PAMORAs exhibit distinct clinical profiles and employ different mechanisms that restrict their movement across the BBB. The chemical structures of each PAMORA, as well as the chemical structures for morphine, codeine and naloxone, for reference, are depicted in figure 3. Comparison of efficacy among the PAMORAs is difficult because clinical outcomes were not the same in all trials. However, there are several publications that have reviewed the efficacy and safety of this class.

Opioid-induced constipation management mechanisms — laxatives work via a variety of mechanisms to improve the frequency of bowel movements, the consistency of stool, or to facilitate defecation; classes described include stool softeners, osmotic laxatives, lubricants, and stimulant laxatives, and there is little evidence that routine use of stimulant laxatives is harmful to the colon; fiber has a limited role in OIC except possibly in persons with fiber-deficient diets, and enemas are occasionally used as rescue therapy but are not used as regularly as other agents due to convenience, patient preference, and safety concerns.

### Laxatives Do not improve symptoms of opioid-induced constipation: results of a patient survey [^10de0d98]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional survey carried out in the United Kingdom between May 2013 and October 2014. Patients were recruited via social media, pharmacies, and advertisements in newspapers and on patient websites. Patients with any pain condition (including back pain, arthritis, cancer, headache and nerve pain) who had been taking Step 2 or 3 oral opioid medication (e.g. codeine, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, morphine, or tramadol) for at least one month were eligible to take part. Back pain could include failed back surgery, osteoporosis, and nonspecific pain. At screening, any patients who had not been taking opioids for at least one month were excluded from completing the full survey and no further details were collected.

Patients completed the survey online or over the telephone. The survey included questions on patients' pain condition, opioid medication, laxative use, bowel movements, and contact with health care professionals.

Patients who said they were using laxatives were asked to select side effects they had experienced from a list of common symptoms. Those who reported at least one side effect were then asked how much laxatives interfered with their work and social activities on a five-point scale, where 1 = all of the time and 5 = none of the time. Patients were also asked about any other measures they had taken to try and ease their constipation. Bowel movements were assessed using the Bowel Function Index (BFI). Patients rated ease of defecation, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and personal judgement of constipation on a scale of 0–100, where a lower score indicated better bowel function. Their total BFI score was calculated as the mean of these three scores. Normal bowel function was defined as a BFI score of 28.8 or lower. The BFI is a validated tool that has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pain Medicine Foundation and the American Gastroenterological Association for assessment of OIC.

The study was submitted to the National Research Ethics Centre, who confirmed that it would not require formal approval.

Data were analyzed descriptively. For categorical variables, the number and percentage falling into each category were reported. For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range (IQR), and range were reported. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.2.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in non-ambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.

Other adverse reactions include allergic reactions, euphoria, dysphoria, constipation, abdominal pain, pruritus, rash, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.

### Emerging treatments in neurogastroenterology: a multidisciplinary working group consensus statement on opioid-induced constipation [^937e7b58]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Opioids are effective for acute and chronic pain conditions, but their use is associated with often difficult-to-manage constipation and other gastrointestinal (GI) effects due to effects on peripheral μ-opioid receptors in the gut. The mechanism of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) differs from that of functional constipation (FC), and OIC may not respond as well to most first-line treatments for FC. The impact of OIC on quality of life (QoL) induces some patients to decrease or stop their opioid therapy to relieve or avoid constipation.

Purpose

At a roundtable meeting on OIC, a working group developed a consensus definition for OIC diagnosis across disciplines and reviewed current OIC treatments and the potential of treatments in development. By consensus, OIC is defined as follows: 'A change when initiating opioid therapy from baseline bowel habits that is characterized by any of the following: reduced bowel movement frequency, development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation, or harder stool consistency'. The working group noted the prior validation of a patient response outcome and end point for clinical trials and recommended future efforts to create treatment guidelines and QoL measures specific for OIC. Details from the working group's discussion and consensus recommendations for patient care and research are presented in this article.

### Codeine and chlorpheniramine maleate er [^abb766bb]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

7.1 Benzodiazepines, Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)

The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE may cause an additive CNS depressant effect, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death and should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants

Do not prescribe CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE if the patient is taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with codeine preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or codeine.

7.3 Anticholinergic Drugs

Codeine and chlorpheniramine should be administered cautiously to persons receiving other anticholinergic drugs in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects.

Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with chlorpheniramine.

7.4 Inhibitors or Inducers of Metabolic Enzymes

Codeine is metabolized by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine's inactive metabolite norcodeine. Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine's active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide. The contribution of these active metabolites to the overall antitussive effect of codeine is not known, but should be considered.

Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered. The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. Patients should be monitored for evidence of phenytoin toxicity such as ataxia, hyperreflexia, nystagmus and tremor when these two drugs are co-administered.

### Insights on efficacious doses of PAMORAs for patients on chronic opioid therapy or opioid-naïve patients [^65db7f19]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a major side effect of opioid use. Centrally acting antagonists result in opioid withdrawal or worsening of pain and lead to use of peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). The required doses of the PAMORAs, methylnaltrexone and naloxegol, in the treatment of OIC are well established in chronic opioid users. OIC may occur after short duration of opioid treatment; the required doses of naloxone, naltrexone, and PAMORAs in opioid-naïve subjects (with no opioid use for at least 3 months) are unclear. The aim of this review was to evaluate the PAMORA dose required for opioid-naïve subjects to achieve similar beneficial effects on symptoms or valid surrogates to those observed in chronic opioid users.

Methods

A PubMed search of μ-opioid antagonists to counter μ-opioid effects included terms: naloxone, naltrexone, methylnaltrexone, alvimopan, and naloxegol, as well as OIC and colonic transit.

Key Results

The approved dose of methylnaltrexone in chronic opioid users, 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneous (SQ), did not affect motility in opioid-naïve subjects. Trials investigating the required dose of alvimopan showed 0.5–1 mg dose was efficacious in treating OIC; a 10-fold higher dose (12 mg) of alvimopan is needed to block effects of codeine on small bowel and colonic transit in opioid-naïve subjects compared to chronic opioid users. Opioid-naïve users need 125 mg of naloxegol to reverse the effects of opioids on transit; this is in contrast to the 12.5 to 25 mg needed to treat OIC in chronic opioid users.

Conclusions & Inferences

Opioid-naïve subjects require a higher dose of PAMORA than chronic opioid users to achieve μ-opioid antagonist effect.

Prucalopride for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — evidence and outcomes indicate limited support with low-quality data. The panel identified one 4-week phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 196 randomized to placebo or prucalopride 2 mg or 4 mg for 4 weeks and a 12-week trial terminated early. Across studies, 126 (58.3%) of 216 receiving prucalopride responded versus 62 (41.6%) of 149 on placebo; pooled RR was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.08–1.70). In a phase 2 study, mean change from baseline in SBM frequency was 2.2 (2 mg) and 2.5 (4 mg) versus 1.5 with placebo. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 8 (6.2%) of 130 on prucalopride compared to 7 (10.6%) of 66 on placebo. Based on the low-quality evidence, the AGA made no recommendation for prucalopride and identified this as an evidence gap.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^c6094825]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

Effects on the Endocrine System

Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.

Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^2ec093a7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The major strengths of this study include the use of administered drug data rather than prescribing data, which provided more accurate exposure information and reduced the risk of exposure misclassification, especially for an 'as required' medication. Additionally, we used a novel approach in defining the outcome of constipation based on administered suppository and enema use, which is less reliant on health codes or the patient's willingness to approach their health care professional. We also incorporated the effects of dose and potency, by evaluating the effect of MME/day on the outcome using clinically meaningful thresholds. Previous work evaluating the effect of opioid type on adverse events such as constipation has used crude proxy measures for assessing dose instead such as dispensed packages of opioids. The findings of this work need to be interpreted in the context of its limitations. We were not able to stratify if the patient had previously been exposed to an opioid pre-admission to hospital or had a previous history of constipation. Whilst our choice of outcome had specific advantages, it meant that only severe constipation episodes would be captured if a suppository or enema was administered. Mild to moderate constipation that may respond to a laxative was not assessed. Severe constipation was defined as per administered medication data from EHRs rather than fulfilling diagnostic criteria. Whilst there are diagnostic criteria for different types of constipation that exist such as the Rome-IV diagnostic criteria, they are based on information about the patient straining, sensations of anorectal blockage/incomplete evacuation and measurement of stools against the Bristol stool index. As study used routinely collected data from EHRs which not include all the data items needed to apply the Rome-IV criteria, it was not possible to apply such criteria. Including laxatives for defining the outcome was considered and rejected, however, as they are often prescribed and administered in patients on opioids as prophylaxis rather than treatment. Effect modification through concomitant use of specific medications that may influence the outcome, such as anticholinergics or time varying laxative use at the time of the opioid use, was not assessed. As the length of stay in hospital for most patients was fairly modest, the effect of long-term opioid use on the outcome (e.g. 3 months or over) was out of scope of this study. The specific opioids evaluated in this study reflect the opioids most frequently prescribed in the UK, which include codeine, tramadol and morphine. Whilst our previous work has shown that there are clear overlaps between the first-line opioid prescription preferences in the UK, Canada, the USA and Taiwan, the frequency of opioid type can vary across jurisdictions. Given there are known pharmacological differences between opioid types, these data cannot be extrapolated to drugs such as hydrocodone and hydromorphone which are not commonly prescribed in the UK but more frequently prescribed in North America. Patients undergoing specific types of surgery such as bowel resections may have a different baseline risk of constipation depending on whether this was a symptom before administration of opioids. However, the most common types of major/orthopaedic surgery from a previous study using the same data source describing post-operative use of opioids were spinal decompressions, neurosurgery, knee/hip replacement and cholecystectomy reflecting the surgical expertise in this centre. Finally, lifestyle factors such as mobility and diet are known to impact the risk of constipation and are not measured in EHRs; therefore, their impact could not be examined.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^2d494b76]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation — evidence gaps and priorities for future research include limited long-term data, short trial durations, and lack of comparative and economic evaluations. There are limited published data on long-term use of prescription OIC medications, with most trials studying 4- to 12-week treatment durations. There is a paucity of comparative effectiveness studies comparing drugs to each other, and cost-effectiveness studies are also lacking.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^e922dc0f]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To formulate timely evidence-based guidelines for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Setting

Constipation is a major untoward effect of opioids. Increasing prescription of opioids has correlated to increased incidence of opioid-induced constipation. However, the inhibitory effects of opioids are not confined to the colon, but also affect higher segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the coining of the term "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction".

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Predefined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to identify and categorize relevant papers. A series of statements were formulated and justified by a comment, then labeled with the degree of agreement and their level of evidence as judged by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) system.

Results

From a list of 10,832 potentially relevant studies, 33 citations were identified for review. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications. Current definitions, prevalence, and mechanism of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction were reviewed, and a treatment algorithm and statements regarding patient management were developed to provide guidance on clinical best practice in the management of patients with opioid-induced constipation and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Conclusions

In recent years, more insight has been gained in the pathophysiology of this "entity"; new treatment approaches have been developed, but guidelines on clinical best practice are still lacking. Current knowledge is insufficient regarding management of the opioid side effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, but recommendations can be derived from what we know at present.

### Randomized, clinical trial of bowel confinement vs. laxative use after primary repair of a third-degree obstetric anal sphincter tear [^e1cb9ffb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Third-degree tears are generally managed by primary anal sphincter repair. Postoperatively, some physicians recommend laxative use, whereas others favor bowel confinement after anorectal reconstructive surgery. This randomized trial was designed to compare a laxative regimen with a constipating regimen in early postoperative management after primary obstetric anal sphincter repair.

Methods

A total of 105 females were randomized after primary repair of a third-degree tear to receive lactulose (laxative group) or codeine phosphate (constipated group) for three days postoperatively. Patients were reviewed at three days and at three months postpartum. Recorded outcome measures were symptomatic and functional outcome and early postoperative morbidity.

Results

Forty-nine patients were randomly assigned to the constipated group and 56 patients to the laxative group. The first postoperative bowel motion occurred at a median of four (mean, 4.5 (range, 1–9)) days in the constipated group and at two (mean, 2.5 (range, 1–7)) days in the laxative group (P < 0.001). Patients in the constipated group had a significantly more painful first evacuation compared with the laxative group (P < 0.001). The mean duration of hospital stay was 3.7 (range, 2–6) days in the constipated group and 3.05 days in the laxative group (range, 2–5; P = 0.001). Nine patients in the constipated group complained of troublesome postoperative constipation compared with three in the laxative group (P = 0.033). Continence scores, anal manometry, and endoanal ultrasound findings were similar in the two groups at three months postpartum.

Conclusions

Patients in the laxative group had a significantly earlier and less painful bowel motion and earlier postnatal discharge. There was no difference in the symptomatic or functional outcome of repair between the two regimens.

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^df17f9ef]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Covariates

Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, BMI, ethnicity and index of multiple deprivation (IMD), were measured and recorded on the hospital admission date. IMD, a relative measure of deprivation based on UK census data, was calculated using the first four digits of postcodes and reported in deciles. Conditions expected to be linked with constipation or to opioid administration, including irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, hypothyroidism, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, Crohn's disease, diverticulosis and chronic kidney disease, were defined using ICD-10 codes at discharge from the hospital within a 2-year window prior to the first admission of interest.

Statistical analysis

The cohort's baseline characteristics at the first index date were described using summary tables. In the analysis, we considered only the first admission episode. Crude incidence rates of constipation were calculated by opioid use status, type of opioid class and MME/day. To investigate the relationship between different types of opioid exposure and constipation, three separate Cox regression models were constructed. We performed a time-varying exposure analysis. The first model, referred to as 'opioid exposed vs. not-exposed', compared the risk of constipation amongst person time when any opioid was administered compared to person time when they were not exposed to opioids. The second model, the 'opioid drug class model', assessed the comparative risk of constipation associated with different opioid classes, using codeine as the referent group. Finally, the 'opioid dose model' examined the association between time varying levels of daily morphine milligram equivalents and the incidence of constipation. For each type of exposure measure, we fitted unadjusted and adjusted models (see Covariates section for the adjustment list and directed acyclic graph, Additional file 1: Fig. S2).

In all analyses, we considered a complete case analysis. In addition, all models used a risk attribution modelling approach whereby a patient was considered at risk of constipation for 1 day after the last day of opioid exposure to allow for the potentially long-lasting effects of these drugs. We performed an additional stratified analysis of patient who underwent major or orthopaedic surgery, as it could be an effect modifier in this study. All data analyses were performed using R (version 4.1.3).

### Promethazine and phenylephrine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (promethazine VC with codeine oral solution) [^c4541ded]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System Depressants, Including Alcohol

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Advise patients to avoid concomitant use of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants and to not use alcohol while taking Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Constipation

Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

Cardiovascular and CNS Effects

Inform patients that the phenylephrine contained in Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system effects in some patients such as, insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, transient elevations in blood pressure, or arrhythmias.

Anaphylaxis

Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

MAOI Interaction

Inform patients not to take Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution while using or within 14 days of stopping any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.17), and Drug Interactions (7.6)].

### Acetaminophen and codeine [^149ca36b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

The concomitant use of opioids and MAOIs, such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity.

Advise patients taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets not to use MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses of other opioids (such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone or buprenorphine) to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.

Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics

The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.

Muscle Relaxants

Acetaminophen and codeine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

If concomitant use is warranted, because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose (see WARNINGS).

Diuretics

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.

If concomitant use is warranted, evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.

Anticholinergic Drugs

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

If concomitant use is warranted, evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Codeine may increase serum amylase levels.

Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

### Pharmacotherapy for fecal incontinence: a review [^4e680a56]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence is a common clinical problem that often is frustrating to the patient and treating physician. Nonsurgical management for fecal incontinence includes dietary manipulation, Kegel exercises, perianal skin care, and biofeedback therapy. Pharmacotherapies often are used to assist in management of fecal incontinence. A variety of pharmacotherapies have been utilized for the management of fecal incontinence; limited data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials are available. This is a review of the existing literature on clinical trials of several classes of drugs and other medical therapies that may be beneficial for patients with fecal incontinence. The information in this article was obtained by a MEDLINE search for all clinical trials of drug therapy for fecal incontinence. These treatments and the existing data on their use are summarized. Treatments reviewed include stool bulking agents, with an emphasis on the most promising effect obtained with calcium polycarbophil, constipating agents, including loperamide, codeine, amitriptyline, atropine, and diphenoxylate agents injected into the anal sphincter, drugs to enhance anal sphincter function, including topical phenylepherine and oral sodium valproate, and trials of fecal disimpaction. A new classification to easily remember the treatment categories for this condition, based on the "ABCs of treatment for fecal incontinence", has been introduced into the structure of this review.

### Opioid-induced constipation [^db0018d2]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is common in people treated with opioids and poses risks for physical sequelae, analgesic discontinuation, and decreased quality of life.

Methods

Targeted literature review of evidence- and consensus-based data on appropriate diagnosis, concise definition, and conventional and newer management strategies for OIC.

Results

OIC may develop early and need early treatment. To address gaps in consistent definitions and treatment recommendations, a consensus panel organized through the American Academy of Pain Medicine Foundation set diagnostic criteria and endorsed the Bowel Function Index for OIC assessment. The panel further proposed management strategies for OIC, including a proposed threshold for prescriptive therapies.

Discussion

OIC results from action exerted on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, a mechanism distinct from idiopathic constipation. Lifestyle changes and over-the-counter drugs are first-line treatments but leave refractory constipation in many opioid-treated patients. Newer therapeutic modalities that are available and in development are highlighted.

Summary

Physicians need a better understanding of the negative impacts of OIC for patients and better OIC-specific methods to assess, treat, and monitor it.

### Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults [^2b317845]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials.

Main Results

Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross-over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight-reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. Seven trials tested anti-diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc-aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses. Zinc-aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group. It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^c426778e]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patient‐Reported Outcome Measures

Compared with objective measures, PRO measures are more effective in capturing patient perceptions of constipation severity and patient experience 49. The PROs of straining and incomplete rectal evacuation, both included in the proposed consensus definition of OIC 3, are common and highly bothersome among patients with the condition 9, 46. Other key PROs include pain/discomfort, bloating, fatigue, and fear or distress 9, 44, 47. Many patients who experience these symptoms in the context of OIC would consider themselves constipated, regardless of stool frequency. However, there are no studies validating specific outcome measures. In addition, different scales are being used for the same outcome across trials (often inconsistently) 12. Thus, in order to identify a comprehensive and practical method for assessing bowel function and determining changes in OIC severity, an analysis of formally validated PRO assessment tools is required.

These signs include slow or shallow breathing, difficulty or noisy breathing, confusion, more than usual sleepiness, trouble breastfeeding, or limpness. If you notice any of these signs, stop giving the medicine and seek medical attention immediately by going to an emergency room or calling 911.
- Common side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling tired, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, itching, or rash.
- In 2014, nearly 1. 9 million patients 18 years of age and younger received a dispensed prescription for codeine-containing products from U. S. outpatient retail pharmacies. Of the total pediatric patients, nearly 1. 4 million patients received codeine-containing analgesic products, and 483, 000 patients received codeine-containing cough-and-cold products.

### Evidence for the use of opioid medication for pediatric acute pain in the outpatient setting: technical report [^d7051797]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric postoperative pain — PICOT 1 (opioid comparisons and scheduling) identifies 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in outpatient children and concludes that three opioid-versus-no-opioid studies support nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line postoperative therapy due to similar pain control and fewer side effects; a tramadol versus codeine/acetaminophen trial is no longer clinically relevant; and scheduled (around-the-clock) opioid dosing may provide more consistent pain relief but with greater constipation risk. Specifically, pain relief was "statistically superior in the around-the-clock group, although of unclear clinical significance", with "no differences in the incidence of side effects… with the exception of constipation", which occurred more frequently after surgery in the around-the-clock group and not in the as-needed group.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^491ce705]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Aims of this consensus panel were to determine (1) an optimal symptom‐based method for assessing opioid‐induced constipation in clinical practice and (2) a threshold of symptom severity to prompt consideration of prescription therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 10 experts with extensive knowledge/experience with opioid‐associated adverse events convened to discuss the literature on assessment methods used for opioid‐induced constipation and reach consensus on each objective using the nominal group technique.

Results

Five validated assessment tools were evaluated: the Patient Assessment of Constipation–Symptoms (PAC‐SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation–Quality of Life (PAC‐QOL), Stool Symptom Screener (SSS), Bowel Function Index (BFI), and Bowel Function Diary (BF‐Diary). The 3‐item BFI and 4‐item SSS, both clinician administered, are the shortest tools. In published trials, the BFI and 12‐item PAC‐SYM are most commonly used. The 11‐item BF‐Diary is highly relevant in opioid‐induced constipation and was developed and validated in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. However, the panel believes that the complex scoring for this tool and the SSS, PAC‐SYM, and 28‐item PAC‐QOL may be unfeasible for clinical practice. The BFI is psychometrically validated and responsive to changes in symptom severity; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity and scores > 28.8 points indicating constipation.

Conclusions

The BFI is a simple assessment tool with a validated threshold of clinically significant constipation. Prescription treatments for opioid‐induced constipation should be considered for patients who have a BFI score of ≥ 30 points and an inadequate response to first‐line interventions.

If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses of other opioids (such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, or buprenorphine) to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.

Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics

The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.

Muscle Relaxants

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. If concomitant use is warranted, because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose (see WARNINGS).

Diuretics

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. If concomitant use is warranted, evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.

Anticholinergic Drugs

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

If concomitant use is warranted, evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Codeine may increase serum amylase levels.

Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^4c143bb4]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Aims of this consensus panel were to determine (1) an optimal symptom-based method for assessing opioid-induced constipation in clinical practice and (2) a threshold of symptom severity to prompt consideration of prescription therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 10 experts with extensive knowledge/experience with opioid-associated adverse events convened to discuss the literature on assessment methods used for opioid-induced constipation and reach consensus on each objective using the nominal group technique.

Results

Five validated assessment tools were evaluated: the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), Stool Symptom Screener (SSS), Bowel Function Index (BFI), and Bowel Function Diary (BF-Diary). The 3-item BFI and 4-item SSS, both clinician administered, are the shortest tools. In published trials, the BFI and 12-item PAC-SYM are most commonly used. The 11-item BF-Diary is highly relevant in opioid-induced constipation and was developed and validated in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. However, the panel believes that the complex scoring for this tool and the SSS, PAC-SYM, and 28-item PAC-QOL may be unfeasible for clinical practice. The BFI is psychometrically validated and responsive to changes in symptom severity; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity and scores > 28.8 points indicating constipation.

Conclusions

The BFI is a simple assessment tool with a validated threshold of clinically significant constipation. Prescription treatments for opioid-induced constipation should be considered for patients who have a BFI score of ≥ 30 points and an inadequate response to first-line interventions.

### Laxatives Do not improve symptoms of opioid-induced constipation: results of a patient survey [^d78f7155]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Patient Characteristics

In total, 362 patients were screened and 198 were eligible to participate. Their median age was 50.2 years; 81% were over age 40 years. Most (85%) were female, and just over half (52%) reported they were unable to work owing to illness or disability (Table 1). Most (65%) were recruited via advertisements on the internet (Table 1).

Table 1
Patient demographics

Back pain, nerve pain, and arthritis were the most common indications for opioid use (Table 2). The most common types of back pain were sciatica, arthritis of the spine, and slipped disc. Codeine and codeine combinations were the most common currently prescribed opioids (Table 3). The mean (± SD) number of opioids prescribed was 1.5 (± 0.6), and 84 patients (42%) reported that they were currently prescribed two or more opioids; of these, 40 patients were taking a combination of weak and strong opioids. One hundred fifty-four patients (154/183, 84%) had been on their current opioid for at least six months; 82 of 188 patients (44%) reported that codeine and codeine combinations were their longest-prescribed opioid.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of opioid-induced constipation [^6e3be8a8]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Opioids are potent analgesics used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Side-effects are common and among the most bothersome are those associated with opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which includes opioid-induced constipation. In this Review, we provide a summary of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of opioid-induced constipation, which can be defined as a change in baseline bowel habit or defecatory patterns following initiation, alteration, or increase of opioid therapy. Opioid-induced constipation is a consequence of the action of opioids on their receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. A comprehensive clinical assessment is beneficial, including evaluation of the patient's understanding of their constipation and underlying condition for which opioids are used. Clinical assessment should also aim to differentiate opioid-induced constipation from pre-existing constipation exacerbated by the opioids. Preventive strategies need to be considered when patients start treatment with opioids, such as lifestyle changes. First-line management includes simple over-the-counter laxatives. The bowel function index can be useful to objectively identify patients who are refractory to these initial measures. In this context, alternative over-the-counter laxatives (or combinations of laxatives), secretogogues, or peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists might also be considered. Educational strategies need to be developed to improve the knowledge base of health-care providers on the identification and management of opioid-induced constipation.

### Comparative risk of severe constipation in patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain: a retrospective cohort study in northwest england [^55698fb7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure

Administered opioid data was assessed at an individual level, including drug name, route of administration, dosage, and day and time of administration, from inpatient e-prescribing data. All opioids were extracted reflecting the frequently prescribed opioids used in the UK. Drugs used for opioid use disorder such as methadone or those used for anaesthetic induction in hospitals such as remifentanil were excluded. The e-prescribing data were processed and converted to daily opioid use data following the steps provided in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. Two measures to assess opioid exposure were considered. The first categorical opioid exposure measure categorised on-drug periods into monotherapy opioid medications (codeine, tramadol, morphine, fentanyl, buprenorphine and oxycodone), an 'other' opioids category (including diamorphine, dihydrocodeine, methanol, hydromorphone and pethidine) and a 'combination opioid' category (e.g. oxycodone and morphine or codeine and oromorph administered concomitantly). We performed a time-varying exposure analysis, meaning if patients switched to another opioid their risk attribution would change accordingly. To allow direct comparison of doses and opioid potencies across all opioids and formulations, we calculated morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for each prescription. The second measure was MME/day as defined as the daily dose for each prescription multiplied by the equivalent analgesic ratio as specified by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The MME dose was categorised as off-drug, < 50 (reference category), 50 to < 120 and ≥ 120 MME/day. The threshold of < 50 MME/day was used as a cut-off as it is the threshold above which the US CDC recommends caution as patients may be exposed to progressive increase in harms with no additional benefit in pain or function. The Faculty of Pain Medicine in the UK currently suggests harms outweigh benefits when patients exceed 120 MME/day.

Outcome

A patient was considered to have a constipation event if they had been administered an enema or a suppository drug (Additional file 1: Table S2). ICD-10 codes at discharge were not used to define constipation as the date corresponded to the date of coding following discharge, not the event date, which is required in a time to event analysis. By using this outcome definition, severe constipation was measured through administration (rather than simply prescription) of these drugs and captured a more accurate and time-sensitive representation of constipation events during the hospital stay.

### Effect of alvimopan and codeine on gastrointestinal transit: a randomized controlled study [^e68ac8e1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

background & aims: Opiate bowel dysfunction is a significant clinical problem. Our aim was to evaluate the ability of a peripheral mu-opioid antagonist, alvimopan, to reverse the effect of codeine on gastric, small-bowel, and colonic transit time in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Seventy-four healthy participants (43 women) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner to 1 of 4 groups: alvimopan 12 mg twice daily in the presence and absence of codeine sulfate 30 mg 4 times/day, or codeine or placebo alone. Gastric emptying, small-bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy using a 99m-labeled technetium egg meal and 111-labeled indium charcoal delivered to the proximal colon via a delayed-release capsule. The primary end points for colonic transit were geometric center of the colonic counts at 24 hours and time for 50% ascending colon emptying. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the significance of the primary and secondary end points.

Results

Codeine delayed gastric, small-bowel, proximal, and overall colonic transit (P < .05). Alvimopan reversed codeine's effect on small bowel and colon (ascending colon and overall colonic transit). Alvimopan also accelerated overall colonic transit compared with placebo. Thus, the mean colonic geometric center at 24 hours was 2.33 with placebo/placebo, 3.25 with alvimopan/placebo (P < .05), 1.5 with placebo/codeine (P < .05), and 2.63 with alvimopan/codeine. Alvimopan did not reverse codeine's delay of gastric emptying.

Conclusions

Alvimopan reverses codeine's inhibitory effect on small-bowel and colon transit and has potential for treatment of opiate bowel dysfunction. Alvimopan alone accelerates colonic transit, suggesting that mu-opiate mechanisms participate in the physiologic control of colonic transit.

### Promethazine and phenylephrine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (promethazine VC with codeine oral solution) [^9893876a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.7 Muscle Relaxants

Codeine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Avoid the use of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution in patients taking muscle relaxants. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.

7.8 Diuretics

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.

7.9 Anticholinergic Drugs

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.

Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (eg, xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with promethazine.

7.10 Antihypertensive Drugs

Due to the antagonistic pharmacologic effects of phenylephrine, one of the active ingredients in Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution, the concomitant use of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution with antihypertensive drugs, including alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phentolamine); mixed alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists; calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine); ACE inhibitors; and centrally acting sympatholytic agents (eg, guanfacine, reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Use Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution with caution in patients who are taking antihypertensive drugs.

7.11 Interactions that Augment the Pressor
Effect of Phenylephrine

The concomitant use of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution with ergot alkaloids (eg, methylergonovine maleate); atropine sulfate; steroids (eg, hydrocortisone); angiotensin; aldosterone; norepinephrine transporter inhibitors (eg, atomoxetine); and tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the pressor response and increase the risk of hypertension. Use Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution with caution in patients who are taking such drugs.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^757e9e4d]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment approach for constipation — after discontinuing medications that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (ie, fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended before anorectal testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). NTC and STC can be safely managed with long-term use of laxatives (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
