## Question

Liver functioning monitoring after statin initiation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about liver function monitoring after starting statins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory and guideline evolution that changed practice. Then, I should verify the current consensus on baseline testing. Next, I will examine the evidence against routine on-treatment monitoring. After that, I need to check special populations where monitoring still matters. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and confirm thresholds for action if liver enzymes do rise.

> Let me first confirm the historical shift in recommendations, because I need to ensure I'm not anchoring on outdated practice. Initially, statin labels required periodic liver enzyme monitoring, but the FDA revised labeling in 2012 to recommend baseline liver tests before initiation and on-treatment testing only when clinically indicated, reflecting the rarity and unpredictability of serious statin hepatotoxicity and the lack of benefit from routine monitoring [^114B3QKe].

> Next, I should review the current consensus on baseline testing. Wait, let me verify that major guidelines align on this point. Contemporary AHA/ACC guidance supports obtaining baseline liver transaminases before starting statins, and AASLD explicitly recommends predosing liver biochemistries for all patients initiating statins, which establishes a reference point and helps identify preexisting liver disease that may influence monitoring decisions [^112c5Q38] [^112ePokM] [^115AbLKU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine on-treatment checks. I need to check the strength of evidence against periodic monitoring. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same conclusion: routine periodic liver enzyme monitoring after statin initiation is not recommended because statin-induced hepatotoxicity is rare, typically idiosyncratic, and not prevented by scheduled testing; instead, testing should be symptom-driven or context-driven, not calendar-driven [^112ePokM] [^114B3QKe] [^112c5Q38] [^113fCbNs].

> I will now examine the magnitude of risk to ensure I'm not underestimating it. Severe statin-associated liver injury occurs in roughly 1 per 100,000 patients, and persistent ALT elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal are uncommon in trials, on the order of 0.1–0.6% depending on dose and agent, with many elevations resolving despite continued therapy; importantly, routine monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury [^115HfXj2] [^117VDSBK] [^114B3QKe].

> But wait, what if the patient has underlying liver disease? I should confirm how that changes practice. In compensated chronic liver disease, including MASLD/NAFLD and compensated cirrhosis, statins are safe and often beneficial, and guidelines still advise obtaining baseline liver tests and then individualizing follow-up rather than routine periodic checks; in decompensated cirrhosis, statins should generally be avoided or used only with great caution and close monitoring due to hepatic metabolism and limited safety data [^112ePokM] [^111h8Frx] [^1126YTbT] [^111cGJzi] [^115iSbUt].

> Let me consider other special scenarios where I should double-check my threshold for testing. Patients with heavy alcohol use, active viral hepatitis, or those on interacting drugs may warrant closer surveillance, and some clinicians still obtain a 12-week check in higher-risk patients even though it is not mandated; in liver transplant recipients, dyslipidemia is common and statins are frequently used, but drug–drug interactions with immunosuppressants necessitate careful selection and monitoring, reinforcing the principle of targeted, not routine, testing [^115AbLKU] [^117Re16S] [^115cca3W].

> Next, I should review pediatric and adolescent guidance, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing adult recommendations. For children and adolescents on statins, expert panels recommend baseline ALT and AST with periodic rechecks during the first year and then every 6 months thereafter, reflecting a more conservative stance in pediatrics and the need to monitor growth and development alongside medication safety [^115AEB1W] [^111yqR1H] [^112J4YzG].

> I should confirm the practical, symptom-triggered approach. If a patient on a statin develops jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper quadrant pain, or unexplained fatigue, I should order a hepatic panel including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin to evaluate for hepatotoxicity; if ALT or AST exceed 3 times the upper limit of normal on two separate occasions, or if there is a concurrent rise in bilirubin, I should pause the statin, investigate alternative causes, and consider rechallenge at a lower dose or with a different statin once resolved, recognizing that many elevations are transient and benign [^112c5Q38] [^113fCbNs] [^116QP2em].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis aligns with the highest-quality guidance. The bottom line is that baseline liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients starting statins, but routine on-treatment monitoring is not recommended; instead, monitor when clinically indicated by symptoms, significant dose escalation, new interacting drugs, or underlying liver disease, and in decompensated cirrhosis, avoid statins or use only with extreme caution and close follow-up [^112ePokM] [^113hH75J] [^112c5Q38] [^1126YTbT].

---

Routine liver function monitoring after statin initiation is **not required** for asymptomatic patients [^114B3QKe] because serious hepatotoxicity is rare and routine testing does not improve detection or outcomes [^114B3QKe]. Obtain **baseline ALT/AST** before starting therapy [^112ePokM], then recheck only if symptoms of hepatotoxicity occur (jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain) [^112c5Q38] or if the dose is significantly increased [^116QP2em]. In patients with chronic liver disease, statins are generally safe [^115iSbUt]; monitor more closely in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure [^1126YTbT]. Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN warrants evaluation and consideration of dose reduction or discontinuation [^111Yh8sk].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major guidelines consistently recommend **baseline liver function tests (LFTs)** before initiating statin therapy [^112ePokM] [^112c5Q38], but **do not recommend routine on-treatment monitoring** unless clinically indicated [^114B3QKe] [^113fCbNs].

| **Guideline** | **Baseline LFTs** | **Routine on-treatment monitoring** | **Indications for on-treatment monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| AASLD | Recommended for all patients | Not recommended | - Symptoms of hepatotoxicity <br/> - Significant dose increase <br/> - Decompensated cirrhosis |
| AHA/ACC | Recommended | Not recommended | - Symptoms of hepatotoxicity <br/> - Significant dose increase |
| FDA | Recommended | Not recommended | - Symptoms of hepatotoxicity <br/> - Significant dose increase |

---

## Rationale for current recommendations

The shift away from routine monitoring reflects the **low incidence of serious hepatotoxicity** with statins and the lack of evidence that routine monitoring improves detection or prevention of significant liver injury [^114B3QKe] [^115HfXj2]. Key points include:

- **Low risk of serious hepatotoxicity**: Serious liver injury occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 patients [^115HfXj2], and routine monitoring does not reliably detect these rare events [^114B3QKe].

- **Transient elevations**: Mild, transient ALT/AST elevations (≤ 3× ULN) occur in 0.5–2% of patients [^117VDSBK] and often resolve spontaneously without intervention [^117VDSBK].

- **Lack of benefit**: Routine monitoring has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes or prevent serious liver injury [^114B3QKe] [^115HfXj2].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring on-treatment monitoring

While routine monitoring is not recommended, certain scenarios warrant **on-treatment LFTs**:

- **Symptoms of hepatotoxicity**: Jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain, or unexplained malaise [^112c5Q38].

- **Significant dose escalation**: Particularly with high-intensity statins or when switching to a different statin [^116QP2em].

- **Underlying liver disease**: Chronic liver disease, especially decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure [^1126YTbT].

- **Drug interactions**: Concurrent use of hepatotoxic or interacting medications (e.g. azole antifungals, macrolides, niacin) [^115yFuP4].

---

## Interpretation of liver function test results

When LFTs are performed, results should be interpreted in clinical context:

- **Mild elevations (≤ 3× ULN)**: Often transient and benign; consider continuation with close observation if asymptomatic [^117VDSBK].

- **Moderate elevations (3–5× ULN)**: Evaluate for alternative causes (e.g. alcohol, viral hepatitis, NAFLD) [^115LahNR]; consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if persistent [^111Yh8sk].

- **Severe elevations (> 5× ULN)**: Discontinue statin immediately and investigate alternative etiologies [^111Yh8sk].

---

## Special considerations

### Patients with chronic liver disease

Statins are generally safe and may even confer benefit in chronic liver disease, including NAFLD and compensated cirrhosis [^115iSbUt] [^116udLVk]. Routine monitoring is not required, but **closer surveillance is reasonable in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure** [^1126YTbT].

---

### Elderly patients

Elderly patients have a similar risk of hepatotoxicity to younger adults, and routine monitoring is not specifically recommended solely based on age [^112xVqk5]. Baseline LFTs are reasonable, with **on-treatment testing only if clinically indicated** [^114G6Gie].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Baseline LFTs**: Obtain ALT and AST before initiating statin therapy [^112ePokM].

- **Routine monitoring**: Not recommended for asymptomatic patients [^114B3QKe].

- **On-treatment testing**: Perform if symptoms of hepatotoxicity occur, with significant dose escalation, or in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure [^112c5Q38] [^1126YTbT].

- **Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN**: Evaluate alternative causes and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation [^111Yh8sk].

---

Routine liver function monitoring after statin initiation is **unnecessary for asymptomatic patients** [^114B3QKe]. Baseline LFTs should be obtained, with on-treatment testing reserved for specific clinical indications [^112c5Q38]. This approach balances safety with evidence-based practice and avoids unnecessary testing and potential harm from inappropriate statin discontinuation [^114B3QKe].

### An assessment by the statin liver safety task force: 2014 update [^115GVUte]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^114r5oB3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of lipid levels.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy, and then repeated 8–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment (Table 3). For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (ie, every 5 years) may be appropriate.

Table 3.
Laboratory assessment of patients with dyslipidemias

For biochemical monitoring for adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (< 3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. For those individuals with transaminase elevations > 3× ULN, using a lower starting dose of statin and monitoring transaminases at 4- to 12-week intervals during cautious up-titration may be reasonable. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed later.

If baseline CK is > 5 times ULN, some would advise refraining from statin initiation and considering alternative therapy because CK may rise even higher when a statin is introduced. However, if a patient has no risk factors for myopathy, CK does not need to be routinely monitored. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed in more detail later.

Statin use and monitoring in liver disease are delineated with specific recommendations. "Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease". Furthermore, "Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated", while in decompensated cirrhosis, "use of statins… should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit".

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^115gzAX7]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

There was virtually no evidence to support any recommendations regarding the frequency of ongoing monitoring once lipid-lowering therapies had been commenced. Guidelines that recommended retesting following statin initiation tended to additionally recommend liver function tests were performed as a safety indicator, especially if hepatic symptoms were present, including those produced by the ACC/AHA and the ESC/EAS. Guidelines frequently conflate the issue of short term safety bloods with longer term lipid monitoring when reporting the strength of evidence. Despite this, only one guideline (ACD) cited evidence that they considered to be strong in their recommendations. The evidence referenced would suggest that monitoring patients regularly is associated with improved adherence to medication, and, consequently, patient outcomes. However, this study was open to confounding due to its observational nature, and as far as we are aware, this has never been tested within a randomised controlled trial. Furthermore, the purpose of such follow-up testing in guidelines is seldom stated. Where evidence was cited, though, this would suggest that the purpose of such reviews is to promote adherence, but this may not be the rationale for all of the guidelines included, which could also include the monitoring of lipids to check if targets are still being achieved or of safety concerns. Regardless, the majority of guidelines recommended that secondary prevention patients were reviewed annually based purely on clinician's opinion. However, in the UK, simulations have suggested that this is likely to be optimal economically as well as reducing the impact of any natural variation in an individual's cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, some patients will not be optimally managed under these recommendations, and by integrating algorithms into electronic health records to aid clinical decision making, there is the potential to personalise an individual patient's lipid management.

### Early impact of the 2018 AHA / ACC / multisociety cholesterol guideline on lipid monitoring after statin initiation [^1141feXT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline emphasizes the need for lipid monitoring more strongly than the previous 2013 guideline to ensure patients reach recommended percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions. Real-world compliance to monitoring recommendations is currently unknown.

Objectives

This study examined the proportion of patients with a lipid panel measured within 3 months of statin initiation.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated University of Colorado Health primary care patients aged 18 to 89 years with a new statin prescription identified via the Epic Clarity database. Patients initiated on a statin during January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 and January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-2018 guideline cohort and the post-2018 guideline cohort, respectively. Patients with active liver disease, pregnancy, or missing demographic data were excluded.

Results

A total of 13,726 patients were included, 7476 in the preguideline cohort and 6250 in the postguideline cohort. A total of 13.9% of patients in the preguideline cohort had a lipid panel completed within 3 months of statin initiation compared with 16.2% in the postguideline cohort (adjusted P < .001). In the postguideline cohort, 56% (n = 857) of patients with lipid monitoring warranted a therapeutic intensification as recommended by the 2018 guideline; however, only 5% had their lipid-lowering regimen changed.

Conclusion

In a large integrated health system, lipid monitoring increased among patients newly started on statin therapy soon after release of the 2018 guideline but remains low. Clinical interventions are needed to improve lipid monitoring to optimize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy and ensure that guideline-recommended goals are achieved.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines — laboratory monitoring and hepatic safety state that in patients with statin-associated side effects, it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness; after baseline liver transaminases, the FDA recommends routine measurement of transaminases if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity; an asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect that often resolves with dose reduction or rechallenge, severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases, a thorough evaluation for nonstatin etiologies is warranted when significant transaminase elevation persists, and statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease.

### Is there value in liver function test and creatine phosphokinase monitoring with statin use? [^114L6dya]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Statins have transformed the care of patients with vascular disease. Patients in almost every category that has been studied have benefited substantially. On the other hand, although the incidence of side effects is remarkably low, statins, like any other therapy, are not entirely free of serious risks. From the outset, based on the mechanism of action of statins, hepatotoxicity has been a concern. Moreover, although the mechanisms remain obscure, significant skeletal muscle injury, which can lead to renal failure and death, unquestionably does occur. To mitigate these risks, screening and monitoring programs for hepatic and skeletal muscle injury were put in place when statins were introduced into clinical practice. This article reviews the benefits and the costs of these efforts. Although the benefits have not been shown, the costs are real and substantial. These include the harm caused by inappropriate withdrawal of therapy, which has been shown to be life-saving, as well as the considerable financial expenditure. The conclusion that follows, based on the evidence in hand, is that although these programs were appropriate at the time statins were introduced, they are not appropriate now.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115HfXj2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic adverse events with statins: Statins cause asymptomatic, dose-related transaminase elevations greater than 3 times ULN (ALT greater than AST) in up to 1% of patients in clinical trials, but severe liver disease usually does not develop; statins are safe in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including with modest elevations (< 3 times ULN), and statins may be safely initiated when needed in individuals with transaminase elevations up to 3 times ULN; severe liver injury is extremely rare, estimated at about 1 in 100 000 patients and not detectable in clinical trials, and monitoring of ALT and AST does not prevent severe liver disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for liver transplantation, more specifically with respect to post-transplant monitoring (lipid profile), AASLD/AST 2013 guidelines recommend to consider measuring blood lipids after a 14-hour fast annually for healthy LT recipients. An elevated LDL-C level > 100 mg/dL, with or without hypertriglyceridemia, requires therapy. Introduce statin therapy if therapeutic lifestyle and dietary changes are not enough. Suboptimal control with statins can be improved by the addition of ezetimibe.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

An exploratory analysis of the JUPITER trial compared outcomes in 5695 participants age 70–97 years to those age 50–69 years old. Within this older subgroup, rosuvastatin reduced major ASCVD events by 39% with favorable point estimates for cardiovascular death and total mortality and greater absolute reductions in major ASCVD events compared to the younger group. Assessment for adverse effects, and measurements of lipid values, liver function tests, and hemoglobin A1C occurred every six months. Serious adverse events were more common in older than younger patients, but similar between rosuvastatin and placebo within each age group. As discussed in Question 4, new onset T2DM was more common in the rosuvastatin group in older patients, but comparable to the increase seen in younger participants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed the recommendation for routine liver function test measurements with statin therapy in 2012. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend measurement of liver function tests at baseline and if there are signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during therapy. The guidelines further recommend a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms prior to statin treatment because such symptoms are common in the general adult population and especially in older individuals. Serum creatine kinase testing should be performed for patients with severe SAMS or muscle weakness during treatment. Monitoring of LDL‐C is recommended 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy or making statin dose adjustments and every 3 to 12 months thereafter as clinically indicated to monitor adherence and safety without distinctions by patient age. Among those with risk factors for the development ofT2DM, monitoring of hemoglobin A1C levels is also recommended. Clinicians should use these results and shared decision making to manage therapy to achieve patient‐specific therapeutic objectives.
The fundamental competent and practical steps of shared decision‐making include: information sharing, patient education, exploring patient preferences, decision support tools, deliberation and discussion, shared decision‐making agreement, and ongoing communication and review. Given limited evidence of improved ASCVD outcomes with statin therapy in adults age 75 years or older, including these patients in decision making about statin initiation, type of statin and statin intensity, and about continuation or discontinuation of therapy is important to reduce decisional conflict and ensure that therapy is consistent with patient priorities and preferences. Prospective randomized trials that utilized shared decision‐making with or without validated decision tools in younger patients have demonstrated reductions in decisional conflict and increased patient acceptance of statin therapy.as has provision of statistics addressing relative risk reduction in ASCVD events. The Mayo Clinic Statin Choice Decision Aid has been validated in clinical trials, and is available to facilitate shared decision‐making in clinical practice. Older adults with multimorbidity may face multiple preference‐sensitive decisions, and treatment of one condition may exacerbate another condition, making it impractical to use decision aids for each choice. A better approach to eliciting preferences among older adults with multimorbidity may be to ask patients to rank a set of universal health outcomes such as living as long as possible, preserving function, and alleviating pain and other symptoms. The clinician and patient can then consider these factors within the shared decision‐making process. Statin therapy could be considered in terms of how likely it is to help the patient achieve their most‐desired outcome or avoid their least‐desired outcome. Understanding a patient's priorities can help to inform the overall approach to medications, including statins.

Regarding medical management for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to other agents, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate or continue statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction as clinically indicated in adult patients with T2DM and compensated cirrhosis from MASLD. Be cautious when using statins in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and obtain close monitoring, given limited safety and efficacy data.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin safety — special populations and nonstatin therapy: In patients at increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. In patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe or recurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge, it is reasonable to use RCT proven nonstatin therapy that is likely to provide net clinical benefit.

Statins can significantly decrease serum lipid levels and have become a major tool in the effort to decrease rates of cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients. Statins occasionally cause muscle and liver toxicity, although these adverse events are rare. Liver toxicity usually is signaled by an asymptomatic increase in transaminase levels, but rare episodes of severe hepatotoxicity and liver damage have been reported. For this reason, statins have been contraindicated in patients with active liver disease and persistent elevated transaminase levels. Chalasani and associates performed a retrospective cohort analysis to determine if treatment of patients with increased transaminase levels conferred a higher risk of transaminase elevations.

Data from a large academic practice were used to identify the three cohorts: patients with elevated baseline liver enzyme levels who were given statins; patients with normal baseline liver enzyme levels who were given statins; and patients with elevated liver enzyme levels who were not given statins. Patients with evidence of alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis were omitted from the study. The liver chemistries of all patients were compared after six months. A "mild/moderate" elevation in liver enzyme levels was defined as an aspartate transaminase or an alanine transaminase level of up to 10 times the upper limit of normal baseline, or up to 10 times the baseline levels in patients with baseline elevations. The most commonly prescribed statins were atorvastatin and simvastatin. Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 had fewer mild/moderate enzyme level elevations, but rates of severe elevations were similar in the two groups.

There was no difference between cohorts 1 and 3 in the incidence of mild/moderate or severe elevations in liver enzyme levels. Variations in statin dosage did not affect these observations. The authors conclude that because the frequency of elevated liver enzyme levels in patients with baseline enzyme level elevations who were given statins was not different from that in similar patients who did not receive statins, elevated baseline liver enzyme levels may not confer increased risk of hepatotoxicity with statin use. Although the risk of liver injury with statin use is rare, and liver injury may even be caused by natural progression of liver disease unrelated to statin administration, more studies are necessary to clarify which patients are susceptible to drug-induced liver injury.

"Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^113kRxoa]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Practice recommendations — on-treatment monitoring and coadministration: Hepatic function panel testing should be obtained at baseline and at periodic intervals (eg, 3, 6, and 12 months) to determine response and adverse events while on resmetirom therapy, and resmetirom should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity develops as defined by the AASLD drug-induced liver injury practice guidance. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation on monitoring after 12 months of resmetirom treatment but continued monitoring with hepatic function panel testing every 6 months is suggested. Among persons with known thyroid disease, standard laboratory monitoring (eg, TSH and free T4) per established guidelines is recommended while receiving resmetirom therapy. Resmetirom can be used concurrently with statins; however, practitioners should be aware of the maximum recommended daily dosages, including atorvastatin 40 mg/d, pravastatin 40 mg/d, rosuvastatin 20 mg/d, and simvastatin 20 mg/d, and continued attention to comorbidity management including hyperlipidemia is recommended particularly if the statin dose is modified at the outset of resmetirom therapy.

HIV infection — statin safety monitoring and lipid patterns: Monitoring of statin side effects in the HIV-infected patients is similar to monitoring in the general population, and routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not recommended. Some clinicians order liver function tests approximately 1 month after prescribing statins, although the FDA does not recommend monitoring and suggests liver function be monitored only in patients with pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of liver toxicity. The most common lipid abnormality reported in persons with HIV is high triglycerides (TG) with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and infections are known to increase TG by decreasing clearance of circulating lipoproteins or by stimulating hepatic lipid synthesis or reesterification of fatty acids.

Frequency of monitoring

Thirteen guidelines detailed recommendations regarding the ongoing monitoring of this population, with the specifics falling into three categories: monitoring following the initiation of treatment (n = 5), monitoring prior to stable lipids (n = 2), and long-term follow-up (n = 11), with some providing recommendations in more than one of these categories (n = 5). Of those who detailed monitoring following statin initiation, all recommended a review of the patient's lipids within 3 months. Within these, two guidelines recommended also measuring the patient's alanine aminotransferase at this review, one suggested this should be conducted only if symptoms were present, and another two did not refer to this safety blood indicator. Furthermore, the measurement of creatine kinase was only considered where side effects were reported at this initial review, and was recommended in five of these guidelines, and implied in the remaining guideline. Meanwhile, for the guidelines which recommended monitoring prior to stability, the criteria for this were not clearly defined. Both CCSG and New Zealand Ministry of Health (NZ) did not detail a specific purpose for these reviews. In terms of long term follow-up, many recommended reviewing the patient annually (n = 9), although there was some variation in recommendations between 3 and 12 months.

The majority of guidelines considered the evidence behind their frequency of monitoring recommendations to either be low (n = 1) or gave no evidence to support them (n = 11), sometimes referring to them as good practice points or clinician's opinions or preferences (n = 5). However, the ACD guidelines were the exception to this, which graded the evidence behind their monitoring recommendations of every 3–12 months as strong.

Why Physicians Mistakenly Discontinue Statins

Reasons why physicians inappropriately discontinue or limit the dose of statins include commonly held myths about statin adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cognitive decline, cataracts, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In some cases, this may be driven by concern about litigation, when guidelines specify, for example, monitoring of liver function.

Although rare cases of true hepatotoxicity may exist, 1 statins probably do not cause hepatotoxicity, as stated in the 2013 International Atherosclerosis Society guideline. 18 Fluctuations in blood levels of transaminase enzymes that are often blamed on statins ("transaminitis") are more likely to be caused by fatty liver or by release of enzymes from muscle in patients with statin myopathy. 19, 20 In the Heart Protection Study, in which > 20 000 high‐risk patients were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo and were followed for 5 years, hepatotoxicity was undetectable. 21 Athyros et al 22 compared patients with and without abnormal liver function tests in the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study. They found that liver function tests actually improved among patients given statins, whereas they worsened in patients not given statins. Further, the cardiovascular benefit of statins was greater among patients with abnormal liver function tests than among patients with normal liver function tests at baseline. Their conclusion 22 was that "Statin treatment is safe and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild‐to‐moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease". Guidelines regarding monitoring of liver function in patients taking statins should be revised accordingly.

Guidance statements

51 Early detection of DILI is best achieved by educating patients to report untoward symptoms to their providers along with prospective clinical and laboratory monitoring with certain high-risk drugs like the ICIs, isoniazid, and methotrexate.
52 All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system at https://www.fda. gov/safet y/medwatch.
53 Transient elevations of serum liver enzymes can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and immunological adaptation.
54 The FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity and provide informative relevant documents and recommendations for surveillance that may be accessed online, including drug labeling and package inserts.
55 Recommendations for hepatotoxicity monitoring vary in detail, according to the background information available. Often, common sense must be applied and/or experts consulted.
56 Recommended monitoring for isoniazid hepatotoxicity includes patient education to report new symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy in many patients. However, many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals.
57 Annual measurement of liver elastography is recommended as a noninvasive means to monitor the hepatotoxicity of drugs like methotrexate that tend to cause silent fibrosis but is not likely applicable to most other drugs that cause DILI.
58 Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.
59 Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. However, use of statins in people with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit.
60 Predosing and on-treatment laboratory monitoring is the standard of care for oncology patients receiving ICIs with a series of steps to withhold the drug, increase laboratory monitoring, and use corticosteroids based on the severity of liver injury.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

Statins

There are seven 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methyl‐glutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or "statin" drugs that are used on a daily basis by millions of patients with hyperlipidemia. In general, statins are safe to administer, but myalgias and myopathy may lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients. Early on there was concern of self‐limited serum aminotransferase elevations in up to 20% of patient receiving statins, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction was very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1188 (1.8%) consecutively enrolled patients with DILI were attributed to a statin over an 8‐year period. Both acute cholestatic and hepatocellular injury were observed, as well as fewer patients with autoimmune features. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no significant increase in the incidence of persistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels between statin and placebo therapy, including in patients with known chronic liver disease.–In addition, other studies have suggested that statins in patients with compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may even reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer and decompensation. In 2012, the FDA altered the product labels of available statins so that baseline liver biochemistries be obtained but that on‐treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated. Therefore, we do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless there are new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis. However, statins should be avoided in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to their hepatic metabolism, but low doses can be considered on an individual basis after assessing overall risk versus benefit.

In an effort to provide internists and other primary care physicians with effective management strategies for diabetes care, the Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee (CEAS) of the American College of Physicians (ACP) decided to develop guidelines on the management of dyslipidemia, particularly hypercholesterolemia, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The CEAS commissioned a systematic review of the currently available evidence on the management of lipids in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The evidence review is presented in a background paper in this issue. On the basis of this systematic review, the CEAS developed recommendations that the ACP Board of Regents then approved as policy. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians who care for patients with type 2 diabetes. The target patient population is all persons with type 2 diabetes, including those who already have some form of microvascular complication and, of particular importance, premenopausal women. The recommendations are as follows. RECOMMENDATION 1: Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for all patients (both men and women) with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. RECOMMENDATION 2: Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular complications in patients (both men and women) with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. RECOMMENDATION 3: Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at least moderate doses of a statin. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances.

For children ages 8 and 9 years with LDL–C persistently ≥ 190 mg/dL after lifestyle/diet management together with multiple first-degree family members with premature cardiovascular disease/events or qualifying risk factors/conditions, statin therapy should be considered (Grade B). Statin use should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily; if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be increased by one increment (usually 10 mg), and if still not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be further increased by one increment; alternatively, a second agent such as a bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist (Grade B). Children taking a statin should have routine clinical monitoring for symptoms of muscle toxicity and assessment of hepatic transaminases and creatine kinase (Grade A). Pediatric care providers should be on the alert for, and children and families counseled about, potential medication interactions (Grade D).

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^112xVqk5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To date, there has been not enough evidence to indicate that the incidence of hepatotoxicity or elevation of aminotransferase levels is higher in elderly patients receiving statins compared with younger patients. After a year of follow-up of the 515 patients in our study, the data suggest that the total rate of persistent aminotransferase elevation is 4.7% (95% CI 2.7–6.6). There is no correlation between drug-induced liver injury and age, gender, biliary calculus, fatty liver, comorbidity, polypharmacy, or the statin variety. It is safe to use the standard dose of statins in patients aged 80 years or older. Recently, the FDA has recommended the revision of labeling instructions for statins and has suggested that routine monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking statins is unnecessary. However, in our opinion, monitoring liver function is necessary if the patient has chronic liver disease or a history of alcohol abuse.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities… [^115AbLKU]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of true liver injury caused by statin therapy is low. The dose-related elevations of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels observed in patients taking statins do not exceed those in patients taking placebo at low to moderate dosages and are modest at higher dosages. Many preexisting conditions that cause elevations in transaminase levels were once thought to be contraindications to statin therapy; however, statins do not worsen liver function in most patients with chronic liver disease. 1–7. Statins and the Liver Elevations in transaminase levels do not reflect hepatic injury per se; the best indicator of true liver injury is the serum bilirubin level.

3, 4 In another matched study of 2, 264 patients, those taking statins showed no differences in liver enzyme levels or progression of steatohepatitis compared with patients not taking statins. 13 A small study of 68 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease showed no change in liver enzymes but a statistically significant 46 percent reduction in the quantitative steatosis on repeat biopsy in the 17 patients taking statins at follow-up. 14 Two small studies evaluating patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis showed no change 15 or a reduction 12 in liver enzymes among those taking statins; both studies also demonstrated some degree of improvement in liver pathology. 5 and a prospective study of 320 patients taking pravastatin 6 found no evidence of increased hepatotoxicity among those with chronic liver disease.

A cohort study showed that patients with hepatitis C infection who took statins had less severe elevations in transaminase levels than patients with hepatitis C infection who were not on statins or those who took statins but tested negative for hepatitis C infection.
7. An expert consensus panel of hepatologists convened by the National Lipid Association concluded that chronic liver disease is not a contraindication to statin use. Although the panel also concluded that routine monitoring of liver function was not supported by the literature, for medicolegal reasons they recommended checking transaminase levels before initiating therapy, 12 weeks after initiating therapy or increasing the dosage, and periodically thereafter.

### Severe acute liver injury after hepatotoxic medication initiation in real-world data [^1157AW6W]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study has important implications for clinical care. Patients initiating a medication with a high rate of severe ALI might require closer monitoring of liver-related laboratory tests to detect evolving hepatic dysfunction earlier, which might improve prognosis. Within electronic health record systems, automated messages could alert clinicians ordering a high-risk medication to the potential for severe ALI and to consider laboratory monitoring. The results also provide real-world evidence of the hepatic safety of certain medications. For example, although some statins were included in category A or B based on reported cases of hepatotoxicity, rates of severe ALI for these medications were low (< 1.0 event per 10 000 person-years).

Our method of measuring rates of severe ALI after suspected hepatotoxic medication initiation could be applied within other electronic medical record data outside the VA system. The approach could be modified to identify new potentially hepatotoxic drugs by looking back from hospitalizations for severe ALI and examining associations with proximal medications. This method could also be expanded to examine other medication-related toxic effects on organs.

### Statins in acute coronary syndromes: do the guideline recommendations match the evidence? [^1171vKTk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

On the basis of the evidence obtained from observational studies, randomized controlled trials and their meta-analyses, current guidelines recommend initiating high-dose statin therapy pre-discharge regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Careful review of the evidence indicates that early initiation of high-dose statin therapy reduces recurrent ischemia and may reduce revascularization, but does not confer benefit in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as death or myocardial infarction in any of the randomized controlled trials, and may be associated with increased liver and muscle-related adverse outcomes leading to increased withdrawal and suboptimal long-term adherence. A mortality benefit is apparent in pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials only at long-term (24-month) but not short-term (4-month) follow-up. The critical role of the timing of initiation of therapy (early vs. late) on the benefit-risk profile of statin treatment has not been systematically assessed. It is unclear whether the clinical benefits are attributable to lipid-lowering or lipid-lowering-independent effects. Finally, an optimal LDL threshold for initiating treatment or target LDL level for treatment in ACS remains yet to be defined. On the basis of these observations, and despite a compelling pathophysiologic rationale, the justification for current Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation for statin therapy in patients with ACS remains open to question.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^116S7YG6]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Laboratory

Q: What laboratory tests help to confirm a diagnosis of statin intolerance?

Dr. Sperling: There is no test that typically confirms a diagnosis of statin intolerance, and this is one of the reasons that it is such a difficult clinical entity to address.

Dr. Wong: Obtaining adequate baseline information on current muscle and other symptoms before a patient begins a statin is important, as symptoms are often erroneously attributed to the statin when they were actually present beforehand.

Some papers in the literature suggest that measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is most appropriate for a patient workup, after symptoms of intolerance have emerged.

Some physicians prefer to obtain a baseline CK for comfort, whereas others claim that with a baseline CK, you may end up pursuing the enzyme forever.

Changes in CK levels can occur daily, and CK is not a diagnostic tool. Although there is a general tendency not to look at CK levels in the absence of a specific complaint, a CK measurement 1 to 2 days following intense exercise may be appropriate to see what the highest values might be.

Myositis (defined as muscle inflammation) seems to be associated with exercise, and almost without exception with CK elevations; myalgia (defined as muscle pain) can be relatively nondescript and is seldom associated with CK elevation.

Patients are interested in their liver enzymes. It is recommended that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements be done at baseline and then be repeated, but there is little need for ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes unless warranted.

The ALT and AST levels are measured to determine if a patient is developing liver damage, or even liver failure, which may occur idiosyncratically in 1 in a million patients. This is the same incidence that is seen in patients who are not on statins, so a physician might ask what is really being accomplished by obtaining these measurements. It should be noted that ALT and AST will often increase transiently and harmlessly during the first few weeks of statin therapy.

It should also be noted that some patients may be heavy drinkers, and this may confuse the issue with regard to liver function testing.

### PES lipid SIG diabetes and lipids algorithm [^113vyE4G]. PES (2024). High credibility.

Statin initiation — PES Lipid SIG Diabetes and Lipids Algorithm directs to counsel about adverse effects and interactions, obtain baseline labs, start a statin, and then monitor and titrate with defined toxicity thresholds and pediatric approvals. Steps include: "Obtain baseline labs: ALT, AST, CK" after "Counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, adherence", then "Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks, LDL-C at goal?" If yes and no toxicity, "Continue current therapy, and monitor per page 1, "Diabetes and lipids" algorithm". If toxicity, "Stop statin, recheck labs in 2 weeks, if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting lower dose or with different statin". If not at goal, "Assess/ensure compliance, titrate statin", and "recheck every 4 weeks until at goal LDL-C level", and "If continues to not be at goal and on maximal dosing, consider adding or switching to another agent, see "Beyond Statin" algorithm". Safety notes specify "Toxicity = AST, ALT > 3× ULN, or CK > 10× ULN (check CK if concern for myopathy)" and dose-response "2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C". Side effect and interaction cautions are listed, and pediatric approval is stated: "Currently statins are approved for children starting age 7 years for HoFH and age 8 years for HeFH".

### The liver and lovastatin [^117DgUkh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The cholesterol-lowering agents, known as statins, have been in use for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and premarketing clinical trials have given signals of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) levels. For that reason, all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs have labeling that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. Postmarketing experience, however, suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and thus it is timely to revisit the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has acquired 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor elevations in liver enzymes, i.e. ALT 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients on lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These elevations are reversible with continuing therapy, are dose related, and are probably related to cholesterol lowering per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-treatment years, which is 9% of the background rate of all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate of idiopathic ALF. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing serious liver disease, largely because of its rarity and the poor predictive value of minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk because of needless discontinuation of cholesterol-lowering therapy for false-positive results in patients who are benefiting from treatment.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116s5cFx]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy — indications, dosing, monitoring, and counseling in children are specified as follows. If LDL–C remains ≥ 130 to 159 mg/dL after a trial of lifestyle/diet management (CHILD 1 → CHILD 2–LDL) in a child age 10 years or older or with specified combinations of high- and moderate-level risk factors or risk conditions, then statin therapy should be considered (Grade C). For children ages 8 and 9 years with LDL–C persistently ≥ 190 mg/dL after lifestyle/diet management together with multiple first-degree family members with premature CVD/events or defined high- or moderate-level risk factor combinations, statin therapy should be considered (Grade B). Statin use should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily; if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be increased by one increment (usually 10 mg), and if still not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be further increased by one increment. Alternatively, a second agent such as a bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist (Grade B). Children taking a statin should have routine clinical monitoring for symptoms of muscle toxicity and assessment of hepatic transaminases and creatine kinase (Grade A); pediatric care providers should be on the alert for, and families should be counseled about, potential medication interactions (Grade D). Females taking a statin should be counseled about risks associated with pregnancy and appropriate contraception strategies if indicated, and use of oral contraceptives in combination with statins is not contraindicated (Grade D).

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^112QSXWb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — Guidance statements include: statins are safe and recommended for CVD risk reduction in patients with NAFLD across the disease spectrum, including compensated cirrhosis; limited data exist on the safety and efficacy of statins in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, although statin use with careful monitoring could be considered in patients with high CVD risk; hypertriglyceridemia can be managed through lifestyle changes and supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates; patients at high risk for NASH and advanced fibrosis should be screened for advanced fibrosis; and patients with NAFLD should be screened for the presence of T2DM.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^117VDSBK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Elevation in liver enzymes

Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients on any statin, usually within 3 months of initiation of therapy. This may not differ significantly from placebo, and in isolation, is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs involving more than 246 000 patients reported that statins as a class produced ∼50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relationship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations were transient, and usually normalized with continuing therapy. Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials involving more than 14 000 patients, reported persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases [> 3× upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo (Table 4).

Table 4
Summary of evidence for possible adverse effects of statin treatment on hepatic function

In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in worsening of liver disease, although caution may be needed in patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force guidelines. Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than 120 000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation and mortality, and possibly reduced portal hypertension. Statins should not be prescribed, however, in patients with active hepatitis B virus infection until serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, and ALP have normalized.

### How I approach optimization of patients at risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications after CAR T-cell therapy [^111DeqDr]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

A few other considerations in the peri-CAR T-cell period for patients with cardiac history include the initiation or transition to short-acting antihypertensives for uncontrolled or preexisting hypertension because of the high risk of hypotension during CRS. The use of statin therapy is balanced against the potential of post-CAR T-cell elevation of liver function tests, so their use may be deferred in the acute peri-CAR T-cell setting. Finally, as with the patient described earlier, among patients with heart failure, we consider optimization of goal-directed therapy (including considering a beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, if tolerable). However, similar to the case described earlier, many of these therapies are long acting, and the risk of hypotension has to be weighed. At the time of lymphodepletion, we monitor patients closely for thrombocytopenia and hold anticoagulation for patients who are at high risk for thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50 × 10³/μL) or have evidence of impending cytopenias. Before restarting these agents, we monitor patients closely for stability of their platelet counts and coagulopathy (because of CRS, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome, or liver dysfunction). For patients with thrombocytopenia who require anticoagulation for indications such as acute thrombosis, we consider resuming anticoagulation first with either unfractionated heparin drip or split-dose low molecular weight heparin, especially if there is a high risk of them developing delayed cytopenias or coagulopathy. When no complications are observed, and platelets are deemed to be adequate, long-acting anticoagulants can be considered. Although we usually use a cutoff for platelet counts > 50 × 10³/μL, close monitoring for signs of bleeding and renal and liver dysfunction is important, and a discussion with the hematology team might be useful to guide the therapy and choice of anticoagulant.

### Statin initiation following coronary artery bypass grafting: outcome of a hospital discharge protocol [^114jf7kJ]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate the outcome of a hospital discharge statin drug therapy initiation protocol following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Our goal was to measure the percentage of patients receiving statin drugs at hospital discharge and at a post-hospital discharge assessment following the implementation of the statin drug therapy initiation protocol. We also evaluated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal attainment (ie, < 100 mg/dL), safety monitoring, and tolerability of the statin drug.

Design

Single-center, observational study with a historical control group.

Setting

University-affiliated health system with a comprehensive heart care program that included a 14-bed cardiac surgery ICU. Approximately 400 CABG procedures are performed annually.

Patients

Patients who underwent CABG surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: contraindications to statin therapy; refusal to take a statin drug; refusal to give informed consent; and age < 18 years.

Intervention

A protocol was implemented to recommend treatment with a statin drug at hospital discharge in all post-CABG surgery patients if the presurgical LDL-C level was > 100 mg/dL or the patient was receiving a statin prior to hospital admission. The protocol also included a presurgical assessment of lipoprotein levels and hepatic function. All cardiac surgery staff were educated regarding the specifics of the protocol.

Results

A total of 403 patients were included in the study. The historical control group (202 subjects) and the intervention group (201 subjects) were similar with respect to gender, age, and baseline lipoprotein levels. The follow-up assessment interval was approximately 6 months in both groups. Overall, patients were more likely to receive a statin at hospital discharge in the intervention group compared to the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 2.0). Attainment of the goal for LDL-C level was similar between the intervention and control groups in the overall sample. Patients who were not at their LDL-C goal at baseline were more likely to have a follow-up LDL-C level of < 100 mg/dL in the intervention group (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5). The rate of liver function assessment was similar in the control and intervention groups. No patients in either group experienced elevations of alanine aminotransferase levels that were more than three times the upper limit of normal, and no cases of muscle toxicity were noted.

Conclusion

The initiation of therapy with a statin drug at hospital discharge following CABG surgery was associated with increased utilization rates. The LDL-C goal attainment improved in patients who were not at their goal prior to surgery. However, the persistence of medication use declined within 6 months. Statin therapy initiation was well-tolerated in this cohort of patients.

PES Lipid SIG — statin initiation and monitoring in youth requires to counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, and adherence; obtain baseline ALT, AST, and CK; and then start a statin, followed by reassessment at 4 weeks with LDL-C goal tracking and toxicity checks. If LDL-C is at goal without toxicity, continue current therapy and monitor as directed; if not at goal, assess/ensure compliance and titrate statin, rechecking every 4 weeks, and if still not at goal on maximal dosing consider adding or switching to another agent. If signs of toxicity occur, stop statin, recheck labs in 2 weeks, and if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting at a lower dose or with a different statin; if intolerance persists, see the "Beyond Statin" algorithm. Safety and use notes include side effects and interactions, formal contraindications including pregnancy and nursing, pediatric approval ages, and explicit toxicity thresholds; the document also states a dose–response relationship that 2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C and defines toxicity as AST, ALT > 3x ULN, or CK > 10x ULN, with pediatric approvals at age 7 years for HoFH and age 8 years for HeFH.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^116AtZym]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^111yqR1H]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy in children and adolescents — initiation and titration (laboratory thresholds and dose escalation) specifies that after 4 weeks, fasting lipid profile (FLP), ALT, and AST are measured and compared with laboratory-specific reported normal values; the threshold for worrisome ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of reported normal; and target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) levels are minimal < 130 mg/dL and ideal < 110 mg/dL. If target LDL–C levels are achieved without potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, therapy is continued and FLP, ALT, and AST are rechecked in 8 weeks and then 3 months. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, the medication is temporarily withheld and blood work repeated in 2 weeks, with restart when abnormalities resolve and close monitoring. If target LDL–C levels are not achieved, the dose is increased by one increment (usually 10 mg) and blood work repeated in 4 weeks; if still not achieved, the dose may be increased again or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^114KPsy9]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: What are your thoughts on the findings of theTask Force on Statin Intolerance?

The NLA Statin Intolerance Task Force has similarly presented a pragmatic definition of statin intolerance: "Adverse symptoms, signs and/or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient and/or provider to a statin, and perceived by the patient to interfere with daily life activities". These include predominantly muscle‐related symptoms, with muscle aches being the most common, but also may include other symptoms, liver‐enzyme increases, and isolated muscle‐enzyme increases.

Importantly, the NLA has included the phrase "real or perceived" in further describing these symptoms.

The NLA provides practical, patient‐centered recommendations that serve as an important augmentation to the ACC/AHA Guidelines.

The NLA Task Force concluded that statin intolerance requires a patient‐centered approach in practice; reducing the dose of statin, switching to a different statin, and alternate regimens, such as every‐other‐day dosing, are recommended for patients with statin intolerance. For patients who cannot tolerate a statin using the above strategies, alternate agents alone or in combination may be considered; innovative approaches to research on statin intolerance are needed.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

- Restrict alcohol intake to less than 30 g per day (< 20 g/day in women). Avoid alcohol consumption in case of high triglyceride levels

In view of its broad spectrum lipid-modulating actions in atherogenic dyslipidaemia (Box 2), niacin may be of special value for reducing TRL and their remnants concomitant with raising HDL-C levels among patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities, particularly those with insulin resistance. However, definitive data from AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE are needed. Niacin is also unique in lowering Lp(a) levels. Treatment with niacin is supported by clinical evidence of stabilization or regression of atherosclerosis in clinical trials (see Niacin subsection). In practice, plasma glucose and urate levels should be monitored regularly for the possibility of hyperglycaemia and hyperuricaemia, respectively, and liver function tests should be monitored to exclude hepatotoxicity. In patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, lifestyle modification is the first option to control glucose, and if niacin is introduced glucose levels should be monitored.

The current level of evidence for clinical outcomes benefits and safety suggests that fenofibrate may be the preferred fibrate for combination with a statin, and may also have particular value in T2DM patients with mild-to-moderate retinopathy. From a safety perspective, pre-treatment serum transaminases, creatine (phospho)kinase, and creatinine should be measured. Creatine (phospho)kinase should be repeated if myalgia is reported, or there are known risk factors for myopathy, and treatment discontinued if levels exceed five times the upper limit of normal and/or symptoms are severe. Alanine and aspartate transaminases should be monitored 3 months after starting therapy and annually thereafter, but more frequently if the dose of statin is uptitrated. Serum creatinine should be monitored with statin–fenofibrate combinations.

If patients are intolerant of both niacin and fenofibrate, a high dose of omega-3 fatty acids ethyl esters may be considered. In patients with very high triglycerides (> 5.5 mmol/L or 490 mg/dL), fenofibrate, niacin, or high-dose omega-3 fatty acids (3–4 g/day), together with a very low fat diet (< 10% of calorie intake) and reduced alcohol intake, are recommended to prevent acute pancreatitis consistent with current guidelines.

### Frequency of disparities in laboratory testing after statin initiation in subjects ≥ 65 Years [^113uYTUM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing is important for the safety of older adults initiating statins, but there has been little examination of laboratory testing disparities by race/ethnicity, age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and multimorbidity. The study's purpose was to examine disparities in guideline-concordant baseline laboratory testing and abnormal laboratory values among a retrospective cohort of 76,868 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 10 states in the eastern United States who had dyslipidemia and initiated a statin from July 1 to November 30, 2011. Guideline-concordant assessment of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was defined as evidence of an outpatient claim for either test within 180 days before or 14 days after the date of the index statin fill. In 2011, baseline laboratory testing rates were 89.3% for ALT and 88.8% for AST. Older adults were somewhat more likely to have ALT and AST testing if they were dually enrolled in Medicaid (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.02) or had multiple chronic conditions (relative risk 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06 for 2 to 3 conditions; odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.11 for 4 to 5 conditions; OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.17 for 6+ conditions), compared with 0 to 1 conditions. Non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to receive baseline testing (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98) than non-Hispanic Whites, and male beneficiaries were somewhat less likely to receive testing than female beneficiaries (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 0.99). Abnormal values were rare. In conclusion, ALT and AST assessment after statin initiation was commonly done as recommended, and there were negligible disparities in testing rates for beneficiaries.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^115yFuP4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of VYTORIN [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with VYTORIN. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including VYTORIN.

In three placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3× ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.7% overall for patients treated with VYTORIN and appeared to be dose-related with an incidence of 2.6% for patients treated with VYTORIN 10/80. In controlled long-term (48-week) extensions, which included both newly-treated and previously-treated patients, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3× ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.8% overall and 3.6% for patients treated with VYTORIN 10/80. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

In SHARP, 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive VYTORIN 10/20 mg daily (n = 4650), or placebo (n = 4620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of consecutive elevations of transaminases (> 3× ULN) was 0.7% for VYTORIN and 0.6% for placebo.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.

Consider liver enzyme testing before VYTORIN initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. VYTORIN is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue VYTORIN.

5.4	Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including VYTORIN. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^1177a66J]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association pediatric dyslipidemia — treatment thresholds, goals, and monitoring notes that age-appropriate, percentile-based cutpoints from the 2011 Expert Panel should be considered as upper limits for therapeutic atherogenic cholesterol goal ranges, specifying Non-HDL-C: 144 mg/dL and LDL-C: 129 mg/dL. For pediatric FH patients in whom an LDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL may not be achievable, an alternate goal is a 50% reduction in LDL-C. Diet and other lifestyle interventions, including increased physical activity and weight management when overweight/obesity is present, are recommended for lowering elevated LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and TG. Children ≥ 8 years of age are potential candidates for pharmacologic lipid lowering; treatment plans can be considered including administration of pharmacologic agents, primarily statins, when LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL and/or non-HDL-C is ≥ 220 mg/dL, with additional risk factors considered and use of the 2011 Expert Panel algorithm. Statins and bile acid sequestrants have evidence for efficacy and safety in children and adolescents, whereas there is limited evidence on cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Consideration should be given to pretreatment fasting glucose or glycated hemoglobin, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase when a statin is prescribed, and potential side effects of lipid-altering pharmacotherapy should be monitored according to the 2014 NLA statin safety task force.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^116QP2em]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

In the pooled analysis of the 24-week controlled trials, persistent
transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8% and 4.9% of patients treated with
Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) 80 mg, Lescol 40 mg and
Lescol 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with Lescol
XL the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with
Lescol XL 80 mg.

It is recommended that liver function tests be
performed before the initiation of therapy and at 12 weeks following initiation
of treatment or elevation in dose. Patients who develop transaminase
elevations or signs and symptoms of liver disease should be monitored to confirm
the finding and should be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests
until the levels return to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of three
times the upper limit of normal or greater persist (found on two consecutive
occasions) withdrawal of fluvastatin sodium therapy is recommended.

Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are
contraindications to the use of Lescol and Lescol XL (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Caution should be exercised when fluvastatin sodium is administered to patients
with a history of liver disease or heavy alcohol ingestion (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism). Such
patients should be closely monitored.

### An assessment by the statin intolerance panel: 2014 update [^116F8k6U]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

This article from the National Lipid Association Statin Intolerance Panel provides a framework for understanding statin intolerance and makes general recommendations for health professionals. For specific guidance on adverse events related to muscle, liver, cognition, and glucose metabolism, one should refer to the other reports of the Statin Safety Task Force for those topics. Although statin adverse effects rarely lead to permanent sequelae, symptomatic intolerance frequently hinders cardiovascular risk reduction by statins. We emphasize here the advisory role of the clinician helping each patient to make personal decisions on statin tolerability. We identify a pressing need for further research on statin intolerance and make suggestions for research design.

Acitretin initiation and monitoring — baseline and follow-up testing are specified as follows: Patients should have a full history and physical examination before beginning acitretin, and baseline laboratory studies should include fasting cholesterol and triglycerides, renal and liver function tests, and pregnancy tests in women; if acitretin is used in women of child-bearing potential, baseline and monthly pregnancy testing is essential. After initiation of treatment, patients should be closely monitored to avoid serious adverse effects, and fasting lipid profile and liver enzyme testing should be performed monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months. Triglyceride-lowering medications, such as a fibrate, may be necessary for elevated lipid levels, and because patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, physicians should recommend lifestyle changes that reduce hyperlipidemia in patients taking acitretin.

### Lipid SIG algorithms [^111Jnphu]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Statin initiation — pediatric lipid management directs to counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, and adherence; obtain baseline labs (ALT, AST, CK); and start statin, then recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks and determine if LDL-C is at goal. If toxicity is present, stop statin, recheck labs in 2 weeks, and if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting lower dose or with different statin; if tolerated and at goal, continue current therapy and monitor per page 1, 'Diabetes and lipids' algorithm. If not at goal, assess/ensure compliance and titrate statin; if the patient continues to not tolerate statins, see the 'Beyond Statin' algorithm; otherwise assess/ensure compliance, titrate statin again and recheck every 4 weeks until at goal LDL-C level, and if still not at goal on maximal dosing consider adding or switching to another agent per the 'Beyond Statin' algorithm. Safety notes specify side effects (muscle pain/cramp, weakness, myopathy), potential medication interactions (cyclosporine, niacin, fibric acid derivative, erythromycin, azole antifungal, HIV protease inhibitor), and contraindications (pregnancy with teratogenicity; also nursing mothers, acute liver disease, hypersensitivity to statin); pediatric scope and toxicity thresholds are currently statins are approved for children starting age 7 years for hoFH and age 8 years for HeFH, with toxicity defined as AST, ALT > 3× ULN, or CK > 10× ULN (check CK if concern for myopathy), and dose–response guidance notes 2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eJLE3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Use of hepatotoxic drugs

A wide variety of drugs are associated with liver disease, and a requirement for the monitoring of liver functions may be documented. In this systematic review the drugs most commonly implicated included: carbamazepine, methyldopa, minocycline, macrolide antibiotics, nitrofurantoin, statins, sulfonamides, terbinafine, chlorpromazine and methotrexate. In addition, drugs can cause fatty liver and steatohepatitis and vascular injury. Methotrexate treatment requires special care, to prevent dose-dependent liver fibrosis, and non-invasive markers of fibrosis should be monitored. Although statins can lead to drug-induced liver injury, this is very rare, with studies demonstrating they are safe in patients with pre-existing abnormal liver enzymes.

On occasions it can be difficult to establish the relative contribution of a drug or drugs alongside possible concomitant liver disease. In this situation clinical judgement needs to be exercised to determine what is the major contributor and the need to discontinue medication. This will be influenced by the pattern of liver blood tests, the timing of medication use with respect to the liver blood abnormality developing and the clinical setting.

Family history of liver diseases

Investigating the relatives of patients with familial diseases, including haemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, would be an indication for the specific relevant tests: ferritin and transferrin saturation, haemochromatosis genotype, caeruloplasmin and urinary copper.

Liver enzymes are a poor guide to the development of progressive liver fibrosis in alcohol-related liver disease, but elevated enzymes, of which GGT is the best predictor of mortality, can be useful aids to behaviour change. The current NICE recommendation is to screen for advanced liver disease using Fibroscan in patients drinking at harmful levels (50 units/week in men and 35 units/week in women), and there is emerging evidence that a diagnosis of liver fibrosis can be an effective stimulus for behaviour change.

Viral hepatitis

Viral hepatitis may be associated with non-specific symptoms, including fatigue, which may be severe, but the majority of patients are symptom free and identified as a result of risk factors, including country of origin or parental exposure. While liver blood tests can give an indication of necro-inflammation or of advanced fibrosis, a key early test is serology for viral hepatitis in high-risk groups, such as people who inject drugs, migrants from high-prevalence areas, prisoners, as liver blood tests can be normal in this setting (Table 2).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — monitoring in response to LDL-C–lowering therapy states that adherence to lifestyle changes and effects of LDL-C–lowering medication should be assessed by fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter (Class I, Level A). Goals for LDL-C lowering are defined by percentage responses, and clinical efficacy is monitored by percentage reduction in LDL-C relative to baseline, which can be estimated by pretreatment measurements, chart reviews, or after a short interruption of therapy. Good adherence to LDL-lowering diets typically reduces LDL-C by 10% to > 15%, moderate-intensity statins by another 30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥ 50%.

### Therapy. statins and liver disease: from concern to' wonder' drugs? [^116udLVk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The benefits of statins go beyond decreasing cholesterol levels; in liver disease, statins reduce the risk of progressive liver fibrosis and provide protection during infections and ischaemia–reperfusion injury. New evidence shows that statins improve response to interferon-based anti-HCV therapy, decrease progression to cirrhosis and likelihood of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering therapy monitoring — adherence to changes in lifestyle and effects of LDL-C–lowering medication should be assessed by measurement of fasting lipids and appropriate safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter based on need to assess adherence or safety.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring in response to LDL-C–lowering therapy — adherence and effects should be checked by measurement of fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter, and the maximum percentage change will occur by 4 to 12 weeks after starting a statin or combined therapy. Good adherence to LDL-lowering diets will reduce LDL-C by 10% to > 15%; moderate-intensity statins can be expected to reduce LDL-C by another 30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥ 50%; adding ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants to a statin typically provides an additional 15% to 25% reduction in LDL-C, with much greater additive reductions when a PCSK9 inhibitor is added to statin plus ezetimibe.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults… [^1166TWF4]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The NICE guideline also uses a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or greater as the trigger for statin therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA guideline recommends a threshold of 7. 5% or greater. 1–4 The ACC/AHA also recommends that patients with a 10-year risk between 5. 0% and
7. 5% be considered for statin therapy. Recommendations for statin initiation based on these guidelines are shown in Figure 1. 1–3. Although the ACC/AHA and NICE guidelines do not recommend treating to lipid goals, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends checking lipid levels four to 12 weeks after initiation of statins to determine a patient's adherence and every three to 12 months thereafter as clinically indicated. The NICE guideline recommends checking lipid levels three months after starting statins, but not routinely after that. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins. However, guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms.

Both guidelines emphasize that shared decision making is essential to any treatment plan. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration provided further evidence in support of statin use for primary prevention of ASCVD events. The meta-analyses of 27 studies, using individual participant data from the majority of statin trials, demonstrated a reduction in major ASCVD events associated with statin use in low-risk individuals. The ACC's ECDP acknowledges a gap in evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating benefit when adding nonstatins to statin therapy in patients with stable clinical ASCVD who have not achieved an expected response to a statin. 48 However, statin use may not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in patients on dialysis.

49 For patients with chronic kidney disease, there is evidence to support the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy. The SHARP trial found reductions in ischemic strokes and coronary revascularization with ezetimibe/simvastatin compared with placebo over five years in patients with chronic kidney disease. 50 Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be recommended for primary prevention in patients with stage 3b or more severe chronic kidney disease.

### Safety announcement… [^114B3QKe]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Monitoring Liver Enzymes Labels have been revised to remove the need for routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking statins. The labels now recommend that liver enzyme tests should be performed before starting statin therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. FDA has concluded that serious liver injury with statins is rare and unpredictable in individual patients, and that routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing serious liver injury.
- Healthcare professionals should perform liver enzyme tests before initiating statin therapy in patients and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment, therapy should be interrupted. If an alternate etiology is not found, the statin should not be restarted.
- Increases in glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statin use.
- Healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in the lovastatin label regarding drugs that may increase the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when used with lovastatin. 1, 2 The Liver Expert Panel stated that the available scientific evidence does not support the routine monitoring of liver biochemistries in asymptomatic patients receiving statins. The Panel made this recommendation because irreversible liver damage resulting from statins is exceptionally rare and is likely idiosyncratic in nature, and no data exist to show that routine periodic monitoring of liver biochemistries is effective in identifying the very rare individual who may develop significant liver injury from ongoing statin therapy.

The Panel believed that routine periodic monitoring will instead identify patients with isolated increased aminotransferase levels, which could motivate physicians to alter or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events. 1 The National Lipid Association's Statin Task Force also stated that routine monitoring of liver function tests is not supported by the available evidence.
2. 3 Of these 133 patients, 15 were taking statins, and in six of these 15 individuals a statin was identified as the only potential drug to cause drug-induced liver injury. Based on all available data, FDA has determined that all currently marketed statins appear to be associated with a very low risk of serious liver injury and that routine periodic monitoring of serum alanine aminotransferase does not appear to detect or prevent serious liver injury in association with statins.

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^115ZGRBR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2 controlled clinical studies in 1,105 patients, the 12-month incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevation without regard to drug relationship was 0.9% and 2.1% at the 40- and 80-mg dose, respectively. No patients developed persistent liver function abnormalities following the initial 6 months of treatment at a given dose.

It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with FLOLIPID, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart FLOLIPID. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of simvastatin.

Moderate (less than 3× ULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with simvastatin. These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with simvastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and did not require interruption of treatment.

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.

### Baseline laboratory monitoring of cardiovascular medications in elderly health maintenance organization enrollees [^116jgveD]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify correlates of laboratory monitoring errors in elderly health maintenance organization (HMO) members at the initiation of therapy with cardiovascular medications.

Design

Cross-sectional study in 10 HMOs.

Setting

United States.

Participants

From a 2 million-member sample, individuals aged 65 and older who received one of seven cardiovascular medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), amiodarone, digoxin, diuretics, potassium supplements, and statins) and did not have recommended baseline monitoring performed during the 180 days before or 14 days after the index dispensing.

Measurements

The proportion of members receiving each drug for whom recommended laboratory monitoring was not performed. Laboratory monitoring error rates stratified by sex, age group, chronic disease score, and HMO site were examined, and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of laboratory monitoring errors.

Results

Error rates varied by medication class, ranging from 23% of patients receiving potassium supplementation without serum potassium and serum creatinine monitoring to 58% of patients receiving amiodarone who did not have recommended monitoring for thyroid and liver function. Highest error rates occurred in the youngest elderly for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, digoxin, diuretics, and potassium supplements, although in patients receiving amiodarone and statins, errors were most frequent in the oldest elderly. Errors occurred more frequently in patients with less comorbidity.

Conclusion

Laboratory monitoring errors occurred frequently in elderly HMO members at the initiation of therapy with cardiovascular medications. Further study must examine the association between these errors and adverse outcomes.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 Years after release of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association (ACC / AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^111P7FJK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. 1 One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. 1 With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Statin benefit groups identified in the 2013/cholesterol management guideline./indicates American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association;, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Several studies have been conducted since the guideline was introduced in an attempt to identify the potential impact of the guideline. In studies evaluating statin prescribing in which the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was determined by coronary imaging, a greater proportion of patients were eligible for a statin based on the ACC/AHA guideline compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline. 2, 3 Chia et al compared the Pooled Cohort Risk Score with actual practice data from 1998 to 2007 and found that statin use would need to increase under the new guideline. 4, 5 Preguideline data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008–2012) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005 to 2010 were assessed to estimate the impact of the guideline on statin practice patterns. This analysis found that compliance with the new guideline should result in a meaningful increase in statin use, especially in the group of patients with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. 6, 7

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112J4YzG]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy in children and adolescents — maintenance monitoring includes monitoring growth (height, weight, and body mass index relative to normal growth charts), sexual maturation, and development; stopping medication and assessing CK whenever potential myopathy symptoms present; and laboratory surveillance with FLP, ALT, and AST every 3–4 months during the first year, every 6 months during the second year and beyond, and whenever clinically indicated. Compliance with lipid-lowering diet and medication is monitored with serial assessment and counseling for other risk factors, and adolescent females are counseled about statin contraindications in pregnancy and the need for abstinence or use of appropriate contraception; use of oral contraceptives is not contraindicated if medically appropriate, with referral to adolescent medicine or gynecologic specialists as appropriate.
