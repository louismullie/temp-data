## Question

Cardiorespiratory arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiorespiratory arrest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and epidemiology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why outcomes are poor. Next, I will examine the Chain of Survival and systems of care, followed by evidence-based management across pre-arrest, intra-arrest, and post-arrest phases. After that, I need to consider special populations and circumstances, and finally, I should appraise evidence quality, identify knowledge gaps, and translate this into practical, quality-focused recommendations with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Cardiorespiratory arrest is the simultaneous cessation of cardiac output and effective ventilation, producing unresponsiveness, absent or abnormal breathing, and no palpable pulse; it is not synonymous with myocardial infarction, and survival remains low, with roughly 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the U.S. and approximately 9% survival to discharge, whereas in-hospital cardiac arrest survival is about 23% [^e30b9d5f] [^fe94b5c1] [^acfcac85].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without distinguishing primary cardiac from respiratory causes. Primary cardiac arrest often begins with a shockable rhythm where early compressions and defibrillation are decisive, whereas asphyxial or respiratory-precipitated arrests more often present as nonshockable rhythms and carry a higher burden of pre-arrest hypoxemia and secondary brain injury, which degrades outcomes even with ROSC [^6c5e5e4a] [^01d6477c].

> I need to check the Chain of Survival framework because it shapes both training and quality metrics. The modern Chain of Survival includes prevention and preparedness, recognition and activation, high-quality CPR, rapid defibrillation, advanced life support, post–cardiac arrest care, and recovery; systems of care that operationalize each link, measure performance, and feed data back into improvement cycles consistently outperform fragmented approaches [^16b92b3a] [^caf654ca] [^cf3b3050].

> Next, I should review pre-arrest prevention and early recognition, since stopping preventable in-hospital cardiac arrest is a high-yield target. Rapid response systems and early warning scores reduce IHCA incidence when implemented with dedicated teams, 24/7 availability, and a culture that encourages activation without reprisal; however, I should double-check the strength of evidence, as some reviews show little or no mortality benefit, underscoring that implementation quality and local context drive results [^deb67aae] [^ff22213a].

> Let me consider intra-arrest basics first, and I should confirm the C-A-B sequence and compression quality metrics. High-quality chest compressions at 100–120 per minute, adequate depth, full recoil, minimization of interruptions to achieve a chest compression fraction above 80%, and early defibrillation for shockable rhythms are the cornerstone; dispatcher-assisted CPR and telecommunicator guidance improve bystander performance and time to first compression, which correlates with survival [^a4a2fac3] [^98c42552].

> Wait, let me verify airway and ventilation strategy because this is often misunderstood. For adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, bag-mask ventilation is an acceptable initial approach and was noninferior to endotracheal intubation for favorable neurological outcomes in a large RCT; importantly, intubation attempts can interrupt compressions, so airway management should not delay high-quality CPR, and waveform capnography should be used to confirm and monitor advanced airways when placed [^44588e3c].

> I should confirm pharmacologic management and rhythm-specific algorithms. Epinephrine 1 mg every 3–5 minutes is standard in adult cardiac arrest, with consideration after initial defibrillation attempts in shockable rhythms; for asystole/PEA, epinephrine remains first-line while reversible causes are aggressively sought and treated, and atropine is reserved for bradycardia or suspected vagal-mediated presentations rather than routine use in asystole/PEA [^37eb0ef1] [^90868ae3] [^cdb12be9].

> But wait, what if the arrest is refractory despite optimized conventional CPR? In selected patients with refractory VF/VT, double sequential external defibrillation may be considered in systems with appropriate expertise, and extracorporeal CPR is a promising strategy in specialized centers, though evidence is limited and patient selection, timing, and post-ECPR care are critical determinants of benefit [^cdb12be9] [^93b24458].

> Next, I should review post–cardiac arrest care, because ROSC is only the beginning. Early stabilization targets include securing the airway with waveform capnography, titrating oxygen to SpO2 90–98% or PaO2 60–105 mmHg, adjusting ventilation to target PaCO2 35–45 mmHg, and maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors; early 12-lead ECG and consideration of emergency coronary angiography are essential, and targeted temperature management at 32–36°C for at least 24 hours is recommended for comatose survivors, with delayed neuroprognostication after 72 hours off sedatives when feasible [^0fcbd394] [^4d6201d7] [^5ebef45f].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances because the etiology and sequence differ. Most pediatric arrests follow respiratory failure or shock; therefore, airway and ventilation are prioritized early, and compressions are initiated if the heart rate remains below 60 with poor perfusion despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation; neonatal resuscitation emphasizes ventilation-first with corrective steps before compressions, reflecting the unique physiology and high prevalence of ventilatory causes in that population [^f949a8d3] [^6d1aab11] [^204fa6af].

> I will now examine special circumstances that modify standard algorithms. In trauma, prioritize hemorrhage control, airway, and decompression of tension pneumothorax; in drowning, use airway-opening and positive-pressure ventilation early; in pregnancy beyond 20 weeks, prepare for resuscitative delivery if ROSC is not achieved within about 4 minutes; in accidental hypothermia, confirm pulse for up to 1 minute before starting CPR and consider active rewarming; in COVID-19, early advanced airway with aerosol precautions is advised; and in LVAD patients, confirm arrest carefully and prioritize compressions and LVAD troubleshooting while planning for ECLS if needed [^48c26a1d] [^dbe6e0f5] [^2183a4f7] [^a817c52a] [^891ae950] [^96cbd1de].

> Let me reconsider systems-level quality improvement, because sustained gains hinge on measurement and feedback. High-performing programs track process metrics such as time to compression, chest compression fraction, time to defibrillation, and post-arrest care bundles, and they couple these with debriefing, simulation-based training, and registry participation to create learning health systems that iteratively improve outcomes [^cf3b3050] [^3790d5a1].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and explicitly flag uncertainties. Many post-arrest interventions have low to moderate certainty, including temperature targets, hemodynamic goals, and neuroprognostication tools; this variability argues for standardized protocols within institutions while allowing for shared decision-making and enrollment in trials when appropriate [^fe94b5c1] [^acfcac85].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical, actionable takeaways are clear. Build reliable systems for early recognition and RRS activation, train teams to deliver high-quality CPR with minimal interruptions, align airway strategies to context and rhythm, treat reversible causes aggressively, and implement comprehensive post-arrest pathways with early coronary evaluation, temperature control, hemodynamic optimization, and delayed neuroprognostication; embed measurement, debriefing, and quality loops to turn individual resuscitations into system-wide learning and improved survival with good neurological recovery [^caf654ca] [^0fcbd394] [^cf3b3050].

Cardiorespiratory arrest is the **simultaneous cessation of cardiac and respiratory function**, causing loss of consciousness, absent pulse, and apnea or agonal respirations [^e00e0d4e]. Immediate **high-quality CPR with early defibrillation** [^2bc83584] is the cornerstone of management, with compressions prioritized over ventilation in adults [^9d6e2bfb] [^01d6477c]. Post-arrest care focuses on **airway, oxygenation, hemodynamics, and neuroprotection** [^0fcbd394], including targeted temperature management and early coronary angiography when indicated [^4d6201d7]. Survival depends on rapid recognition, prompt bystander CPR, and integrated systems of care [^56b101db]; outcomes remain poor without early intervention, but can improve significantly with timely, guideline-concordant care [^99d89568].

---

## Pathophysiology

Cardiorespiratory arrest reflects **concurrent failure of cardiac output and ventilation**, producing global hypoxemia and hypercarbic acidosis that rapidly lead to irreversible organ injury if uncorrected [^7fda341a]. The most common causes include:

- **Cardiac causes**: ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, pulseless electrical activity, acute coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias [^e00e0d4e].
- **Respiratory causes**: severe hypoxemia, airway obstruction, respiratory failure, drowning, and asphyxia [^6c5e5e4a].
- **Non-cardiac causes**: trauma, sepsis, massive pulmonary embolism, electrolyte disturbances, and drug overdose [^6c5e5e4a].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Loss of consciousness**: sudden collapse or unresponsiveness [^e30b9d5f].
- **Absent pulse**: no palpable carotid or femoral pulse [^a1157e76].
- **Abnormal breathing**: apnea, agonal gasps, or irregular respirations [^e00e0d4e].
- **Cyanosis**: bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to hypoxemia [^notfound].

---

## Immediate management

### Basic life support (BLS)

- **Recognition**: assess responsiveness, breathing, and pulse within 10 seconds [^notfound].
- **Chest compressions**: initiate high-quality CPR at 100–120 compressions per minute, depth 2–2.4 inches, full recoil, and minimize interruptions [^a4a2fac3].
- **Airway and ventilation**: open airway, provide 2 rescue breaths after 30 compressions, or use compression-only CPR if unwilling or unable to provide breaths [^f8af433b].
- **Early defibrillation**: apply AED as soon as available and deliver shocks per rhythm analysis [^2bc83584].

---

### Advanced life support (ALS)

- **Airway management**: endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway device placement with waveform capnography [^0fcbd394].
- **Ventilation**: titrate oxygen to SpO2 90–98% or PaO2 60–105 mmHg; target PaCO2 35–45 mmHg [^0fcbd394].
- **Medications**: epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO every 3–5 minutes; antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, lidocaine) for refractory VF/VT; consider sodium bicarbonate for specific indications [^37eb0ef1] [^cdb12be9] [^3cfef69f].
- **Reversible causes**: identify and treat H's and T's (hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyper/hypokalemia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypothermia, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins, thrombosis) [^3cfef69f].

---

## Post-cardiac arrest care

Post-ROSC care is critical to improving outcomes and includes:

- **Airway and ventilation**: secure airway, titrate oxygen, and ventilate to normocapnia [^0fcbd394].
- **Hemodynamic support**: maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors [^0fcbd394].
- **Targeted temperature management (TTM)**: cool to 32–36°C for 24 hours in comatose patients [^5ebef45f].
- **Coronary angiography**: perform early in patients with suspected cardiac etiology [^0fcbd394].
- **Neurological prognostication**: delay until 72 hours after rewarming, off sedatives, using multimodal assessment [^4d6201d7].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Survival and neurological outcomes vary by setting and intervention. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival to discharge is approximately 9–10% [^fe94b5c1], whereas in-hospital cardiac arrest survival is about 23% [^acfcac85]. Early bystander CPR and rapid defibrillation markedly improve survival and neurological recovery [^99d89568].

---

## Prevention and public health initiatives

Prevention focuses on **public CPR training**, widespread AED deployment, and rapid response systems in hospitals [^56b101db]. Addressing risk factors such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias through education, screening, and treatment is essential [^notfound].

---

Cardiorespiratory arrest is a **medical emergency** requiring immediate, coordinated care. Early recognition, high-quality CPR, rapid defibrillation, and structured post-arrest management are essential to improve survival and neurological outcomes [^16b92b3a].

### Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting as cardiorespiratory arrest… [^53e7da44]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Three cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured developmental aneurysm are reported. Two patients presented with cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated, but the diagnosis of SAH was delayed and this most likely influenced poor final outcome. The third patient presented with irreversible respiratory arrest. The possible mechanisms responsible for SAH-triggered cardiac arrhythmia and/or respiratory arrest are discussed. Absence of previous cardiac history, persistent headache, focal neurologic findings should warn the clinician of the possibility of SAH and warrant further neurologic investigation.

### Postarrest interventions that save lives [^594baea1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest require complex management. An organized approach to early postarrest care can improve patient outcomes. Priorities include completing a focused diagnostic work-up to identify and reverse the inciting cause of arrest, stabilizing cardiorespiratory instability to prevent rearrest, minimizing secondary brain injury, evaluating the risk and benefits of transfer to a specialty care center, and avoiding early neurologic prognostication.

### Part 4: systems of care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^caf654ca]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest systems of care (SOC) are presented as a comprehensive framework of personnel, resources, and policies and procedures designed to provide a coordinated, efficient, and highly effective response, with the primary goal to resuscitate patients back to the function and quality of life that they enjoyed before the cardiac arrest. Important secondary goals include effective team function, optimizing the long-term survivor experience for the patient and those involved in the resuscitation, and improving the SOC through ongoing quality management and research. The objective of a cardiac arrest SOC is to quickly, efficiently, and effectively perform each step in the Chain of Survival, and the SOC needed to execute the early links of the Chain of Survival differs between in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and OHCA, but assuming ROSC, these converge within the intensive care unit and continue through hospitalization and following discharge. These SOC guidelines are broadly applicable to persons of all ages, though are not geared toward neonatal resuscitation. Patient outcomes ultimately depend on some factors beyond the scope of this Part, such as the patient's comorbidities, yet a well-functioning cardiac arrest SOC can produce the best outcome achievable for any given patient by optimizing the execution of each link in the Chain of Survival. The Chain of Survival is intended to be applied to both adult and pediatric in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, though the details vary in each application, and the recommendations in this Part follow the links of the Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and preparedness, which precede the cardiac arrest event.

### Ten steps toward improving in-hospital cardiac arrest quality of care and outcomes [^104fae1d]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The Ten Steps Toward Improving In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Quality of Care and Outcomes provides a framework for all stakeholders to analyze their strengths and weaknesses in their response to all patients who sustain IHCA, regardless of age. They highlight critical areas in resuscitation care and suggest approaches to addressing components of these areas that will have the largest potential impact on lowering IHCA incidence and improving survival. These steps were identified as part of a comprehensive consensus process with interdisciplinary experts from diverse backgrounds and around the world. Yet it is important to remember that IHCA remains an under-studied medical condition with significant knowledge gaps, and future research will be needed to improve quality of resuscitation care and outcomes after IHCA even further. In conclusion, the Ten Steps documented here reflect current knowledge of best practices within resuscitation systems and serve as a foundation for improving IHCA quality of care and outcomes across different settings.

Step 6: Develop and Deploy an Effective Resuscitation Response System

Make available a hospital-wide resuscitation response system that is easily and rapidly activated. Ensure a high-quality resuscitation team that includes preassigned, experienced, and interdisciplinary health care professionals.

Summary

Even a minute of delay can significantly worsen a cardiac arrest victim's likelihood of survival. Prompt detection of cardiac arrest and delivery of basic life support including high-quality CPR, defibrillation, and timely treatment by initial responders are critical. Immediate activation and response from a multidisciplinary resuscitation team that can initiate advanced life support is essential. High-performing systems ensure that resuscitation teams are supported by administrative leadership.

Over the last several decades, there has been substantial emphasis on training health care staff on resuscitation protocols. Recent studies have highlighted strategies for implementing resuscitation teams at hospitals that consistently achieve high IHCA survival. These attributes include dedicated or designated resuscitation teams that are preassigned, multidisciplinary team members with clear roles and responsibilities, and effective communication and leadership during IHCA. Moreover, a strong emphasis on training, mentoring, and empowerment of frontline health care professionals like nurses was also present in these studies.

Strategies for Implementation

We propose that hospitals implement a resuscitation team that can be rapidly deployed to a patient in cardiac arrest. Emergency plans to bring equipment such as a defibrillator, emergency drugs, and airway to the bedside are vital. All initial responders should be trained to start CPR.

To address the complex and myriad needs of patients with IHCA, the resuscitation team should ideally include medical staff and nurses with other health professionals as appropriate. Resuscitation teams are more effective when members are preassigned and available to respond immediately. At some institutions, hospital staff who respond to cardiac arrest and other hospital emergencies have limited-to-no other responsibilities. While such a model may not be universally applicable, it is important that the team leader and key roles such as who will perform chest compressions, provide defibrillation, and manage the airway are delineated before, or early during a cardiac arrest, and matched to individual skills. Strong effective leadership, closed-loop communication, and mutual respect are hallmarks of highly effective resuscitation teams. It is also vital that resuscitation teams are well supported with education and training efforts that go beyond traditional training on cardiac arrest algorithms.

### Cardiovascular implanted electronic devices in people towards the end of life, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after death: guidance from the resuscitation council (UK), British cardiovascular society and national council for palliative care [^88678760]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The Resuscitation Council (UK), the British Cardiovascular Society (including the British Heart Rhythm Society and the British Society for Heart Failure) and the National Council for Palliative Care recognise the importance of providing clear and consistent guidance on management of cardiovascular implanted electronic devices (CIEDs) towards the end of life, during cardiorespiratory arrest and after death. This document has been developed to provide guidance for the full range of healthcare professionals who may encounter people with CIEDs in the situations described and for healthcare managers and commissioners. The authors recognise that some patients and people close to patients may also wish to refer to this document. It is intended as an initial step to help to ensure that people who have CIEDs, or are considering implantation of one, receive explanation of and understand the practical implications and decisions that this entails; to promote a good standard of care and service provision for people in the UK with CIEDs in the circumstances described; to offer relevant ethical and legal guidance on this topic; to offer guidance on the delivery of services in relation to deactivation of CIEDs where appropriate; to offer guidance on whether any special measures are needed when a person with a CIED receives cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and to offer guidance on the actions needed when a person with a CIED dies.

### Airway management of the cardiac arrest victim [^b729397a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Appropriate airway management is critical to successful cardiac arrest resuscitation. However, the timing and method of airway management during cardiac arrest have traditionally been guided by expert and consensus opinion informed by observational data. In the last 5 years, recent studies, including several randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have provided additional clarity to help guide airway management. This article will review both current data and guidelines for airway management in cardiac arrest, a stepwise approach to airway management, the utility of various airway adjuncts, and best practices for oxygenation and ventilation in the peri-arrest period.

### Ten steps toward improving in-hospital cardiac arrest quality of care and outcomes [^ce132fef]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STEPS

Our collective commitment to enhancing IHCA care has been the driving force behind this work, underscoring the essential role of collaboration in addressing complex health challenges. Our intent is not to impose a one-size-fits-all approach; rather, we recognize that local context, considering unique needs, geographic concerns, and available resources, will guide the prioritization and application of the Ten Steps. In other words, the steps are not meant to represent a natural order or a hierarchical sequence for their introduction into a system. Rather, each institution or health system should use these steps to identify the areas of the greatest need in determining which steps they would prioritize to achieve the highest impact on their IHCA care. The goal is to assist hospitals and health systems to establish, support, reinforce, evaluate, and improve their resuscitation systems for IHCA, with the aim of enhancing survival outcomes, ensuring quality care, and fostering a continuous cycle of improvement (Figure).

Our goal here is to provide practical guidance to improve IHCA quality of care and outcomes. To implement the Ten Steps in this document effectively, each institution should first conduct a thorough needs assessment of its existing infrastructure, including its teams, protocols, and resources, as well as its outcomes related to IHCA. Based on this appraisal, the institution can then use the suggested steps to identify gaps, set priorities, and create an action plan tailored to its context and resources. Such approaches may involve creating a multidisciplinary team committed to the improvement process, ensuring that the communication lines are open and developing a shared understanding of the objectives.

We cannot underscore enough the critical role of champions, resources, and administrative support in implementing these steps — themes that came up frequently during our discussions. Achieving excellence in IHCA care is not simply about applying new techniques or protocols; it involves fostering a culture that values continuous improvement, patient-centered care, and interdisciplinary teamwork. The need for adequate resources, coupled with a strong commitment from the administration, is integral to nurturing such a culture and ensuring sustained improvement. Our guidance in the Ten Steps places a significant emphasis on affordability, availability, and sustainability of IHCA care. Addressing these aspects requires expanding our scope to cover essential areas such as training, education, and postresuscitation care (including beyond hospital discharge). This includes developing innovative, cost-effective solutions and strengthening the human resources through capacity building and continuous training, particularly in low-resource settings.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^cdb12be9]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

In these 2025 Advanced Life Support Guidelines, the American Heart Association provides comprehensive recommendations for the resuscitation and management of adults experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies. Based on structured evidence reviews and the latest clinical research, these guidelines offer evidence-based strategies to optimize survival and patient outcomes. The 2025 guidelines provide guidance for the treatment of cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity, as well as peri-arrest conditions such as atrial fibrillation and flutter with rapid ventricular response. Recommendations are made for defibrillation, electrical cardioversion, advanced airway management, drug therapies, and intravenous access. Additionally, guidelines are provided for the use of double sequential defibrillation, head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound in the advanced life support setting. Termination of resuscitation rules have been refined to guide decision-making based on the emergency medical services professional's scope of practice. Finally, these guidelines also underscore the importance of identifying causative versus secondary arrhythmias to inform the appropriate timing of therapeutic strategies.

### Airway and ventilation management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after successful resuscitation [^44323bf9]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Steps for airway and ventilation management during CPR and after ROSC

During CPR, airway interventions range from compression-only CPR with or without airway opening, mouth-to-mouth ventilation, mouth-to-mask ventilation, bag-mask ventilation (with or without an oropharyngeal airway) or advanced airways (supraglottic airways (SGAs) and tracheal intubation using direct or video laryngoscopy) (Fig. 1). In a feasibility study to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of OHCA, patients in the 'usual' airway management group were observed to have both basic and advanced airway interventions which changed according to the skills of the rescuer present and the time-point during resuscitation.

Fig. 1
Stepwise approach to airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation

After ROSC for both IHCA and OHCA, most patients have a post-cardiac arrest syndrome, are comatose with impaired airway reflexes and ventilation and/or have an indication for tracheal intubation based on their underlying condition. Patients who remain conscious and do not require airway interventions tend to have an initial shockable rhythm, are treated early with defibrillation and have better outcomes. Tracheal intubation enables controlled ventilation to facilitate onwards transportation to the emergency department after OHCA, cardiac catheterisation laboratory or intensive care unit. Drug-assisted intubation by critical care teams for both IHCA and OHCA patients with ROSC using a protocol-based approach (e.g. with ketamine or midazolam, fentanyl and rocuronium) can be safe and effective.

### Pediatric advanced life support… [^f949a8d3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

CARDIOPULMONARY arrest in infants and children is rarely a sudden event. Instead, it is often the end result of a progressive deterioration in respiratory and circulatory function. Both shock and respiratory failure are usually preceded by a compensated state, but children can rapidly deteriorate from such states. Therefore, early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure must be promptly detected and treated so that cardiorespiratory arrest is prevented. Pediatric advanced life support refers to the assessment and support of pulmonary and circulatory function. Pediatric ALS is designed to prevent or detect cardiopulmonary dysfunction and arrest in the critically ill or injured child.

The components of pediatric ALS are similar in many respects to the components of adult advanced cardiac life support and include the following: basic life support, the use of adjunctive equipment and special techniques for establishing and maintaining effective ventilation and perfusion, electrocardiographic. Pediatric Advanced Life Support. JAMA. 1992; 268: 2262–2275.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^0fcbd394]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Adult post–cardiac arrest care — initial stabilization after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) includes airway management with assessment and possible placement or exchange of an advanced airway device and confirmation using waveform capnography or capnometry; managing oxygenation and ventilation by Maintain 100% FiO2, until SpO2 (or PaO2) can be measured reliably, then titrating FiO2 for SpO2 90%–98% (or PaO2, 60–105 mm Hg) and adjusting minute ventilation to target PCO2, 35–45 mm Hg; managing hemodynamics with goal MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg; early diagnostic testing to obtain 12-lead ECG with consideration of CT and ultrasound; treating arrest etiologies and complications with consideration of emergency coronary angiography and/or mechanical circulatory support; and assessing the patient off sedation and neuromuscular blockade, if able.

### Cardiorespiratory arrest in children (out of hospital) [^2bda581c]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiorespiratory arrest outside hospital occurs in approximately 1/10,000 children a year in resource-rich countries, with two-thirds of arrests occurring in children under 18 months of age. Approximately 45% of cases have undetermined causes, including sudden infant death syndrome. Of the rest, 20% are caused by trauma, 10% by chronic disease, and 6% by pneumonia.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for non-submersion out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway management and ventilation (bag-mask ventilation and intubation), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, direct-current cardiac shock, hypothermia, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, standard dose of intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine), and training parents to perform resuscitation.

Step 4: Establish Patient and Family Goals of Treatment Early and Reassess Often

Proactively and collaboratively engage patients and their families in dialogue regarding their preferences for resuscitation in the context of their values, comorbidities, frailty, and family needs. Recognize that there are patients for whom resuscitation is unwanted or unlikely to result in an outcome that is acceptable to the patient. Ideally, goals of treatment conversations would start in the community and be updated on admission and after any change in clinical condition.

Summary

Goals of treatment discussions play a crucial role in patient care, especially when addressing emergency treatment decisions like resuscitation. Ideally, these discussions should occur before hospital admission and involve the patient and their primary care practitioner. These should consider realistic goals for treatment alongside patients' personal values and preferences and any advanced directives. Upon admission to the hospital, it is essential to revisit and establish clear goals of treatment (eg, relevant options, limited time trials), as well as specifically addressing emergency treatments such as CPR, as some patients may not want to be resuscitated.

During the hospital stay, it is necessary to reassess goals of treatment as the patient's illness or injury evolves, following a change in patient preferences or their risk of cardiac arrest, or when transferring to a different care setting. This includes continuously evaluating the effectiveness of ongoing therapies and considering the option of withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Overall, fostering open and informed discussions about treatment goals between patients, their families, and health care professionals is vital to delivering patient-centered care and ensuring that medical decisions are in line with the patient's preferences and values.

Strategies for Implementation

Structured communication tools improve the quality of communication, patient involvement, and documentation of patient wishes and treatment plans. – Staff need to be supported with training in the use of such tools, and recommendations should be recorded to ensure that these decisions are accessible and transferrable within and between care settings. If organ donation is appropriate, ensure trained staff handle the interface with the patient's family and the treatment team is made aware.

Culturally sensitive materials should be developed and implemented to acknowledge that approaches to goals of treatment will vary across communities. Collaborative decision-making models that involve families, community leaders, and health care professionals can be used to ensure that cultural values and preferences are respected while honoring the individual's wishes (eg, family presence during resuscitation).

### Cardiorespiratory arrest in children (out of hospital) [^850c1977]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiorespiratory arrest outside hospital occurs in approximately 1/10,000 children a year in resource-rich countries, with two thirds of arrests occurring in children under 18 months of age. Approximately 40% of cases have undetermined causes, including sudden infant death syndrome. Of the rest, 20% are caused by trauma, 10% by chronic disease, and 6% by pneumonia.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for non-submersion out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway management and ventilation (bag-mask ventilation and intubation), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, direct-current cardiac shock, hypothermia, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, standard dose of intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine), and training parents to perform resuscitation.

### Difficult airway consultation service for children: steps to implement and preliminary results [^24b24826]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Failed airway management remains one of the most common causes of cardiopulmonary arrest in the pediatric population. Practice guidelines addressing the difficult airway (DAW) in adults provide anesthesiologists a framework for managing the airway during the perioperative period; however, similar consensus guidelines are lacking in the pediatric population. Many of the adverse events associated with difficult pediatric airway management occur outside the perioperative setting and often result in worse outcomes. The lower frequency of DAW management required in children, lesser awareness of pediatric health care professionals about DAW management, and the need for guiding principles led us to develop a DAW consultative service. This report outlines the steps to establish the Difficult Airway Service (DAS) and the initial experiences with this new consultation service.

Methods

The mission of the DAS is to identify children with known or anticipated DAWs, communicate the diagnosis and collaborate with referring medical and surgical services, and to manage children in those settings that airway management might be required in the context of the patient's ongoing medical care.

Results

The initial 3-month experience confirmed that a majority of pediatric DAW events are associated with congenital or acquired abnormalities. Through appropriate consultation and leadership, the DAS was able to physically and electronically identify pediatric patients with a DAW and provide management. Hospital-wide participation was instrumental in the success and exponential growth of DAS: planned preoperative tracheostomy in complicated posterior spinal fusion candidates, participation in EXIT procedures, standardization of airway carts, and implementation of education forums.

Conclusion

In developing the DAS, our goal was to provide a more comprehensive approach to caring for a child with a DAW that included their entire hospital stay and follow-up care. We believe this approach has improved health care professional awareness as well as the safe management of routine and difficult pediatric airway. Additional studies are needed to determine whether measurable changes in morbidity and mortality are observed over time.

### The continuum of critical care [^ff22213a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Importantly, identification of deterioration alone is of course not sufficient to improve outcomes. A system must be in place to determine how to manage the patient in question. Generally, escalating protocols are used, determined by the degree of deterioration detected and whether the patient's condition is worsening or getting better. Such systems have to be adapted to the local hospital organization and available facilities. Often an increase in frequency of monitoring and notification of a more senior member of staff are the first steps, followed eventually by a call to some form of rapid response system (RRS) that can attend, assess, and if necessary start treatment of patients on the general hospital ward who have early signs of deterioration in order to prevent further worsening. Transfer to the ICU can then be arranged if necessary. This type of call for a deteriorating patient needs to be differentiated from "code blue" or "crash" calls (for example for cardiac arrests) where specific teams will run to assist with resuscitation. Members of the RRS called to a deteriorating patient outside the ICU will arrive rapidly but without the emergency associated with a code blue call. In some hospitals, the two teams will include the same personnel, but the speed and type of response will be different. Most RRS include a doctor and a physiotherapist (for respiratory distress) or an experienced nurse, or some combination of these, which is why the term RRS is better than medical emergency team, which implies only doctors are included. In our institution, the "code blue team" includes a doctor and one or two nurses, the RRS includes one doctor, and we have a separate phone number for a physiotherapist (all available 24/7). We also have a shock room to which such patients can be admitted for initial resuscitation before transfer to the ICU. The four-bed room is fully equipped for all emergencies and staffed 24 h. Although difficult to study given the nature of the intervention, several reports have suggested that RRS are associated with reduced incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest, reduced ICU admissions, and improved patient outcomes. When staffed by members of the ICU team, they also help provide continuity of care from the general ward to the ICU.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^fe94b5c1]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects > 600,000 people in the United States annually, with a worldwide annual incidence of 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is important and influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although there has been improvement in outcomes of patients with sudden CA, overall survival continues to be low, and the quality of life of survivors is affected. The overall survival to hospital discharge in 2020 in adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9% and in those with in-hospital CA was 23%. Research and advancement of care have focused on the chain of survival measures to improve CA resuscitation: recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with emphasis on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. Focus has been on early response with the goal of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as soon as possible. Achieving ROSC is just the start of comprehensive, multisystem care for survivors of CA. On achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, a marker of significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence for the benefit of many interventions after ROSC is limited.

Current guidelines provide few strong recommendations about post-CA care because of the scope of available literature and limited certainty of evidence. The guidelines writing processes consist of a structured framework to transform evidence into a clinical decision; thus, many crucial management questions relevant to the hours and days after CA cannot be answered currently through these processes. The paucity of evidence and guideline recommendations results in wide variations in clinical practice. This variability could be detrimental to patients and presents an opportunity to develop clinical guidance that will standardize and facilitate care for these patients. We sought to bring together a diverse group with expertise in post-CA care to identify current knowledge gaps and to provide guidance on care in topics for which research and existing guidelines were not able to provide high certainty of evidence.

Step 5: Stop Preventable IHCA

Have systems (eg, early warning systems) and teams (eg, medical/rapid response teams) in place to enable early prediction, identification, and response to deteriorating patients. Provide effective communication to ensure a clear plan and safe transition of care.

Summary

Preventing IHCA will reduce hospital morbidity and mortality. While not all IHCAs are predictable or avoidable, having an approach to stopping preventable IHCA is a key step toward saving lives. Stopping preventable IHCA requires the establishment of afferent alert and efferent rapid response systems that are bolstered by robust implementation, governance, and continuous quality improvement. Reliable methods to communicate treatment plans and patient values or preferences among clinical teams are critical in stopping preventable IHCA and making appropriate resuscitation interventions (including not starting a resuscitation).

Published rates of preventable IHCA range from 9% to 78% in hospital wards and from 10% to 41% in intensive care units. – Opportunities for addressing preventable IHCA should be prioritized by local hospital cardiac arrest and quality improvement committees. The ILCOR Consensus on Science With Treatment Recommendations suggests that hospitals consider the introduction of a rapid response system to support deteriorating patients and reduce the incidence of IHCA. However, a recent Cochrane review reported that early warning scoring and rapid response systems provide little or no benefit. Despite limited evidence that early warning scoring and rapid response systems improve outcomes, they are a global patient safety mainstay and recommended by several key organizations.

Strategies for Implementation

Implementation of rapid response systems is complex, and data on best practices are limited.

Evidence suggests that high-performing rapid response systems are staffed by a multidisciplinary team of dedicated personnel without competing responsibilities, who work collaboratively with bedside teams, and foster a culture of safety that enables system activation without concern for reprisal. Rapid response systems should work 24/7, which presents instances where shared decision-making might be difficult. In such circumstances, transfer of patients to a high level of care may provide time for involvement of other teams in decisions on resuscitation. Rapid response systems might also consider palliative and end-of-life care during a response. –

Because escalation of care to prevent IHCA is often driven by vital sign abnormalities or clinician concern, regular measurement and interpretation of vital signs is critical to IHCA prevention. Severity-of-illness scoring systems can be used for assessment and detection of deterioration, thus prompting a timely clinical response. There is increasing interest in integrating machine learning–based and artificial intelligence–powered systems to enable early detection of the deteriorating patient.

### Cardiac arrest in special populations [^5b0381e4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

In certain cardiac arrest situations, modifications to current cardiac resuscitation algorithms may improve patient outcome. These situations are often rare, but when they occur they house the potential for severe time and resource use, and in some cases specialized skill sets. The decision to apply these modifications to standard care for the cardiac arrest patient may be obvious in some cases or may be applied due to suspicion from the presenting medical history, history of present illness, or physical examination. However, with rare exception, general care of any cardiac arrest patient should include continuous high-quality chest compressions and appropriate airway and ventillatory management.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^4d6201d7]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest is common and deadly, affecting up to 700000 people in the United States annually. Advanced cardiac life support measures are commonly employed to improve outcomes. This 2025 guideline on adult post-cardiac arrest care from the American Heart Association summarizes the most recent published evidence for and recommendations on several important areas of post-cardiac arrest management. Based on structured evidence reviews, guidelines are provided for initial blood pressure, oxygen, ventilation, and glucose goals. Evidence evaluating the routine use of antibiotics after return of spontaneous circulation is reviewed. The update also reviews diagnostic testing modalities, temperature control goals and duration, and the use of percutaneous coronary intervention and mechanical circulatory support in the patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest. New data regarding the detection and management of seizures have been incorporated, along with updates regarding the timing and modalities used in neuroprognostication. These guidelines now differentiate prognostication for favorable versus unfavorable outcome. New sections on the utility of advanced neuromonitoring, along with definitions and treatment options for myoclonus, are included to guide the clinician. Expanded recommendations regarding how to optimize survivorship for patients, caregivers, and rescuers are reviewed. Finally, the potential role of organ donation in the patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest is reviewed.

### Cardiorespiratory arrest in children (out of hospital) [^31105c1e]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiorespiratory arrest outside hospital occurs in approximately 1/10,000 children per year in resource-rich countries, with two-thirds of arrests occurring in children under 18 months of age. Approximately 45% of cases have undetermined causes, including sudden infant death syndrome. Of the rest, 20% are caused by trauma, 10% by chronic disease, and 6% by pneumonia.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for non-submersion out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 192 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 81 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 68 studies and the further review of 13 full publications. Of the 13 full articles evaluated, three systematic reviews were added at this update. We have also added eight studies to the Comment section. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for nine interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of airway management and ventilation (bag-mask ventilation and intubation), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, direct-current cardiac shock, high dose and standard dose intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine), intravenous sodium bicarbonate, intubation versus bag-mask ventilation, targeted temperature management, and training parents to perform resuscitation.

### Necessity of immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in trauma emergency [^8c8ff610]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the medical practice, the different scenarios in which cardiorespiratory resuscitation (CPR) may be applied must be taken into account. CPR is crucial in patients that arrive in emergency rooms or suffer a cardiac arrest in public places or in their homes. It is also critical in hospitalized patients with potentially reversible diseases, who suffer cardiac arrest as an unexpected event during their evolution.

The latest guidelines for CPR and emergency cardiovascular care published by the American Heart Association include substantial changes to the algorithms for basic life support and advanced cardiovascular life support.

The most critical emergency situation seen in cardiac surgical units is the need for chest reopening. While senior nurses often manage cardiac arrest they currently are not trained to open chests, which can be a life-saving action if performed efficiently. The ability to respond quickly and effectively to a cardiac arrest situation rests on nurses being competent in the emergency life-saving procedure of CPR. The study findings present strong evidence to support the critical role of CPR training in ensuring that nursing student's progress to competent and confident responders in the event of a cardiac related emergency.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the types of injuries and the survival of patients who require immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in trauma emergencies.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^04252e50]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Resuscitation in traumatic cardiac arrest — assessment emphasizes a balance of rapid, focused evaluation followed by prompt treatment of reversible life threats, including management of massive hemorrhage, airway management, decompression of tension pneumothorax, and resuscitation. Assessment steps include assessing for signs of life, including pulses, respiratory effort, and evaluation of other signs of life, and assessing for evidence of massive hemorrhage, including evidence of massive external hemorrhage.

### Airway and ventilation management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after successful resuscitation [^01d6477c]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Do we need an airway, oxygenation and ventilation during CPR?

Current guidelines recommend that, after a primary cardiac arrest, restoring a circulation with chest compressions and, if appropriate, attempted defibrillation to restart the heart take priority over airway and ventilation interventions. The premise is that there is an adequate oxygen reservoir at the time of cardiac arrest and further oxygen is only required after about 4 minutes. When cardiac arrest follows airway and/or breathing problems (asphyxial cardiac arrest), earlier interventions to restore adequate oxygenation to the vital organs may be preferable.

Current guidelines for CPR emphasise chest compressions for all cardiac arrests because:
Chest compressions are easy to learn and do for most rescuers and do not require special equipment. Studies show that lay rescuer compression-only CPR is better than no CPR.
Sudden cardiac arrest, with an initial shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/pVT]) has good outcomes with early CPR and early defibrillation.
Survival after a non-cardiac cause of cardiac arrest, such as asphyxial cardiac arrest and which more commonly lead to an initial non-shockable cardiac arrest rhythm (pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole), is relatively poor even if there is ROSC. Patients often have severe brain injury associated with hypoxaemia and low blood flow preceding cardiac arrest, a period of no or low flow during CPR and reperfusion injury following ROSC.
As VF/pVT has a better response to treatment, CPR interventions prioritise treatment for VF/pVT at the expense of those that may be helpful for PEA or asystole.

### Temperature management after cardiac arrest: an advisory statement by the advanced life support task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the council on cardiopulmonary, critical care, perioperative and resuscitation [^5ebef45f]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, mild induced hypothermia (32 °C-34 °C) has been standard of care for patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, and this has been extrapolated to survivors of cardiac arrest with initially nonshockable rhythms and to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two randomized trials published in 2002 reported a survival and neurological benefit with mild induced hypothermia. One recent randomized trial reported similar outcomes in patients treated with targeted temperature management at either 33 °C or 36 °C. In response to these new data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Advanced Life Support Task Force performed a systematic review to evaluate 3 key questions: (1) Should mild induced hypothermia (or some form of targeted temperature management) be used in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients? (2) If used, what is the ideal timing of the intervention? (3) If used, what is the ideal duration of the intervention? The task force used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess and summarize the evidence and to provide a consensus on science statement and treatment recommendations. The task force recommends targeted temperature management for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm at a constant temperature between 32 °C and 36 °C for at least 24 hours. Similar suggestions are made for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. The task force recommends against prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluid. Additional and specific recommendations are provided in the document.

### Achieving housestaff competence in emergency airway management using scenario based simulation training: comparison of attending vs housestaff trainers [^722b21d8]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate a teaching protocol comparing a critical care attending to a housestaff team in training medical interns in initial airway management skills using a computer-controlled patient simulator (CPS) and scenario-based simulation training (SST).

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded trial.

Setting

Internal medicine residency training program in an urban teaching hospital.

Participants

Forty-nine starting internal medicine interns in July 2003, all of whom had been certified in advanced cardiac life support in June 2003.

Interventions

All interns were tested and scored with a CPS while responding to a standardized respiratory arrest scenario. Random allocation to either training by a single experienced teaching attending or by a housestaff team occurred immediately following testing. All interns were retested using the same scenario 6 weeks following the initial training, and their clinical performance of airway management was scored during actual patient events throughout the year.

Measurements

Initial airway management was divided into specific scorable steps. For each intern, individual step scores and total scores were recorded before and after training. For 10 consecutive months following training, intern airway management scores were recorded for actual patient airway events.

Results

All starting medical interns demonstrated poor initial airway management skills. SST was effective in improving these skills, both on retesting with the patient simulator and in actual patient situations. Interns trained by a housestaff team performed as well as interns trained by the attending.

Conclusions

SST is effective in training medical interns, and the results are equivalent whether the training is provided by an experienced teaching attending or by a housestaff training team.

### COVID-19 cardiac arrest management: a review for emergency clinicians [^891ae950]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A great deal of literature has recently discussed the evaluation and management of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patient in the emergency department (ED) setting, but there remains a dearth of literature providing guidance on cardiac arrest management in this population.

Objective

This narrative review outlines the underlying pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to cardiac arrest management in the ED based on the current literature as well as extrapolations from experience with other pathogens.

Discussion

Patients with COVID-19 may experience cardiovascular manifestations that place them at risk for acute myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The mortality for these critically ill patients is high and increases with age and comorbidities. While providing resuscitative interventions and performing procedures on these patients, healthcare providers must adhere to strict infection control measures and prioritize their own safety through the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. A novel approach must be implemented in combination with national guidelines. The changes in these guidelines emphasize early placement of an advanced airway to limit nosocomial viral transmission and encourage healthcare providers to determine the effectiveness of their efforts prior to placing staff at risk for exposure.

Conclusions

While treatment priorities and goals are identical to pre-pandemic approaches, the management of COVID-19 patients in cardiac arrest has distinct differences from cardiac arrest patients without COVID-19. We provide a review of the current literature on the changes in cardiac arrest management as well as details outlining team composition.

### Management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^7fda341a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent advances in resuscitation science have revolutionized care of the cardiac arrest patient. Dramatic departures from time-honored advanced cardiac life support therapies, such as cardiocerebral resuscitation and bundled post-arrest care, have given rise to a new paradigm of resuscitation practices, which has boosted the rate of neurologically intact survival.

Objectives

This article reviews the pathophysiology of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the collective pathophysiology after return of spontaneous circulation, and presents management pearls specifically for the emergency physician. This growing area of scientific inquiry must be managed appropriately to sustain improved outcomes.

Discussion

The emergency physician must understand this pathophysiology, manage resuscitated patients according to the latest evidence, and coordinate with appropriate inpatient resources.

Conclusion

The new approach to cardiac arrest care is predicated on a chain of survival that spans the spectrum of care from the prehospital arena through the emergency, intensive, and inpatient settings. The emergency physician is a crucial link in this chain.

Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights

The complete evidence-to-decision framework can be found on the ILCOR website, and the evidence-to-decision table is provided in Appendix A.

In making this weak recommendation, we note that this patient population (ie, cardiac arrest for which conventional CPR is failing) has a very high mortality rate. Therefore, the potential for benefit and value of this intervention remains despite the overall low certainty in the evidence.
The published randomized trials have included highly selected patients for ECPR. The trial by Yannopoulos et alenrolled patients with OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm refractory to at least 3 shocks and randomized patients on hospital arrival. The trials by Hsu et aland Belohlavek et alenrolled patients with OHCA with any initial rhythm and randomized patients in the prehospital setting. In all 3 trials, the intervention was a treatment strategy that included ECPR. The percentages of patients in the intervention group who received ECPR were 80%, 42%, and 66% in the Yannopoulos et al, Hsu et al, and Belohlavek et al trials, respectively. The ECPR strategy in the trials by Yannopoulos et al and Belohlavek et al included immediate access to a catheterization laboratory. Guidelines for clinical practice should ideally apply to populations similar to those enrolled in the trials to date, although randomized trials have not been performed to define the optimal population. For this reason, the findings of individual trials should be interpreted cautiously in the context of the trial setting and population.
We acknowledge that ECPR is a complex intervention that requires considerable resources and training that are not universally available but also acknowledge the value of an intervention that may be successful in individuals for whom usual CPR techniques have failed.

### Cardiac arrest resuscitation [^d2449b7e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a dynamic disease that tests the multitasking and leadership abilities of emergency physicians. Providers must simultaneously manage the logistics of resuscitation while searching for the cause of cardiac arrest. The astute clinician will also realize that he or she is orchestrating only one portion of a larger series of events, each of which directly affects patient outcomes. Resuscitation science is rapidly evolving, and emergency providers must be familiar with the latest evidence and controversies surrounding resuscitative techniques. This article reviews evidence, discusses controversies, and offers strategies to provide quality cardiac arrest resuscitation.

Key points
- Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating.
- Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.
- If you believe someone is having a cardiac arrest, call 9-1-1 right away, look for an automated external defibrillator, and give CPR until medical professionals arrive. What it is More than 356, 000 people have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States every year, Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. Blood stops flowing to the rest of the body. People who survive cardiac arrest can have:

- Brain injury.
- Injury to internal organs.
- Psychological distress, like anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack, myocarditis, or pericarditis.

Signs and symptoms A person may be in cardiac arrest if they:

- Collapse suddenly and lose consciousness.
- Are not breathing or are gasping for air.
- Don't respond to shouting or shaking.
- Don't have a pulse. If you believe someone is having a cardiac arrest, call 9-1-1 right away, look for an automated external defibrillator, and give CPR until medical professionals arrive. At-risk populations People at highest risk for cardiac arrest are older adults and men. Black men and women are more likely to die from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest than White men and women. Causes Cardiac arrest has several causes, including:

- Cardiomyopathy, which happens when the heart muscle becomes enlarged or stiff, leading to abnormal contractions.
- Coronary artery disease, which restricts the flow of blood to the heart.
- Heart valve disease occurs when a valve in the heart is damaged or diseased.
- An arrhythmia, which is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. Although rare, a forceful blow to the chest, as from a hard ball or steering wheel, can also cause cardiac arrest. This condition is called commotio cordis.

### Postcardiac arrest management [^646a03d2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest afflicts more than 300,000 persons annually in North America alone. Advances in systematic, regimented postresuscitation care have lowered mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in select cohorts of patients over the last decade. Postcardiac arrest care now comprises its own link in the chain of survival. For most patients, high-quality postcardiac arrest care begins in the Emergency Department. This article reviews the evidence and offers treatment strategies for the key components of postcardiac arrest care.

### Effect of bag-mask ventilation vs endotracheal intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation on neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest: a randomized clinical trial [^8cfcd5b4]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is a less complex technique than endotracheal intubation (ETI) for airway management during the advanced cardiac life support phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation of patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest. It has been reported as superior in terms of survival.

Objectives

To assess noninferiority of BMV vs ETI for advanced airway management with regard to survival with favorable neurological function at day 28.

Design, Settings, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing BMV with ETI in 2043 patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in France and Belgium. Enrollment occurred from March 9, 2015, to January 2, 2017, and follow-up ended January 26, 2017.

Intervention

Participants were randomized to initial airway management with BMV (n = 1020) or ETI (n = 1023).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was favorable neurological outcome at 28 days defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2. A noninferiority margin of 1% was chosen. Secondary end points included rate of survival to hospital admission, rate of survival at day 28, rate of return of spontaneous circulation, and ETI and BMV difficulty or failure.

Results

Among 2043 patients who were randomized (mean age, 64.7 years; 665 women [32%]), 2040 (99.8%) completed the trial. In the intention-to-treat population, favorable functional survival at day 28 was 44 of 1018 patients (4.3%) in the BMV group and 43 of 1022 patients (4.2%) in the ETI group (difference, 0.11% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -1.64% to infinity]; P for noninferiority = .11). Survival to hospital admission (294/1018 [28.9%] in the BMV group vs 333/1022 [32.6%] in the ETI group; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -7.7% to 0.3%]) and global survival at day 28 (55/1018 [5.4%] in the BMV group vs 54/1022 [5.3%] in the ETI group; difference, 0.1% [95% CI, -1.8% to 2.1%]) were not significantly different. Complications included difficult airway management (186/1027 [18.1%] in the BMV group vs 134/996 [13.4%] in the ETI group; difference, 4.7% [95% CI, 1.5% to 7.9%]; P = 0.004), failure (69/1028 [6.7%] in the BMV group vs 21/996 [2.1%] in the ETI group; difference, 4.6% [95% CI, 2.8% to 6.4%]; P < .001), and regurgitation of gastric content (156/1027 [15.2%] in the BMV group vs 75/999 [7.5%] in the ETI group; difference, 7.7% [95% CI, 4.9% to 10.4%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, the use of BMV compared with ETI failed to demonstrate noninferiority or inferiority for survival with favorable 28-day neurological function, an inconclusive result. A determination of equivalence or superiority between these techniques requires further research.

### Achieving house staff competence in emergency airway management: results of a teaching program using a computerized patient simulator [^b1f6ff6e]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patient simulation is emerging as a training technique in the field of medicine. It has particular application in training responses to high-risk, low-frequency clinical events, of which a typical example is in-hospital cardiac arrest. A critical element of response by the cardiac arrest team is initial airway management. In teaching hospitals, medical interns are first responders to in-hospital cardiac arrests. Our objective was to design and test a program using a computer-controlled patient simulator to train medical interns and demonstrate their competence in initial airway management.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded trial.

Setting

Internal medicine residency training program in an urban teaching hospital.

Participants

All 50 starting internal medicine interns in July 2002, all Advanced Cardiac Life Support certified in June 2002.

Interventions

All interns were tested in initial airway management skills and then were randomly assigned to receive either immediate or delayed individualized training using a computer-controlled patient simulator. The computer-simulated training process consisted of a scenario of respiratory arrest. The interns were challenged with the scenario twice following testing. The interns were debriefed extensively and given hands-on training by the attending using the simulator until they achieved perfect performance.

Measurements and Main Results

Initial airway management was divided into specific scorable steps. Individual step scores and total scores were recorded for each intern on initial and repeat testing. For 10 months following simulator training, intern airway management skills were scored in actual patient airway events. Despite recent Advanced Cardiac Life Support training and certification, all starting medical interns demonstrated poor airway management skills. The immediate training group showed significant improvement in initial airway management when tested before and 4 wks after training. In contrast, the delayed training group showed no significant improvement. Direct observation of interns in actual initial airway events revealed excellent clinical performance.

Conclusions

Individualized training of medical interns using a computer-controlled patient simulator is an effective means of achieving and measuring competence in initial airway management skills. The improvement appears to be transferable to the bedside of real patients.

### How do paramedics manage the airway during out of hospital cardiac arrest? [^8ebbf367]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

We have documented in detail the airway interventions undertaken by paramedics while resuscitating 196 OHCA patients, and have shown that they made more than one intervention in two-thirds of cases. Just over half of paramedics opted for a bag-mask as their initial airway management technique, with the others split between intubation and a SAD. However, where bag-mask was used as the initial technique an alternative was adopted subsequently in 84%, and in 30% of cases two or more changes were made. When intubation was attempted as the initial technique, a change in airway management was made in one quarter of cases, primarily due to failed intubation, and very few underwent more than one change. SADs fell somewhere between bag-mask and intubation in the subsequent use of alternative techniques. This implies that when a patient is successfully intubated as the initial approach to airway management it is usually definitive, whereas the bag-mask or SAD is used frequently as a 'stepping stone' to ventilate the patient until it becomes ineffective or the opportunity to intubate the patient arises. This approach has potential advantages: a simple airway technique used initially may enable paramedics to focus on chest compressions and defibrillation, moving to more advanced techniques when the situation has become more stable or following ROSC/R. However, changes in airway management may interrupt chest compressions, which is known to be detrimental to resuscitation success, so understanding the frequency and reason for such changes is valuable.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in special circumstances [^6c5e5e4a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation prioritises treatment for cardiac arrests from a primary cardiac cause, which make up the majority of treated cardiac arrests. Early chest compressions and, when indicated, a defibrillation shock from a bystander give the best chance of survival with a good neurological status. Cardiac arrest can also be caused by special circumstances, such as asphyxia, trauma, pulmonary embolism, accidental hypothermia, anaphylaxis, or COVID-19, and during pregnancy or perioperatively. Cardiac arrests in these circumstances represent an increasing proportion of all treated cardiac arrests, often have a preventable cause, and require additional interventions to correct a reversible cause during resuscitation. The evidence for treating these conditions is mostly of low or very low certainty and further studies are needed. Irrespective of the cause, treatments for cardiac arrest are time sensitive and most effective when given early-every minute counts.

Data-driven continuous improvement — although the Chain of Survival emphasizes key elements in the care of an individual patient, it does not sufficiently emphasize steps that are necessary for improving future performance; data collected through registries, such as AHA's Get With The Guidelines (for IHCA) and the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (for OHCA), have been critical to amassing the data needed to improve each link within the Chain of Survival; the goal is to become a learning health care system that uses data to continually improve preparedness and resuscitation outcomes; and application of this concept to resuscitation SOC has been previously supported and is ongoing in many resuscitation organizations.

### Improving outcomes of witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after implementation of International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation 2010 consensus: a nationwide prospective observational population-based study [^9d6e2bfb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The ILCOR 2010 consensus recommended rearranging the order of CPR steps from the "A‐B‐C" sequence in the ILCOR 2005 consensus to the "C‐A‐B" sequence. In adults with sudden, witnessed OHCA, initial arterial oxygen content is high, so chest compressions (to create blood flow) are initially more important than ventilation in the first minutes of sudden arrest. Bystander attempts to administer rescue breaths will delay the onset of chest compressions, particularly if the bystander is not well trained in delivery of rescue breaths. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The change in CPR sequence likely contributed to the improved outcomes. For example, Marsch et al compared the "A‐B‐C" sequence with the "C‐A‐B" sequence for patients with cardiac arrest and showed that "C‐A‐B" was superior to "A‐B‐C" because of the earlier start of compressions and shorter time to completion of the resuscitation cycle. 16 In addition, because clinical outcomes of witnessed OHCA improved after the introduction of this novel "C‐A‐B" sequence in this study, this may suggest its validation for use in general populations.

In this study, neurologically favorable 1‐month survival, 1‐month survival, and prehospital ROSC rates were significantly (P < 0.05) better in patients who received conventional CPR than in those who received chest compression–only CPR for all time periods, including maturation cycles with the exception of neurologically favorable 1‐month survival during early cycle (Table 4). This finding is contrary to most of the published literature. 13, 17, 18, 19 For example, a primary meta‐analysis from 3 randomized, controlled trials indicated that survival to hospital was better with dispatcher‐assisted compression‐only CPR than with conventional CPR, whereas a secondary meta‐analysis included 7 observational studies of bystander CPR showed no difference between the 2 CPR techniques. 19 An explanation for this discrepancy could be that rescuers who provided chest compression–only CPR may be less trained and thus quality of chest compression may be less effective than those provided by rescuers who were trained.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death — SCA is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity such that the victim becomes unresponsive, with either persisting gasping respirations or absence of any respiratory movements, and no signs of circulation as manifest by the absence of a perceptible pulse, and an arrest is presumed to be of cardiac etiology unless a noncardiac cause is known or likely; sudden cardiac death is sudden and unexpected death occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms, or occurring in patients found dead within 24 h of being asymptomatic and presumably due to a cardiac arrhythmia or hemodynamic catastrophe.

2023 Treatment Recommendations

We suggest that family members be provided with the option to be present during in-hospital and out-of-hospital adult resuscitation from cardiac arrest (weak recommendation; very low–certainty evidence), acknowledging that health care professionals are often not able to control this in out-of-hospital settings.

Policies or protocols about family presence during resuscitation should be developed to guide and support health care professional decision-making (good practice statement).

When family presence procedures are implemented, health care professionals should receive education about family presence during adult cardiac arrest resuscitation, including how to manage these stressful situations, family distress, and their own responses to these situations (good practice statement).

### How do paramedics manage the airway during out of hospital cardiac arrest? [^a5af09bc]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

3 Results

This was a cluster randomised trial; patients were enrolled according to the allocation of the paramedic treating them. Of 615 patients enrolled in REVIVE-Airways, 209 (34%) were randomised to usual practice and 198 (95%) received usual practice (did not receive either of the two intervention devices during the resuscitation attempt). These patients were attended by 49 of the 171 paramedics randomised to participate in REVIVE-Airways. The mean (standard deviation) number of patients attended per paramedic was 4.0 (2.6). The dataset was screened for individual paramedic practice, with no evidence that any individual was responsible for a significant proportion of the airway management changes made. The mean patient age was 70.7 years (standard deviation 14.6 years), and the other characteristics of the cardiac arrests are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographics of cardiac arrests included EMS - Emergency Medical Services; PEA - pulseless electrical activity; VF–ventricular fibrillation; VT–ventricular tachycardia; ROSC–return of spontaneous circulation.

Two of the 198 patients had return of spontaneous circulation/respiration (ROSC/R) by the time the paramedic arrived on scene, and required no advanced airway management; they were removed from the analysis. Data from 196 attempted resuscitations were therefore included in the analysis.

3.1 Initial airway management

Initial airway management was carried out using a bag-mask, SAD (Ambu® AuraOnce™ LMA) or tracheal tube (intubation). The numbers of patients receiving each method as the initial approach are shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Initial airway management method and number of further interventions BMV–bag mask ventilation; SAD–supraglottic airway device.

The initial method of airway management was bag-mask for 108 (55%), SAD for 39 (20%) and intubation for 49 (25%) of attempted resuscitations. Paramedics made further airway interventions in 64% of resuscitations: one intervention in 45%, two interventions in 15%, and three interventions in 4% of resuscitations. When intubation was the initial approach, 76% required no further intervention; this compared to no further intervention in 16% and 44% when the BVM and SAD were used initially.

### Prehospital management of adults with traumatic out-of-hospital circulatory arrest – A joint position statement [^48c26a1d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians (NAEMSP), American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), and American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) believe that evidence-based, pragmatic, and collaborative protocols addressing the care of patients with traumatic out-of-hospital circulatory arrest (TOHCA) are needed to optimize patient outcomes and clinician safety. When the etiology of arrest is unclear, particularly without clear signs of life-threatening trauma, standard basic and advanced cardiac life support (BCLS/ACLS) treatments for medical cardiac arrest are appropriate. Traumatic circulatory arrest may result from massive hemorrhage, airway obstruction, obstructive shock, respiratory disturbances, cardiogenic causes, or massive head trauma. While resuscitation and/or transport is appropriate for some populations, it is appropriate to withhold or discontinue resuscitation attempts for TOHCA patients for whom these efforts are nonbeneficial. This position statement and resource document were written as an update to the 2013 joint position statements. NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT recommend.

### Initial airway management skills of senior residents: simulation training compared with traditional training [^f1cf9e20]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Scenario-based training (SBT) with a computerized patient simulator (CPS) is effective in teaching physicians to manage high-risk, low-frequency events that are typical of critical care medicine. This study compares the initial airway management skills of a group of senior internal medicine residents trained using SBT with CPS during their first year of postgraduate training (PGY) with a group of senior internal medicine residents trained using the traditional experiential method.

Methods

This was a prospective, controlled trial that compared two groups of PGY3 internal medicine residents at an urban teaching hospital. One group (n = 32) received training in initial airway management skills using SBT with CPS in their PGY1 (ie, the simulation-trained [ST] group). The second group (n = 30) received traditional residency training (ie, the traditionally trained [TT] group). Each group was then tested during PGY3 in initial airway management skills using a standardized respiratory arrest scenario.

Results

The ST group performed significantly better than the TT group in 8 of the 11 steps of the respiratory arrest scenario. Notable differences were found in the ability to attach a bag-valve mask (BVM) to high-flow oxygen (ST group, 69%; TT group, 17%; p < 0.001), correct insertion of oral airway (ST group, 88%; TT group, 20%; p < 0.001), and achieving an effective BVM seal (ST group, 97%; TT group, 20%; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Traditional training consisting of 2 years of clinical experience was not sufficient to achieve proficiency in initial airway management skills, mostly due to inadequate equipment usage. This suggests that SBT with CPS is more effective in training medical residents than the traditional experiential method.

Emergency call handling for suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest — recognition and location capture: Using the criterion that an individual is unresponsive with abnormal breathing positively identifies 92% of people suffering OHCA. Time to first compression is strongly associated with survival from OHCA. It is critical to first obtain location information when receiving an emergency call (ie, a 911 call) to permit the dispatch of appropriate emergency medical response while additional information is being obtained and CPR instructions are being provided, which permits a response to be mobilized even if the call is disconnected prematurely.

### Considerations on the use of neonatal and pediatric resuscitation guidelines for hospitalized neonates and infants: on behalf of the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^6d1aab11]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Hospitalized neonates and infants — sequence of resuscitation efforts: In the ICU, most children receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation have bradycardia with poor perfusion, and pediatric guidelines call for simultaneous assessment and management by providing airway, ventilation, and oxygenation, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) initiated if compromise persists despite effective oxygenation and ventilation. Neonatal guidance emphasizes ventilation first, noting that mask leaks and upper airway obstruction can cause ineffective positive pressure ventilation (PPV), so neonatal resuscitation focuses on optimizing PPV and performing ventilation-corrective steps, including advanced airway placement, before starting chest compressions. In the NICU, over 80% of arrests start as acute respiratory compromise, and simulation studies warn that starting compressions before ensuring effective ventilation may divert focus; there is no evidence that attempting ventilation-corrective steps before compressions is inferior to starting compressions first. For in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), pediatric guidelines state there are not sufficient data to support a recommendation for advanced airway use; in most hospital CPR events compressions and ventilations are started simultaneously because most patients are already intubated, and thus differences between the pediatric C-A-B approach and a neonatal ventilation-first approach are likely minimal.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^44588e3c]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

NASEMSO Model Clinical Guideline — adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): BVM ventilation is the starting point of positive pressure ventilation for adults with OHCA, and progression to invasive modalities may be necessary but should not compromise chest compressions. Decisions for progression in airway management should be guided by the patient's clinical status based on ongoing assessment, monitoring, transport, and environmental considerations. SGA should be considered as the primary invasive modality, and in systems with appropriate resources and established programs continually assessing intubation performance and demonstrating high ETI success, ETI may be considered.

### Part 4: systems of care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^3790d5a1]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest systems of care (SOC) emphasize several operational priorities: the structure of in- and out-of-hospital resuscitation teams is variable, and adequate training, numbers of responders, and defined roles are crucial to produce good outcomes. Debriefing and feedback to rescuers and analysis of data registries may be important components of a cardiac arrest quality improvement program. In most cases, on-scene resuscitation aimed at achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is preferable to patient transport with ongoing CPR, but this strategy requires that emergency medical technicians and paramedics be adequately trained on when to terminate efforts and how to provide death notifications. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) CPR is a promising but resource-intensive advanced resuscitation technique that requires an organized SOC to select appropriate patients and craft the optimal pathway for care delivery and optimization. More research is needed to identify the optimal components of cardiac arrest centers and determine when scene or interfacility transport to such a center is beneficial. An SOC that integrates inpatient and outpatient services is needed to provide elements of recovery demonstrated to be beneficial in cardiac arrest survivors.

Bradyarrhythmia and asystole management during cardiac arrest — After recognizing bradyarrhythmic or asystolic arrest, focus first on cardiorespiratory control (continue CPR, intubate, intravenous access), reconfirm rhythm in 2 leads if possible, and address reversible causes; pacing is usually ineffective, but reversal of hypoxemia, acidosis, or electrolyte imbalances may help; epinephrine 1.0 mg intravenously every 3 to 5 min is commonly used; for asystole and pulseless electrical activity, atropine 1.0 mg intravenously/intraosseously every 3 to 5 min up to a total of 3 doses or 0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg is recommended; for bradycardia, atropine 0.5 mg intravenously/intraosseously every 3 to 5 min up to a total dose of 0.04 mg/kg is recommended; sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg may be tried for known or suspected preexisting hyperkalemia or bicarbonate-responsive acidosis.

Amniotic fluid embolism — diagnostic approach during maternal cardiac arrest emphasizes inclusion in the differential and clinical diagnosis without specific laboratory testing. Amniotic fluid embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiorespiratory compromise in any pregnant or recently postpartum patient (GRADE 1C), and initial resuscitation does not require a specific diagnosis because initial maternal treatment with basic and advanced cardiac life support is similar regardless of etiology; we do not recommend the use of any specific diagnostic laboratory test to either confirm or refute the diagnosis, and at the present time amniotic fluid embolism remains a clinical diagnosis (GRADE 1C).

### In-hospital cardiac arrest: is it time for an in-hospital'chain of prevention'? [^c669c2ba]. Resuscitation (2010). Low credibility.

The 'chain of survival' has been a useful tool for improving the understanding of, and the quality of the response to, cardiac arrest for many years. In the 2005 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines the importance of recognising critical illness and preventing cardiac arrest was highlighted by their inclusion as the first link in a new four-ring 'chain of survival' However, recognising critical illness and preventing cardiac arrest are complex tasks, each requiring the presence of several essential steps to ensure clinical success. This article proposes the adoption of an additional chain for in-hospital settings — a 'chain of prevention' — to assist hospitals in structuring their care processes to prevent and detect patient deterioration and cardiac arrest. The five rings of the chain represent 'staff education', 'monitoring', 'recognition', the 'call for help' and the 'response'. It is believed that a 'chain of prevention' has the potential to be understood well by hospital clinical staff of all grades, disciplines and specialties, patients, and their families and friends. The chain provides a structure for research to identify the importance of each of the various components of rapid response systems.

Discussion

To address the public health impact of cardiac arrest, focused efforts need to be made on addressing the knowledge gaps in research that will drive innovation and implementation in resuscitation science. As part of this goal, we leveraged the knowledge of resuscitation experts to identify 10 high‐yield science gaps where researchers, stakeholders, and funding agencies may direct resources to improve survival from cardiac arrest. This approach has been used in other areas to improve outcomes by effecting research decisions to direct attention and funding at significant public health problems. 23, 24 In this study, the expert panel generated a list of 10 prioritized knowledge gaps but was unable to reach consensus on the top 3 at our predetermined 75% level.

Using a modified Delphi technique, the top 10 list of knowledge gaps included themes related to out‐of‐hospital and in‐hospital cardiac arrest management. 25 At the onset of a cardiac arrest event, the expert panel noted the importance of leveraging technology to improve rapid identification and response along with enhancing CPR provision by improving bystander and dispatcher response (telecommunicator CPR). As the victim's care is transferred from initial rescuers, optimizing care through improved airway management strategies, hemodynamic monitoring, and individualized goal‐directed management becomes an important consideration. As the patient attains return of spontaneous circulation, experts noted that improved postarrest care and developing tools to assist in neuroprognostication become critical. Finally, in the in‐hospital setting, improved educational strategies would assist healthcare provider provision of care and early identification of patients "at risk" of cardiac arrest, improving patient management to prevent cardiac arrest.

The prioritized list of knowledge gaps identified by the expert panel aligns closely with the recommendations outlined in the Institutes of Medicine report, "Strategies to Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival: A Time to Act". 2 Specifically, the Institute of Medicine report recommends the following: enhancing emergency medical service systems, with an emphasis on dispatcher and high‐performance CPR (eg, gaps 1 and 2, Table 1); improving strategies for in‐hospital arrest (eg, gaps 3 and 5) and special resuscitation circumstances (eg, gap 4); promoting the use of innovative technologies (eg, gap 8) and treatments (eg, gaps 1 and 4); and improving bystander response and CPR provision (eg, gap 6). The concurrence with the Institute of Medicine recommendations lends further credence to the possible impact of addressing these gaps.

Advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) course participation — It is reasonable for health care professionals to take an adult ACLS course or equivalent training (2a; C-LD). Resuscitation councils have offered adult ACLS courses for more than 3 decades and these courses are intended for health care professionals likely to manage adult patients with cardiac arrest, with course content updated to reflect the most recent resuscitation guidelines and recent versions focused on interprofessional, team-based care via simulation-based training. Recommendation-specific supportive evidence includes a systematic review of 6 observational studies enrolling 1461 patients that found higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest when a resuscitation team had at least 1 member completing an accredited ACLS course compared with teams without members with prior ACLS training.

Interactions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance characteristics — when resuscitative efforts are not successful, the panel defines a threshold and a prioritized sequence for optimization: The expert panel proposes that if the patient is not responding to resuscitative efforts (ie, ETCO2 < 20 mm Hg), team leaders should prioritize the optimization of individual components of chest compression delivery in the following order: compression fraction, compression rate, compression depth, leaning, and avoidance of excessive ventilation. Prompt initiation of compressions is the first step toward maximizing chest compression fraction (CCF), and to achieve a target CCF > 80%, careful management of interruptions is critical.

Resuscitative delivery timing and system preparedness: Despite longstanding guidelines recommending that a resuscitative delivery be initiated if ROSC is not achieved within 4 minutes of cardiac arrest, in most cases this intervention is not performed in the recommended timeframe; institutions and organizations that may be required to manage cardiac arrest in a pregnant patient can prioritize developing, training, and implementing processes to perform a resuscitative delivery rapidly and safely, and in cases of IHCA this includes summoning an obstetrician or surgeon, if available, prepared to perform a resuscitative delivery along with requisite tools for the procedure.

### European Resuscitation Council guidelines 2025 executive summary [^445f1f17]. Resuscitation (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines present the most up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the practice of resuscitation across Europe. The ERC Guidelines 2025 are based on evidence produced by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) in the form of systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and evidence updates, published as the ILCOR Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations. The certainty of evidence of these ILCOR treatment recommendations was used to issue the ERC Guidelines 2025 Recommendations. In some cases, the ERC made good practice statements when evidence was absent for certain topics. If no ILCOR review was available, the ERC writing groups conducted their own reviews to provide recommendations. The ERC Guidelines 2025 cover the epidemiology of cardiac arrest, the role that systems play in saving lives, adult basic life support, adult advanced life support, resuscitation in special circumstances, post resuscitation care, newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth, paediatric basic and advanced life support, resuscitation ethics, education for resuscitation, and first aid. These guidelines are a framework of recommendations for the approach to out-of-hospital and in-hospital resuscitation; the implementation is achieved locally taking local legislation and health care regulations into consideration.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, therefore requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis. A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest in contrast to primary circulatory arrest when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

Acute life-threatening events involving children in the radiology department are rare. Nonetheless, radiologists should be competent in the relatively simple procedures required to maintain or restore vital functions in paediatric patients, particularly if their practice involves seriously ill or sedated children. This article gives a practical overview of the immediate management of paediatric emergencies that the radiologist is likely to encounter, using a structured (ABCD) approach. Emphasis is given to the early recognition of respiratory embarrassment and shock, and early intervention to prevent deterioration towards circulatory arrest. The management of cardiorespiratory arrest, anaphylaxis and convulsions in children is also addressed.

### Part 7: systems of care: 2020 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^56b101db]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Survival after cardiac arrest requires an integrated system of people, training, equipment, and organizations working together to achieve a common goal. Part 7 of the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care focuses on systems of care, with an emphasis on elements that are relevant to a broad range of resuscitation situations. Previous systems of care guidelines have identified a Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and early identification of cardiac arrest and proceeding through resuscitation to post-cardiac arrest care. This concept is reinforced by the addition of recovery as an important stage in cardiac arrest survival. Debriefing and other quality improvement strategies were previously mentioned and are now emphasized. Specific to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this Part contains recommendations about community initiatives to promote cardiac arrest recognition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, public access defibrillation, mobile phone technologies to summon first responders, and an enhanced role for emergency telecommunicators. Germane to in-hospital cardiac arrest are recommendations about the recognition and stabilization of hospital patients at risk for developing cardiac arrest. This Part also includes recommendations about clinical debriefing, transport to specialized cardiac arrest centers, organ donation, and performance measurement across the continuum of resuscitation situations.

With the release of the 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care, evidence regarding management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest suggests a more fundamental approach. To aid in understanding and learning, this article proposes a method that optimizes the timing and delivery of evidence-proven therapies with a 3-phase approach for out-of-hospital resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although this model is not a new concept, it is largely based on the 2010 AHA Guidelines, enhancing the philosophy of the "CAB" concept (Chest compressions/Airway management/Breathing rescue).
