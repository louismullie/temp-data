## Question

Heparin dose reduction if supra therapeutic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to reduce a supratherapeutic unfractionated heparin infusion dose and monitor thereafter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "supratherapeutic" using aPTT versus anti-Xa and why that matters. Then, I should verify the immediate actions for a supratherapeutic result, including holding the infusion and by how much to reduce. Next, I will consider special populations and contexts that modify targets or thresholds. After that, I need to check the timing of reassessment and escalation if the result remains high. Finally, I will review bleeding risk mitigation, documentation, and when to switch to anti-Xa–guided dosing if discordance persists.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic targets and definitions, because dose-reduction logic hinges on this. For most VTE indications, aPTT targets are commonly 46–70 seconds or 1.5–2.5 times the control, which corresponds to anti-Xa activity of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL, but I should double-check that this mapping is institution-specific and reagent-dependent, since discordance between aPTT and anti-Xa is well documented and can misclassify patients as supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic depending on the assay pair used [^111kBnyQ] [^116GT7TF] [^11745rBB] [^113LgbKA].

> Wait, let me verify the practical thresholds for action. Supratherapeutic is generally aPTT greater than 90 seconds or an anti-Xa level above 0.7 IU/mL, though some programs use aPTT greater than 80 seconds as a caution zone; importantly, the exact aPTT range that maps to anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL varies by laboratory and must be locally validated, so I need to ensure I am using the correct institutional therapeutic range before labeling a value as supratherapeutic [^111kBnyQ] [^11745rBB] [^116UW1os].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply turning the infusion down. I should confirm the immediate steps. For a clearly supratherapeutic aPTT or anti-Xa, hold the infusion for 1 hour to allow the anticoagulant effect to decline, then reduce the infusion rate by about 3 units/kg/hour. For example, from 18 to 15 units/kg/hour if the prior rate was 18 units/kg/hour, and reassess 4–6 hours after restarting to gauge the new steady state, which aligns with standard nomogram-based practice and FDA monitoring guidance [^111kBnyQ] [^113CKp2u] [^1127UwFY].

> I need to ensure I account for special contexts where targets differ. In ACS without fibrinolysis, aPTT targets are often 60–80 seconds. With fibrinolytic therapy, a lower aPTT target of 50–70 seconds is recommended, so a value of 75 seconds might be supratherapeutic in the fibrinolytic context but therapeutic in standard ACS, which would change the magnitude of dose reduction. Similarly, in pregnancy with mechanical valves, UFH is titrated to keep aPTT at least 2 times control, so "supratherapeutic" in that setting would be substantially higher than in VTE management, and I should adjust accordingly [^115o3zxv] [^1115Cn5u] [^112QMkzB] [^1161WN5a].

> Let me consider pediatric and other high-variability populations. In children, aPTT and anti-Xa correlate poorly, and neonates often require higher heparin doses to achieve target anti-Xa 0.35–0.7 IU/mL. Therefore, I should confirm whether the local protocol uses anti-Xa monitoring in pediatrics and avoid overcorrecting based on a prolonged aPTT alone, which may reflect developmental coagulation differences rather than true supratherapeutic heparin exposure [^112cZ4in] [^111dC8Wg] [^11784q3p].

> Next, I should review the reassessment cadence and escalation if the value remains high. After any dose change, recheck aPTT or anti-Xa in 4–6 hours. If the result remains supratherapeutic, repeat the hold and increase the decrement to about 5 units/kg/hour, and if still supratherapeutic after a second adjustment, I should double-check for assay discordance, heparin accumulation, or clinical bleeding risk and consider switching to anti-Xa–guided dosing if available, since anti-Xa achieves therapeutic levels faster and with fewer adjustments in many cohorts [^111kBnyQ] [^115oWNGx] [^112Rq4R4].

> I will now examine bleeding risk mitigation, because supratherapeutic anticoagulation increases hemorrhage risk even without overt bleeding. I should perform a focused bleeding assessment, review concomitant antiplatelets or thrombolytics, and consider lowering the target toward the low end of therapeutic if bleeding risk is high; in patients at very high bleeding risk or those needing procedures, UFH's short half-life and protamine reversibility make it advantageous, and I should plan closer monitoring and transfusion readiness if indicated [^112qvxe3] [^1127gUxn].

> But wait, what if the aPTT is supratherapeutic while the anti-Xa is therapeutic, or vice versa. I should double-check for assay discordance due to factor VIII elevation, lupus anticoagulant, or other acute-phase reactants. In such cases, anti-Xa monitoring is preferred to avoid over- or underdosing, and I should document the discrepancy and communicate with the lab to ensure the correct therapeutic ranges are being applied locally [^11745rBB] [^113LgbKA] [^111fkeuW].

> I need to ensure documentation is complete and actionable. I should record the supratherapeutic value, the exact time the infusion was held, the prior and new infusion rates, the rationale for the chosen decrement, and the plan for reassessment. This supports safe handoffs and allows trend analysis to detect patterns such as heparin resistance or accumulation that may require alternative strategies [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether switching to anti-Xa–guided dosing improves control without worsening outcomes. Multiple studies show anti-Xa monitoring achieves therapeutic anticoagulation faster with fewer dose changes, and large retrospective data suggest no difference in thrombosis or bleeding versus aPTT, so if discordance or slow aPTT attainment persists, switching to anti-Xa is reasonable, especially in obesity, critical illness, or when high doses are required [^115oWNGx] [^112Rq4R4] [^1146J2VL] [^113h9L8F].

> Let me reconsider the core algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm the supratherapeutic result against the locally validated therapeutic range, hold the infusion for 1 hour, reduce the rate by about 3 units/kg/hour, restart, and recheck in 4–6 hours. If still supratherapeutic, repeat the hold and increase the decrement, and if discordance or repeated supratherapeutic values persist, pivot to anti-Xa–guided dosing and reassess bleeding risk and concomitant therapies. Throughout, tailor targets to indication-specific ranges such as ACS or pregnancy and document all actions and rationales [^111kBnyQ] [^115o3zxv] [^112QMkzB] [^11745rBB].

When unfractionated heparin (UFH) is supratherapeutic, **hold the infusion for 1 hour** and **reduce the rate by 3 units/kg/h** [^111kBnyQ] [^113CKp2u]. Recheck aPTT or anti-Xa **4–6 hours after restarting** and adjust per nomogram; if anti-Xa > 0.7 IU/mL, reduce by 2–3 units/kg/h and recheck in 4–6 hours. If bleeding occurs or anti-Xa > 1.0 IU/mL, **administer protamine sulfate** (1 mg per 100 units of heparin in the last hour, max 50 mg) [^1127gUxn]. Resume UFH at a lower rate once the aPTT/anti-Xa is therapeutic and the patient is stable.

---

## Definition of supratherapeutic heparin levels

Supratherapeutic UFH is defined by an **aPTT above the therapeutic range** (typically 1.5–2.5 times baseline or 60–80 seconds) [^116GT7TF] or an **anti-Xa level > 0.7 IU/mL** [^11745rBB]. These thresholds vary by lab and indication; always use **institution-specific ranges** [^116UW1os].

---

## Immediate actions for supratherapeutic heparin levels

### General approach

- **Hold infusion**: Stop UFH for 1 hour to allow clearance and reduce bleeding risk [^111kBnyQ].
- **Reduce rate**: Decrease by 3 units/kg/h (e.g. 18 → 15 units/kg/h) [^111kBnyQ].
- **Recheck labs**: Measure aPTT or anti-Xa 4–6 hours after restarting to guide further adjustments [^113CKp2u].

---

### Specific dose adjustments based on laboratory values

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Supratherapeutic range** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|-|
| aPTT | > 90 seconds | Hold 1 hour, then reduce by 3 units/kg/h [^111kBnyQ] |
| Anti-Xa | > 0.7 IU/mL | Reduce by 2–3 units/kg/h and recheck in 4–6 hours [^notfound] |
| Anti-Xa | > 1.0 IU/mL | - Hold infusion <br/> - Consider protamine reversal <br/> - Recheck in 4–6 hours [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate intervention

Certain scenarios require **urgent action**:

- **Active bleeding**: Immediate protamine reversal and hold heparin [^notfound].
- **High bleeding risk**: Lower target aPTT/anti-Xa and monitor closely [^112ypWVh].
- **Perioperative settings**: Hold heparin 4–6 hours before procedures; use protamine if needed [^116K2fDz].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent labs**: Check aPTT or anti-Xa every 4–6 hours until stable in range [^notfound].
- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor for bleeding, bruising, or hematuria at each check [^notfound].
- **Platelet counts**: Monitor for HIT (platelet drop > 50% or new thrombosis) [^notfound].

---

## Reversal of heparin effect

Protamine sulfate reverses UFH: **1 mg per 100 units given in the last hour** (max 50 mg) [^notfound]. Infuse slowly over 10 minutes to reduce hypotension and anaphylaxis risk.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: UFH is not renally cleared; no routine dose change is needed, but monitor closely [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Use weight-based dosing; avoid capping initial doses to prevent under-anticoagulation [^115Ehw3K].
- **Pediatrics**: Use anti-Xa–based monitoring when available due to poor aPTT correlation [^115YKwwo].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Hold infusion**: 1 hour if supratherapeutic [^111kBnyQ].
- **Reduce dose**: By 3 units/kg/h after the hold [^111kBnyQ].
- **Recheck labs**: aPTT or anti-Xa 4–6 hours after restart [^113CKp2u].
- **Use protamine**: For bleeding or anti-Xa > 1.0 IU/mL [^1127gUxn].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent labs and clinical assessment until stable [^113CKp2u].

---

Supratherapeutic UFH requires **prompt holding and dose reduction**, with lab-guided titration and protamine for bleeding or very high anti-Xa; **close monitoring** ensures safe, effective anticoagulation.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116Vtu4t]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative laboratory measurement of DOAC therapy — background: The role of measuring DOAC levels before a surgery/procedure is uncertain; unlike an international normalized ratio (INR) measurement where a level < 1.5 is considered safe to allow most surgery/procedures to proceed, thresholds with DOACs are uncertain, with levels of < 30 ng/mL or < 50 ng/mL suggested. A subanalysis of the PAUSE study suggested that pre-operative DOAC levels < 30 ng/mL or 30 to 50 ng/mL were not associated with an increased risk for perioperative bleeding but was underpowered, and further research is needed to define safe pre-operative DOAC levels according to surgery/procedure-related bleeding risk. Potential barriers such as relatively high costs and limited availability can be mitigated if laboratories are configured to run assays with similar 20- to 30-minute turnaround times as with the INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and provide requisite quality control measures.

### Agreement between activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa activity in critically ill patients receiving therapeutic unfractionated heparin [^113LgbKA]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

No study supports the use of either aPTT or anti-Xa activity for heparin monitoring in critical care patients. There are no strong data on the agreement between aPTT and anti-Xa. The aims of this study were to: 1. Analyse the agreement between aPTT and anti-Xa in a large population of critically ill patients under unfractionated heparin therapy (UFH), 2. Identify clinical and biological factors associated to agreement or disagreement, and 3. Analyse the impact of anti-Xa availability on the use of aPTT and UFH therapy.

Methods

Retrospective study in a 35 beds mixed-ICU population between 2006 and 2016 in a University teaching hospital.

Inclusion Criteria

delivery of a UFH dose > 15,000 U/24 h during at least one day with one anti-Xa determination.

Data

demographic variables, aPTT, anti-Xa, laboratory variables, presence of extracorporeal devices (ECD). Pairs of simultaneously dosed aPTT and anti-Xa [aPTT:anti-Xa] were analysed on the basis of their agreement within the sub-therapeutic, therapeutic (aPTT 50–80″, anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 U/ml) or supra-therapeutic ranges.

Results

2283 patient admissions (2085 patients) were analysed. 35,595 [aPTT:anti-Xa] pairs were found. The overall [aPTT:anti-Xa] agreement was 59.6% and lowest (54.3%) in presence of ECD compared to non-ECD patients (61.6%; p < 0.001). Sixteen demographic and biological variables were analysed and were not predictive of [aPTT:anti-Xa] agreement. No significant difference in administered UFH dose was observed after anti-Xa introduction.

Conclusion

In this large cohort, the [aPTT:anti-Xa] agreement is < 60% and significantly lower in patients with ECD. None of the variables identified as potentially affecting the agreement were predictive. Availability of anti-Xa had neither effect on aPTT use nor on UFH-dose. These results call for a prospective study to determine the optimal UFH-therapy monitoring tool.

### Monitoring heparin anticoagulation in the acute phase response [^111ecd82]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). An APTT of 1.5–2.5 times the control is usually taken as the therapeutic range and assumed to reflect an anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) level of 0.35–0.7 u/ml. However, in some cases, despite administration of sufficient heparin to achieve a therapeutic anti-Xa assay level, the APTT remains sub-therapeutic. This 'apparent heparin resistance' is commonly due to high levels of factor VIII (FVIII). In these situations, the anti-Xa is usually preferred for monitoring in order to avoid, what might be, dangerously high levels of heparin. We hypothesized that at high FVIII levels, the heparin resistance encountered may be genuine rather than apparent and that higher doses of heparin may indeed be needed for an equivalent anticoagulant effect. The relationship between heparin level, APTT and anticoagulant effect at different FVIII concentrations was determined using thrombelastography and the thrombin generation assay. Thromboelastographic and thrombin generation parameters concurred with APTT, demonstrating a genuine heparin resistance in the presence of high FVIII levels. This suggests that APTT may be a more accurate measure of anticoagulant effect in vivo than anti-Xa.

### Warfarin sodium [^1129D4ii]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants

Heparin

Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.

As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium should have INR monitoring at least:

5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin, or
4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or
24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.

Warfarin sodium may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (> 50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.

Other Anticoagulants

Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to warfarin sodium.

### Weight-based argatroban dosing nomogram for treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^111Nd3dQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Manufacturer recommendations for argatroban use in the setting of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) state that the dosage should be titrated to a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5–3 times the baseline aPTT. The lack of a clear dosing strategy with argatroban may result in delayed stabilization of aPTT. There are no published nomograms to guide the dosing of argatroban.

Objective

To study the anticoagulant effect and incidence of bleeding and thrombotic events in patients receiving argatroban, with doses determined using a weight-based nomogram.

Methods

Patients with suspected or documented HIT at an 800-bed teaching community hospital were prospectively treated, in a nonrandomized, nonblinded manner, with argatroban; dosage adjustments were made according to 1 of 2 variations of a dosing nomogram: standard or hepatic/critically ill. The primary outcomes were time to aPTT stabilization and percentage of patients whose aPTTs were within the therapeutic range of 45–90 seconds at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients whose aPTTs were subtherapeutic, supratherapeutic, or above the therapeutic threshold of 45 seconds at each time interval; incidence of thrombotic events; number of dosage adjustments to achieve stabilization; and number of major bleeding events.

Results

Fifty-one patients were prospectively treated using the standard (n = 34) and hepatic/critically ill (n = 17) nomograms. Mean time to aPTT stabilization was 16.25 hours with the standard nomogram and 27.05 hours with the hepatic/critically ill nomogram. The percentages of patients with aPTTs within the therapeutic range at each time interval were 82.4%, 82.4%, 88.2%, 96.4%, 100%, and 100% with the standard nomogram and 58.8%, 82.4%, 76.5%, 93.3%, 100%, and 90.9% with the hepatic/critically ill nomogram. There were no thrombotic events after the initiation of argatroban. Three cases of major bleeding occurred.

Conclusions

The nomogram is an effective dosing tool for achieving and maintaining therapeutic levels of anticoagulation.

### Analysis of partial thromboplastin times in patients with pulmonary embolism during the first 48 hours of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin [^114vpaXr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who achieved therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values within 48 hours of treatment.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a PE response team (PERT) database was performed at a large, urban, academic teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute PE for whom the PERT was consulted and who received anticoagulation (AC) with UFH according to guideline standard dosing. aPTT values during 6-hour time periods during the first 48 hours of AC were collected and analyzed.

Results

A total of 505 patients met inclusion criteria. For patients receiving a bolus and infusion of UFH, the proportions (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients in the therapeutic range were 19.0% (14.2% to 25.0%) at 12 hours, 26.3% (26.3% to 33.1%) at 24 hours, 28.3% (22.0% to 35.4%) at 36 hours, and 28.4% (20.8% to 37.5%) at 48 hours. For titrated infusion only, the proportions (95% CIs) of patients were 23.3% (16.2% to 32.3%) at 12 hours, 41.4% (31.6% to 51.9%) at 24 hours, 37.0% (26.8% to 48.5%) at 36 hours, and 42.1% (30.2% to 55.0%) at 48 hours. No patient had all therapeutic aPTT values.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with acute PE spend most of their first 48 hours outside of the therapeutic range of AC when treated with guideline standard dosing of UFH. Over half of the patients fail to achieve any therapeutic PTT level within 24 hours of UFH initiation, and no patient had all therapeutic aPTTs. Future research should focus on identifying factors associated with achieving therapeutic AC with UFH.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116nSAFJ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

### Troubleshooting heparin resistance [^112cmTWc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The term heparin resistance is likely best defined as the failure of an appropriate dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH) to achieve a predetermined level of anticoagulation. Unfortunately, and despite many prior reports, there is no established consensus as to what either the appropriate dose or the predetermined level should be. Traditionally, assays used to monitor anticoagulation with UFH have been clot based, including the activated partial thromboplastin time, used for patients on the ward or intensive care unit, and the activated clotting time, used for patients undergoing vascular interventions and cardiopulmonary bypass. Unfortunately, these tests may be highly influenced by other factors occurring in many patients, especially those with inflammation or acute infection, as noted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospitals have thus moved to anti-Xa testing for heparin monitoring. Another important factor in defining heparin resistance includes dosing, whether weight-based or total daily dosing is used, as initial reports of heparin resistance described daily doses independent of body weight. Multiple causes of apparent heparin resistance include hypercoagulability, antithrombin deficiency, andexanet alfa used for direct oral anticoagulant reversal, thrombocytosis, and antiphospholipid antibody syndromes. Treatment options for managing patients with heparin resistance include weight-based dosing and administration of additional UFH, antithrombin supplementation, or the use of an alternative anticoagulant such as the direct thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin or argatroban.

Regarding medical management for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation, ASH 2018 guidelines recommend to consider continuing anticoagulation at least until platelet count recovery (usually ≥ 150, 000/mcL) in patients with acute isolated HIT and no asymptomatic DVT identified by screening compression ultrasound. Avoid continuing treatment for ≥ 3 months unless HIT persists without platelet count recovery.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111LGyQc]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin dosing strategies and early anticoagulation — In one comparison with identical total dosing (an IV bolus of 5,000 units and 30,000 units per day) using subcutaneous 15,000 units every 12 h vs continuous IV infusion of 30,000 units per day, patients assigned to IV heparin had a significantly lower rate of recurrence than those given subcutaneous heparin; in a randomized trial, fixed dosing (5,000-unit bolus followed by 1,000 units/h infusion) vs weight-based nomogram dosing (starting dose, 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/h by infusion) showed that patients whose heparin was weight-adjusted received higher doses within the first 24 h and the rate of recurrent thromboembolism was significantly lower with the weight-adjusted regimen; in a study of 400 consecutive patients with acute pulmonary embolism, patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT in < 24 h had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates than those who did not.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^113XPJnF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and discussion

Elderly trauma patients using anticoagulants drugs have been steadily increasing. Acute trauma coagulopathy and bleeding occur in 25–35% in trauma patients, 3% of whom are on anticoagulant therapy having an increased risk of bleeding. VKAs, by inhibiting the enzyme Vitamin K oxide reductase, reduce levels of factors II, VII, IX and X and the natural anticoagulants Proteins C and S. These drugs, due to its narrow therapeutic index, their potential of life-threatening effects, and their numerous drugs and food interactions, requires frequent monitoring. Monitoring VKAs is accomplished by measuring the prothrombin time (PT). This assay responds to a reduction of 3 (FII, FVII, and FX) of the 4 vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Although it is simple to perform, PT is limited by the variability of the different thromboplastins reagents in their respone to the anticoagulant effect of VKA. The International normal ratio (INR) was established to standardise the PT assay. It is the ratio between the patient's PT and the PT of normal plasma raised to potential of the international sensitivity index (ISI) of the thromboplastin. PT-INR measurements are an excellent assay for trauma patients using VKAs.

Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan containing a pentasaccharide that binds to and enhances the activity of antithrombin III. This binding reduces thrombin generation via inihibiting coagulation factors (XIIa, IXa, XIa, and Xa). Heparins were classified into Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) and Low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). The most widely laboratory test which measures the anticoagulant in clinical practice is the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). Despite this, there are several factors that can make aPTT monitoring troublesome and questionable. Its sensitivity depends on other variables like standardizing the reagents used, lack of correct synthesis of coagulation factors, consumption of coagulation factors in active bleeding or thrombosis, and liver or hematological disorders increasing baseline aPTT. UFH may also be monitored through anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) activity. Anti-Xa is more efficient in achieving the therapeutic range of UFH compared with aPTT. Nevertheless, this does impact clinical outcome. Compared with aPTT, it is more costly, has little clinical expertise in its interpretation, and is less available. Anti-Xa assay is the gold standard for monitoring LMWH therapy.

### Clinical use of unfractionated heparin therapy in children: time for change? [^11784q3p]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Paediatric recommendations for unfractionated heparin (UFH) management are extrapolated from adult trials, a practice that may contribute to the inferior UFH-related outcomes in children compared to adults. This is the first study to determine UFH concentration in a population of children and correlated UFH concentration with measures of UFH effect. Correlation coefficients between protamine titration (concentration) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), anti- activated factor X (Xa) assay and thrombin clotting time (effect) were 0·59, 0·46 and 0·52 respectively. A protamine titration level of 0·2–0·4 iu/ml in children was not equivalent to an anti-Xa assay of 0·35–0·7 iu/ml but to an anti-Xa assay 0·17–0·85 iu/ml. In addition, use of the anti-Xa or protamine titration assays to establish an APTT therapeutic range resulted in upper limits of APTT ranges exceeding 200 s. Existing methods for determining therapeutic ranges for UFH in adult populations do not produce equivalent ranges in children. As a result, paediatric clinical guidelines that state a therapeutic range for UFH can be determined using a protamine titration assay of 0·2–0·4 iu/ml or an anti-Xa assay of 0·35–0·7 iu/ml are not based on appropriate evidence. There is an urgent need for change in our approach to the use of UFH in children.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1127gUxn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

ACC 2020 bleeding pathway — timing of anticoagulation reinitiation: "In general, all such decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary care team". Conditions with high thrombotic risk favor early reinitiation "once hemostasis is achieved and the patient is clinically stable", and "OAC may be reinitiated with close monitoring in patients with high thrombotic risk; for patients with moderate or high rebleeding risk, individualized strategies are appropriate". As an example of early reinitiation, "parenteral anticoagulants can often be started with close monitoring within 1 to 3 days in most patients". For high rebleeding risk when thrombotic risk is unacceptably high and therapeutic anticoagulation is necessary, "it is suggested that unfractionated heparin be administered by intravenous infusion owing to its short half-life and the availability of a reversal agent (protamine sulfate) that can rapidly stop and/or reverse anticoagulation in the event of rebleeding".

Section 6.2 UFH dosing and monitoring evidence in outpatients: Weight-adjusted subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (SC UFH) monitored with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in three RCTs (n = 937) showed recurrent VTE (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.52–2.46), major bleeding (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.42–4.09), and death (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.62–2.93); in one RCT comparing weight-adjusted SC UFH to weight-based LMWH without monitoring, SC UFH was administered as an initial dose of 333 units/kg followed by 250 units/kg bid, with subsequent UFH dosing kept constant.

### Results of an international survey on the management of therapeutic intensity unfractionated heparin: communication from the SSCs of the ISTH [^115MoD7C]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) remains the anticoagulant of choice in critically ill patients. However, its laboratory monitoring and clinical management are particularly challenging.

Objectives

Our objective was to describe current practices and variations among centers of the ISTH.

Methods

Between November 2023 and February 2024, we surveyed 142 clinicians and laboratory medicine specialists from 15 countries involved in the care of patients receiving therapeutic-intensity UFH.

Results

UFH monitoring was based on an anti-Xa assay or on activated partial thromboplastin time in 54% and 46% of respondents, respectively. Different therapeutic ranges were used depending on local protocols and indications; the 0.3 to 0.7 IU/mL anti-Xa range was commonly used, except for patients on mechanical circulatory support with a lower range, mostly 0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL. Most respondents managed therapeutic UFH administration with weight-based dosing (88%), while fewer used a nomogram (57%) for dose adjustment. When a nomogram was used, it was primarily based on anti-Xa monitoring (86%). The situations when respondents administered antithrombin varied widely; 22% reported using it when antithrombin levels were below 60 IU/dL(%) and 20% reported never using it.

Conclusion

Our survey results revealed considerable heterogeneity in UFH management approaches, reflecting a knowledge gap and a paucity of evidence to guide decision-making. Key issues requiring well-designed up-to-date studies were identified that include optimal approaches to heparin monitoring, assays and reagents to be used, therapeutic range based on indications, the use of weight-adjusted nomograms for initial dosing and titrating of UFH infusion, and indications for antithrombin supplementation. Survey results provide a strong rationale for the development of international guidance addressing these issues.

### How I diagnose and manage HIT [^112Vb8kH]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic drug reaction caused by platelet-activating IgG antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4)/polyanion complexes. Platelet activation assays, such as the serotonin-release assay, are superior to PF4-dependent immunoassays in discerning which heparin-induced antibodies are clinically relevant. When HIT is strongly suspected, standard practice includes substituting heparin with an alternative anticoagulant; the 2 US-approved agents are the direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) lepirudin and argatroban, which are "niche" agents used only to manage HIT. However, only ~ 10% of patients who undergo serological investigation for HIT actually have this diagnosis. Indeed, depending on the clinical setting, only 10%-50% of patients with positive PF4-dependent immunoassays have platelet-activating antibodies. Therefore, overdiagnosis of HIT can be minimized by insisting that a positive platelet activation assay be required for definitive diagnosis of HIT. For these reasons, a management strategy that considers the real possibility of non-HIT thrombocytopenia is warranted. One approach that I suggest is to administer an indirect, antithrombin (AT)-dependent factor Xa inhibitor (danaparoid or fondaparinux) based upon the following rationale: (1) effectiveness in treating and preventing HIT-associated thrombosis; (2) effectiveness in treating and preventing thrombosis in diverse non-HIT situations; (3) both prophylactic- and therapeutic-dose protocols exist, permitting dosing appropriate for the clinical situation; (4) body weight-adjusted dosing protocols and availability of specific anti-factor Xa monitoring reduce risk of under- or overdosing (as can occur with partial thromboplastin time [PTT]-adjusted DTI therapy); (5) their long half-lives reduce risk of rebound hypercoagulability; (6) easy coumarin overlap; and (7) relatively low cost.

### Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: recent advances, unmet needs, and future direction [^11191PKC]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Several caveats are worth noting with the introduction of FXI inhibitors in clinical use. FXI inhibition will result in a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), as FXI is essential in initiating clot formation in vitro as part of the aPTT assay. This might cause concerns about hemostasis, but aPTT and/or FXI levels are poorly associated with true bleeding phenotypes in patients with congenital FXI deficiency (and remains to be seen in those receiving FXI inhibitors). This is because, unlike what happens in vitro, the physiologic hemostasis in vivo is mainly driven by the tissue factor-FVIIa (Fig. 2). Therefore, the aPTT is likely to be a poor predictor of the risk of bleeding in patients receiving FXI inhibitors, although it could be a good marker for the presence of the drug. The resultant prolonged aPTT could also complicate the monitoring of alternative anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin (if used), which can be addressed by monitoring heparin anti-Xa levels (by chromogenic assays). In addition, some FXI inhibitors such as abelacimab have a long half-life (20 days), while studies to date showed that FXI inhibitors are associated with bleeding rates as low as, or lower than standard anticoagulants, inevitable scenarios such as hemorrhage, urgent procedures, or thrombocytopenia will occur, particularly in patients with cancer, and the optimal management strategies in these settings remain to be elucidated. One recent publication has begun the process of developing a proposal to apply similar approaches as managing those with congenital FXI deficiency patients, including the use of antifibrinolytic agents, fibrin glue, and/or low-dose recombinant factor VIIa. Fresh frozen plasma or FXI concentrates are less likely to be effective given rapid neutralization of these exogenous FXI by excess free abelacimab. Further development and validation of effective and safe protocols are needed.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113LAAPz]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of patients who are receiving heparin bridging — pharmacokinetics relevant to timing: LMWHs have an elimination half-life of 3 to 5 hours and a peak action occurring 3 to 4 hours after administration, which informs preoperative interruption and post-operative initiation timing, and UFH has a dose-dependent elimination half-life that is approximately 90 minutes but can vary from 30 to 120 minutes depending on the level of anticoagulation (as reflected by the aPTT or anti-factor Xa levels) at the time of interruption.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^114SdugS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa.

Subcutaneous LMWH and fixed dosed heparin require laboratory monitoring. For patients on therapeutic UFH, serial monitoring of (PTT; also known as APTT) or factor Xa is suggested. The benefit of monitoring IV heparin once a therapeutic threshold has been exceeded is not well defined.

Anticoagulation Forum and American College of Chest Physicians both recommend monitoring anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH because of baseline artefactual abnormalities in PTT and a potential for heparin resistance. None of the guidelines recommend dosing of LMWHs based on anti-Xa levels given lack of evidence on outcomes for thrombosis or bleeding. Body weight–adjusted doses for LMWH appear safer, which may be particularly effective in overweight patients. Elevated PT or PTT is not a contraindication to thromboprophylaxis in the absence of active bleeding. A platelet count < 25 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L constitutes a bleeding risk, warranting holding of standard dose VTE prophylaxis, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation should be withheld if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L.

The role of serial hemoglobin monitoring in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is poorly defined.

We found no data from LMICs regarding the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Speculative explanations for this finding include limited availability of laboratory assays for serological confirmation of HIT, expense associated with using nonheparin anticoagulants, and a lack of awareness of the guidelines.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

A study from Nigeria identified the inability to monitor as a primary reason for reduced clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines. In a separate multicenter survey from six southeastern Nigerian tertiary hospitals, most respondents were able to recognize PT and APTT, but not anti-Xa assay, as laboratory monitoring tools for anticoagulation therapy. This finding correlated with heparin and warfarin as the most commonly administered anticoagulants among respondents.

D -dimer testing might not be readily available in some LMICs and likely would incur a higher cost, although specific pricing in various LMIC environments remains unclear. Early COVID-19 studies suggest wide use of these tests in China, an upper middle-income country.

### Use of the activated partial thromboplastin time for heparin monitoring [^115M7J2U]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the relationship between heparin concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) results, define a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for each aPTT instrument, compare aPTT- and heparin concentration-guided dosage adjustment decisions, and compare laboratory- and bedside aPTT-guided decisions. In phase 1, 102 blood samples were analyzed for bedside and laboratory aPTTs and heparin concentration (used to establish aPTT therapeutic range). In phase 2, 100 samples were analyzed in the same manner. Correlations for aPTT compared with heparin ranged from 0.36 to 0.82. Dosage adjustment decisions guided by the aPTT agreed with those based on heparin concentration 63% to 80% of the time. Laboratory and bedside aPTT dosage adjustment decisions agreed 59% to 68% of the time. The correlation of aPTT with heparin concentration and agreement between aPTT- and heparin-guided decisions vary with the aPTT instrument. Decisions guided by laboratory aPTT results often disagree with decisions guided by bedside aPTT results.

2.2	Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injections.

Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

2.4	Pediatric Use

Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^1172MVUu]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of < 50 × 10⁹/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (< 1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).

### Effect of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin prophylaxis on activated partial thromboplastin time: a retrospective evaluation [^111dAeDv]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Characterize the incidence of elevated aPTT results in patients treated with prophylactic, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Design

Retrospective, cohort analysis.

Setting

Single-center, university hospital.

Measurements

Evaluation of 257 patients with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) testing both prior to and following subcutaneous (SC) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy.

Main Results

Evaluated patients received UFH 5000 units every 8 hours. Baseline aPTT values were within the normal range (mean ± SD, 32.0 ± 8.5 seconds). After initiation of UFH, aPTT values increased (mean ± SD, 37.6 ± 15.2 seconds). After 24 hours of SC UFH, mean aPTT values (mean ± SD, 38.6 ± 15.5) exceeded the normal laboratory range (23.3–35.7 seconds). An elevated aPTT result after UFH was associated with baseline aPTT, length of therapy, and weight-based UFH dose. A significant association was not identified between aPTT elevation and age, race, sex, history of liver disease, type of admission, or transfusion of blood products.

Conclusions

Treatment with UFH resulted in a small, but significant, increase in aPTT.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) — therapeutic range and monitoring in children: The therapeutic range used in pediatrics is largely extrapolated from adults, recommending an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that reflects "a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti–FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL", noting that this "has yet to be confirmed by RCTs". Foundational adult data linked recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk to failure to achieve "an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value" with correlation to "0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration". For monitoring in children, "UFH monitoring using the aPTT titrated to an anti-FXa assay result of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, is associated with significant age-related variation", and "Infants and children can have significantly higher aPTT compared with adult reference ranges". The guideline notes that "Most laboratories do not adjust aPTT therapeutic ranges based on age", and that "pediatric studies report a poor correlation between aPTT and anti-FXa activity", with "some pediatric institutions" using anti-FXa monitoring for UFH.

### A data-driven approach to optimized medication dosing: a focus on heparin [^113pvgzV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate a novel method that utilizes retrospective data to develop statistically optimal dosing strategies for medications with sensitive therapeutic windows. We illustrate our approach on intravenous unfractionated heparin, a medication which typically considers only patient weight and is frequently misdosed.

Methods

We identified available clinical features which impact patient response to heparin and extracted 1,511 patients from the multi-parameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II database which met our inclusion criteria. These were used to develop two multivariate logistic regressions, modeling sub- and supra-therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as a function of clinical features. We combined information from these models to estimate an initial heparin dose that would, on a per-patient basis, maximize the probability of a therapeutic aPTT within 4–8 h of the initial infusion. We tested our model's ability to classifying therapeutic outcomes on a withheld dataset and compared performance to a weight-alone alternative using volume under surface (VUS) (a multiclass version of AUC).

Results

We observed statistically significant associations between sub- and supra-therapeutic aPTT, race, ICU type, gender, heparin dose, age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores with mean validation AUC of 0.78 and 0.79 respectively. Our final model improved outcome classification over the weight-alone alternative, with VUS values of 0.48 vs. 0.42.

Conclusions

This work represents an important step in the secondary use of health data in developing models to optimize drug dosing. The next step would be evaluating whether this approach indeed achieves target aPTT more reliably than the current weight-based heparin dosing in a randomized controlled trial.

### Suboptimal monitoring and dosing of unfractionated heparin in comparative studies with low-molecular-weight heparin [^111w1u6k]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Site-specific validation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic range is required to ensure administration of the optimal dose of unfractionated heparin. Therapeutic ranges of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control value are subtherapeutic for most modern aPTT reagents.

Purpose

To audit the appropriateness of aPTT monitoring in clinical trials comparing unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with venous thromboembolism.

Data Sources

Search of PubMed database from 1984 to 2001.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that compared unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Data Extraction

Use of unvalidated and potentially suboptimal therapeutic ranges for aPTT in patients assigned to receive unfractionated heparin.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. Only 3 studies used a validated aPTT therapeutic range, and 11 studies used a range that included aPTT values 1.5 times the control value. Ten studies reported unfractionated heparin doses, and 7 of these documented a reduction to less than 30 000 U/d in response to aPTT results.

Conclusions

Most studies monitored unfractionated heparin inappropriately. This shortcoming could be responsible for the reduced efficacy of unfractionated heparin in clinical trials.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^116EvZCT]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

What is the optimal type and dose of thrombolytic agent and what should I do if a patient is already on low molecular weight heparin?

Thrombolytic agents for PE should be administered peripherally. Several thrombolytic agents have been studied: urokinase, streptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (alteplase, reteplase, desmoteplase and tenecteplase). Alteplase is the most widely used thrombolytic agent for PE; recommended dosing in patients ≥ 65 kg is a loading bolus of 10 mg over 1–2 min followed by 90 mg infused over 2 h. In patients < 65 kg the total dose administered is 1.5 mg/kg; for example a patient weighing 60 kg should receive a 10 mg loading bolus followed by 80 mg over 2 h. In patients already receiving intravenous heparin we stop the infusion prior to administration of alteplase, check activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 2 h following completion of administration and restart heparin when the APTT ratio is < 2× the upper limit of normal. If there is good clinical response to thrombolysis we would convert to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 24 h following thrombolysis. If therapeutic LMWH had been administered prior to thrombolysis we would usually start heparin infusion as above but delay commencement to 18 h following the last dose of LMWH if once-daily dosing and 8–10 h if twice-daily dosing had been used. Two RCTs have investigated the efficacy and side effects of half-dose alteplase in predominantly submassive PE. Superior efficacy with no increase in bleeding risk was observed when compared with anticoagulation alone, and equal efficacy with less haemorrhage was seen when compared with standard-dose anticoagulation.

Suggested approach: If thrombolysis is indicated for PE we would administer a 10 mg bolus of alteplase followed by a further 90 mg over 2 h (up to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg). If thrombolysis is indicated but there is a high risk of haemorrhage we would consider using a half-dose regimen.

### Should we abandon the APTT for monitoring unfractionated heparin? [^112rypuu]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) but may not accurately measure the amount of heparin present. The anti-Xa assay is less susceptible to confounding factors and may be a better assay for this purpose.

Materials and Methods

The validity of the APTT for monitoring UFH was assessed by comparing with an anti-Xa assay on 3543 samples from 475 patients (infants [n = 165], children 1–15years [n = 60] and adults [n = 250]) receiving treatment dose UFH.

Results

Overall concordance was poor. The highest concordance (66%; 168/254) was seen in children. Concordance (51.8%) or discordance (48.4%) was almost equal in adult patients. Among adult patients whose anti-Xa level was within 0.3–0.7IU/mL, only 38% had an APTT in the therapeutic range whilst 56% were below and 6% were above therapeutic range. Children and adult patients with anti-Xa of 0.3–0.7IU/mL but sub- therapeutic APTT had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared to those with therapeutic or supra-therapeutic APTT.

Conclusions

When the anti-Xa level was 0.3–0.7IU/mL, the majority of samples from infants demonstrated a supra-therapeutic APTT, whilst adults tended to have a sub-therapeutic APTT. This may lead to under anticoagulation in infants or over anticoagulation in adults with risk of bleeding if APTT is used to monitor UFH. These results further strengthen existing evidence of the limitation of APTT in monitoring UFH. Discordance of APTT and anti-Xa level in adults and children may be due to elevation of fibrinogen level.

### The piCTtest is a reliable alternative to the activated partial thromboplastin time in unfractionated heparin therapy management: results from a multicenter study [^114hP4sF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or anti-Xa tests are used to monitor heparin. Prothrombinase-induced Clotting Time (PiCT) was compared to APTT in a clinical study. PiCT shows higher correlation to anti-Xa than APTT does and is more comparable between centers. PiCT demonstrates significantly higher accuracy and reliability than APTT in heparin monitoring.

Summary

Background Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is still a commonly used anticoagulant for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in a variety of situations. Increasingly, chromogenic anti-Xa assays are used for UFH monitoring given the high variability of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in this setting. On the other hand, and despite the known variability, the APTT test remains the most frequently used monitoring tool in UFH therapy because of its broad availability, lower costs and wide acceptance. Various guidelines continue to recommend the use of the APTT as an anti-Xa surrogate, but this approach remains controversial. Objective To assess the prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT ®) test, reported in seconds, as an alternative to the APTT in the management of UFH-mediated anticoagulation. Methods Plasma samples from patients receiving UFH were obtained in three different centers in the USA and Europe. Samples were analyzed for PiCT, APTT and anti-Xa activities with conditions set to allow comparability. Target-ranges in seconds for PiCT and APTT were established for a UFH concentration of 0.3–0.7 IU mL -1, derived from anti-Xa results as suggested by the ACCP guidelines. Results PiCT demonstrated better correlation with anti-Xa IU mL -1 than APTT, higher ability to identify samples within target range and, importantly, comparable target-ranges between different centers. Conclusion Accuracy and reliability of PiCT are significantly better than those of APTT in monitoring UFH for anticoagulant therapy.

### From activated partial thromboplastin time to antifactor Xa and back again [^1135Ub2N]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Monitoring is essential to safe anticoagulation prescribing and requires close collaboration among pathologists, clinicians, and pharmacists.

Methods

We describe our experience in the evolving strategy for laboratory testing of unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Results

An intrainstitutional investigation revealed significant discordance between activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) assays, prompting a transition from the former to the latter in 2013. With the increasing use of oral factor Xa inhibitors (eg, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), which interfere with the anti-Xa assay, we adapted our protocol again to incorporate aPTT in patients admitted on oral Xa inhibitors who require transition to UFH.

Conclusions

Our experience demonstrates key challenges in anticoagulation and highlights the importance of clinical pathologists in helping health systems adapt to the changing anticoagulation landscape.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112QMkzB]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves — peripartum management: For patients on warfarin, switching to twice-daily low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with a target anti-Xa level of 0.8 U/mL to 1.2 U/mL at 4 to 6 hours after dose or to intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) with an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 2 times control at least 1 week before planned delivery is recommended; patients on LMWH should switch to UFH with an aPTT 2 times control at least 36 hours before planned delivery, and UFH should be stopped at least 6 hours before planned delivery; if labor begins or urgent delivery is required while therapeutically anticoagulated with a VKA, cesarean section should be performed after reversal of anticoagulation.

### The optimum number and types of plasma samples necessary for an accurate activated partial thromboplastin time-based heparin therapeutic range [^116CxvCX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Monitoring of unfractionated heparin therapy by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) using the ex vivo method for determining the aPTT-based heparin therapeutic range (HTR) is the standard of practice. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence its accuracy.

Objective

To investigate the optimum number and types of samples acceptable for an accurate ex vivo HTR determination.

Design

Values from patients receiving unfractionated heparin are used to determine the HTR by published guidelines. The number and types of samples are changed to investigate the effect on HTR parameters.

Results

Absolute minimum number of samples for an accurate HTR is 20, with fewer than 10% of the samples from the same patient or 50% of the samples with international normalized ratio of 1.3 to 1.5.

Conclusions

The ex vivo HTR method is the best protocol currently available; however, the number of samples used affects its accuracy. The optimum number of samples is 30 or more but the absolute minimum number is 20. In addition, limitation of specific sample types also affects the HTR parameters. An inaccurate HTR may be calculated if inappropriate sample number or types of samples are used.

### Different heparin lots: does it matter? [^111pGGu5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of heparin lot on the correlation between heparin concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the aPTT therapeutic range, and the heparin level.

Design

Retrospective analysis of data from 2 previous studies.

Setting

Teaching institution with 929 beds.

Patients

Ninety-five patients receiving heparin with 5 different lots (study 1) and 35 patients receiving heparin with 3 different lots (study 2).

Main Outcome Measures

Laboratory-based aPTT and heparin level by anti-factor Xa analysis. Standard heparin curves were created for each lot. Each patient's heparin level was determined off each standard curve.

Results

Correlations between heparin concentration and aPTT ranged from 0.87 to 0.89 (study 1) and 0.86 to 0.87 (study 2). Slopes of regression lines were not significantly different. Therapeutic ranges generated from lot-specific heparin levels were similar. Average bias in heparin levels from varying lots ranged from 0.005 to 0.036 units/mL.

Conclusions

The recommendation to reevaluate the aPTT therapeutic range with each new lot of heparin requires further evaluation.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) monitoring — Therapeutic dosing is "usually monitored using the aPTT", and a retrospective study "suggested that an aPTT ratio between 1.5 and 2.5" led to wide acceptance of "a therapeutic aPTT range of 1.5 to 2.5 times control", yet assay responsiveness varies such that "aPTT results ranging from 48 to 108 s can be measured in samples with a heparin concentration of 0.3 units/mL", and with "heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 anti-Xa units/mL" aPTT ratios "range from 1.6–2.7 to 3.7–6.2 times control"; in the study establishing the range, an "aPTT ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 corresponded to a heparin level of 0.2 to 0.4 units" by protamine and "0.3 to 0.7 units" by anti-Xa, and interlaboratory studies "failed to show that correlating the aPTT with anti-Xa assays improves agreement"; for coronary indications the range "is unknown" but is "about 10% lower" than VTE treatment levels, and a randomized VTE trial showing unmonitored, weight‑adjusted high‑dose subcutaneous heparin twice daily was as safe and effective as unmonitored LMWH "challenge the requirement for aPTT monitoring of heparin administered subcutaneously".

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Lvtn5]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

### Effectiveness of a calculation-free weight-based unfractionated heparin nomogram with anti-Xa level monitoring compared with activated partial thromboplastin time [^112Rq4R4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate monitoring of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is essential to mitigate the risk of adverse drug events associated with dosing errors. Although recent data support anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring preferentially over activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to improve time to therapeutic anticoagulation, the utility of incorporating anti-Xa monitoring with a calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram has not been formally evaluated.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the time to therapeutic anticoagulation of a calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram integrated with anti-Xa monitoring versus a historical control of aPTT monitoring utilizing manual dose calculations.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients with anti-Xa monitoring and a novel calculation-free weight-based UFH nomogram compared with a historical control with aPTT monitoring and manual calculations.

Results

A total of 103 patients in the aPTT cohort and 100 patients in the anti-Xa cohort were analyzed. The anti-Xa cohort achieved goal therapeutic target 3.8 hours sooner than the aPTT cohort (P = 0.03). Patients with anti-Xa monitoring required 1 fewer adjustment per 2.5 patient-days of UFH with the venous thromboembolism nomogram (P = 0.02). Patients in the aPTT cohort required more infusion interruptions because of supratherapeutic values (P = 0.007) and boluses because of subtherapeutic values (P = 0.044). There were no differences in rates of thromboembolism, major bleeding, or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding between the cohorts.

Conclusion and Relevance

This study demonstrated that anti-Xa UFH monitoring integrated with a calculation-free nomogram results in faster time to therapeutic anticoagulation and fewer dose adjustments compared with aPTT monitoring with manual calculations.

### The value of thromboelastography (TEG) in COVID-19 critical illness as illustrated by a case series [^111csG5S]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a practical thromboelastograph guided (TEG) anticoagulation protocol to guide the management of COVID-19 critically ill patients.

Design

An inter disciplinary team reviewed the current literature on hypercoagulability in critically ill COVID-19 patients, clinical management practices and challenges with high rates of thrombotic events despite anticoagulant therapies.

Setting

The largest tertiary care hospital within the Northwell Health System in New York.

Patients

COVID-19 invasively mechanically ventilated patients in Medical Intensive Care Unit Settings.

Methods

TEG was monitored in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patterns were reviewed to guide the development of a treatment protocol leveraging TEG parameters to select anticoagulant therapy. Three patients are reported to highlight TEG profiles that led to the development of the algorithm. Clinical trajectory and treatment decisions were extracted retrospectively from the Electronic Health Record, with input from the intensivists. Anticoagulant use, laboratory and TEG values, and venous/arterial lower extremity (LE) ultrasound results were recorded.

Main Results

These patients demonstrated hypercoagulable TEG results despite prophylactic or therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMHW). TEG surveillance identified functional fibrinogen and maximum amplitude in high-risk patients with hyper inflammatory markers. Anticoagulation assessment, TEG parameters, and LE ultrasound monitoring for venous and arterial thrombus were used to construct an algorithm to guide and escalate anticoagulant therapy.

Conclusions

TEG provides patient-specific evidence for a hypercoagulable state in patients receiving all types of anticoagulant therapy. The proposed TEG algorithm guides anticoagulation management decisions to maintain or escalate anticoagulant dose and/or change choice of anticoagulant. A TEG algorithm may help negotiate the potential harm/benefit balance of full-dose anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, by allowing for a more individualized approach that goes beyond the review of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels.

Acute coronary syndromes — Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing for initial therapy, PCI support, and fibrinolysis is as follows: initial therapy uses a loading dose 60 IU/kg (max 4000 IU) with an initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (max 1000 IU/h) adjusted to a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); to support percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), patients already on anticoagulant therapy receive additional UFH to achieve ACT 250–300 s, whereas those without prior anticoagulant therapy receive a 70–100 IU/kg initial bolus to target ACT 250–300 s; with fibrinolytic therapy, dosing is 60 IU/kg (maximum 4000 IU) plus 12 IU/kg per h (maximum 1000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic aPTT, with the therapeutic aPTT range in this setting 50–70 s.

Management of peripartum antithrombotic therapy

Peripartum anticoagulation management is centered on the careful balance of thrombotic and bleeding risks. It should be planned ahead of delivery with multidisciplinary team input, and include discussion of anticipated timing and mode of delivery. For patients on therapeutic anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitors, induction of labor is recommended so that interruption of anticoagulation can be planned safely. Induction is not routinely indicated for patients on prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and/or aspirin.

Antithrombotic medications should be interrupted to minimize bleeding events, including postpartum hemorrhage and spinal epidural hematoma in those who receive neuraxial anesthesia. Published guidelines for the management of anticoagulation medications in preparation for neuraxial analgesia are summarized in Table 3. While the optimal timing to reinitiate antithrombotic therapy following delivery is not known, resumption of therapeutic anticoagulation following delivery and neuraxial analgesia removal should be guided by individual bleeding risks, indications for anticoagulation, and multidisciplinary team input (Table 3). For most patients, reinitiation of anticoagulation can begin between 6 and 24 hours following delivery.

Table 3
Interruption and Resumption of Anticoagulation According to American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Guidelines and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology Consensus Statement,

Peripartum management of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves requires additional considerations, including the peripartum management of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Fetal metabolism of VKA is delayed, resulting in a prolonged anticoagulant effect on the fetus. As such, discontinuation of VKAs at 36 weeks of gestation with transition to therapeutic LMWH or intravenously (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended in preparation for delivery. Judicious monitoring to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation must occur (target anti-Xa levels = 0.8 U/mL to 1.2 U/mL at 4–6 hours post-LMWH dose or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) = 2 times control for IV UFH). In addition, for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves using LMWH, bridging with IV UFH (starting 36 hours prior to planned delivery until 4–6 hours before delivery) is recommended by expert consensus by both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. In the opinion of this expert panel, the decision to bridge with IV UFH can be individualized based on the valve type, position, presence of atrial fibrillation, or prior thromboembolic events/thrombosis.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^112mghUW]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Heparin resistance

Heparin resistance refers to the requirement for unusually high heparin doses to achieve a therapeutic aPTT, and studies have suggested that it occurs in 21–26% of patients. Several factors have been associated with heparin resistance including nonspecific binding secondary to strong negative charge, AT deficiency, platelet count > 300,000/microL, recent heparin therapy, increased levels of heparin-binding proteins, increased heparin clearance, high levels of factor VIII and fibrinogen and concomitant use of the serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin. Given the importance of ascertaining an early therapeutic aPTT, further research is required to incorporate factors associated with a decreased response into UFH nomograms.

Factors associated with heparin safety

Bleeding

Major bleeding occurs in up to 7% of patients exposed to therapeutic UFH. Risk factors for heparin-associated bleeding include older age, female gender, recent surgery or trauma, hepatic dysfunction, haemostatic problems, peptic ulcer disease, malignancy, reduced admission haemoglobin and concomitant use of other anti-clotting agents (e.g. antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytics). Independent risk factors associated with markedly elevated initial aPTT values on UFH (≥ 2.75 times control) are older age, female sex, lower weight and renal dysfunction. However, aPTT values correlate inconsistently with UFH-associated bleeding and patients can suffer serious bleeding when the aPTT is in the therapeutic range, indicating that underlying clinical predictors appear stronger bleeding risk factors than aPTT. No significant differences in bleeding rates have been observed in patients administered UFH according to nomograms, compared to non-nomogram dosing.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1135XGD1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) qualitative assessment when assays suitable for quantitation are not available — interpretive use of routine coagulation tests: For dabigatran, use thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); Normal TT excludes clinically relevant levels, but Prolonged TT does not discriminate between clinically significant and insignificant levels, and Normal aPTT usually excludes clinically relevant levels if a sensitive reagent is used; for detecting on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, Prolonged aPTT suggests presence of such levels, while Normal aPTT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive reagents. For apixaban, Normal PT and aPTT do not exclude clinically relevant levels, whereas UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels; on-therapy levels are suggested by Prolonged PT, although Normal PT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive PT reagents. For betrixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels and Prolonged PT suggests on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, while Normal PT may not exclude them; the table notes that consideration of anticoagulant reversal is recommended for serious bleeding with a DOAC level > 50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk at > 30 ng/mL.

### Monitoring of unfractionated heparin with the activated partial thromboplastin time: determination of therapeutic ranges [^116UW1os]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to determine therapeutic ranges for unfractionated heparin therapy using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) by calibration against anti-Xa concentration. APTT assays were performed locally, i.e. at the institution of blood collection, on fresh plasma samples from patients treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin. The measurements were performed by 25 Dutch clinical laboratories using 11 different APTT reagents and 10 different types of coagulometers. After the local APTT measurement, the samples were frozen and transported to a central laboratory for measurement of anti-Xa activity. The number of samples from the participating laboratories ranged from 10 to 48. Local APTT results were correlated with the central anti-Xa measurements. Orthogonal regression analysis of log-transformed values was used to calculate APTT therapeutic ranges corresponding to anti-Xa concentrations of 0.29–0.47 IU/ml. The calculated APTT ranges were different between laboratories, even when the same reagent was used. In many laboratories, the therapeutic APTT range in use was much wider than the calculated range. Imprecision of the calculated APTT range was influenced by the wide scatter of the measurement points and by the selection of samples for the orthogonal regression equation. The present results show that, if anti-Xa concentrations of 0.29–0.47 IU/ml reflect the true therapeutic range, many laboratories do not use the proper therapeutic APTT range.

### Delayed efficient anticoagulation with heparin in patients with a weight of 110 kg and more treated for acute coronary syndrome [^115Ehw3K]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of a weight-based nomogram is considered as standard care for prescribing appropriate doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Because of the need for multiple other medications that may affect bleeding and that clinical data have relied on similar dosing algorithms, maximum initial bolus and infusion rates have been suggested (capped initial dose). Whether these weight-based heparin nomograms properly address therapeutic dosing in obese patients remains questionable.

Design and Methods

Thirty patients treated for acute coronary syndrome and weighing ≥ 110 kg were retrospectively compared with 90 controls (three groups of 30 patients, weighting 50–69.9, 70–89.9, or 90–109.9 kg), all treated with UFH, July 2008 to April 2009. The primary end point was the time required to obtain a threshold activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Results

Mean time to achieve threshold aPTT was longer for obese patients weighing ≥ 110 kg than for controls (31.47 vs. 12.89 hours; P < 0.0001). At 24 hours, 63% of obese patients weighing ≥ 110 kg had not reached threshold aPTT vs. 7% of controls (P < 0.0001). However, threshold infusion rate did not differ between weight categories (13.0 vs. 13.1 U/kg/h; P = NS) and approximated the initial infusion rate recommended by nomograms without applying the dose cap (12 U/kg/h).

Conclusions

Adequate anticoagulation time doubled in patients weighing ≥ 110 kg, suggesting that these patients were not receiving appropriate heparin doses initially to achieve threshold aPTT rapidly. Using initial infusion rate recommended by a nomogram without capping for total body weight is suggested as acceptable in this study. This approach should be further evaluated in a prospective study.

Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) initial regimen — for patients starting IV UFH, we suggest that the initial bolus and the initial rate of the continuous infusion be weight adjusted (bolus 80 units/kg followed by 18 units/kg per h for VTE; bolus 70 units/kg followed by 15 units/kg per h for cardiac or stroke patients) or a fixed-dose (bolus 5,000 units followed by 1,000 units/h) rather than alternative regimens (Grade 2C).

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^113uUnmp]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Factors affecting heparin efficacy

As anticoagulant response to UFH is unpredictable, UFH therapy is monitored mainly using the aPTT, although the activated clotting time (ACT) is used to monitor the higher UFH doses administered in PCI and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The evidence behind the aPTT therapeutic range used is relatively weak (1.5–2.5× the control level or upper limit of normal [32–39 s]), as it has not been verified in randomised trials, and patients with a prolonged baseline aPTT cannot have UFH therapy reliably monitored using aPTT. Clinically, failure for rapid attainment of a therapeutic aPTT after starting UFH has been associated with VTE recurrence in some, but not all studies. Interestingly, the risk of 180-day VTE recurrence following an incident VTE was reduced in patients who rapidly attained an aPTT ≥ 58 s on UFH, but not in patients with rapid attainment of aPTT ≥ 40 s. Conversely, during the median six day duration of UFH therapy, the proportion of time with an aPTT ≥ 40 s, but not ≥ 58 s, was associated with a reduced hazard of VTE recurrence. Markedly low aPTTs (< 1.25x control) taken 4–6 h after starting UFH therapy have also been associated with recurrent myocardial infarction.

A barrier to the rapid attainment of a therapeutic aPTT is under-dosing of both UFH loading and infusion maintenance doses. Thus UFH nomograms have been developed, which significantly increase the proportion of patients reaching a therapeutic aPTT within 24 h compared to clinical judgement. UFH nomograms standardise the loading and initial heparin infusion rate and provide an algorithm for rate adjustments based on aPTT measurements; both weight and non-weight based nomograms are available. Nevertheless, in a RCT sub-analysis including 6,055 patients with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction who received UFH according to a weight-based nomogram, only 33.8% of initial aPTTs fell within the therapeutic range; 13.2% and 16.3% were markedly low and high, respectively. Factors associated with markedly low initial aPTT values on UFH included increased weight and younger age. Even when the initial aPTT on UFH using a nomogram is within the therapeutic range, it is maintained over the next two measurements in only 29% of patients.

### Comparing anti-factor Xa and activated partial thromboplastin levels for monitoring unfractionated heparin [^116WoACt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Lab tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels are typically used to monitor intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV heparin), with recent evidence suggesting that anti-Xa levels may provide a more accurate measure of anticoagulation. Objective: The Lexington Veterans Affairs Health Care System transitioned from using aPTT to anti-Xa levels in January 2017. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this change. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing all patients receiving IV heparin per protocol for at least 24 hours from August 1, 2016, to January 31, 2017 (aPTT group), and February 1, 2017, to July 31, 2017 (anti-Xa group). The primary objective was a comparison of IV heparin doses required to achieve goal range between the 2 cohorts. Secondary objectives included a comparison of time to therapeutic goal, percentage of time within goal range, number of rate changes until therapeutic goal, and adverse outcomes, such as number of bleeds. Results: A total of 155 patients were included in this study. Significantly higher IV heparin doses were required to achieve therapeutic goal in the anti-Xa group, despite significantly fewer IV heparin rate changes required. Anti-Xa monitoring was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Conclusion and Relevance: Significantly higher IV heparin doses were required to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels after transitioning from an aPTT-based protocol in the largely unstudied veteran population. However, the transition from aPTT to anti-Xa monitoring appears safe and efficacious in these patients.

### Assessment of anticoagulation in patients receiving ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for treatment of pulmonary embolism [^116Yu2eM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound-assisted, catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT) has emerged as a popular treatment option for submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). The optimal strategy for transitioning patients from full-intensity to reduced-intensity heparin during the procedure has yet to be established.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the anticoagulation management in patients receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis with USAT.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who received USAT for the treatment of PE. Institutional review board approval was obtained. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients with a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prior to and during tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion. Secondary outcomes included heparin requirements, the rate of bleeding complications, and the appropriateness of long-term venous thromboembolism management.

Results

A therapeutic aPTT value was achieved in 32 patients (54.2%) prior to USAT and 35 patients (59.3%) during tPA infusion. Heparin requirements were reduced from 15.1 ± 4.1 to 12.8 ± 4.2 U/kg/h for patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT both prior to and during tPA infusion. Bleeding occurred in 34.4% of patients and tended to be minimal (20.3%) or minor (10.9%). The majority of patients were discharged on a direct oral anticoagulant (63%), followed by warfarin (32%) and enoxaparin (5%). Conclusion and Relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first study that has assessed heparin management in the setting of USAT. The results of these data may aid in empirically dose adjusting unfractionated heparin to ensure safe and effective anticoagulation for patients receiving USAT.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^116x78d6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Frequent inpatient monitoring of serum coagulation parameters may be feasible for some LMIC facilities, but limited in many others. In situations where the costs of inpatient laboratory testing are passed to the patient or the family, these costs can quickly become prohibitive, so laboratory testing must be ordered judiciously.

The most common anticoagulant used in many LMIC settings for initial inpatient treatment is UFH. The major feasibility issue with UFH is the need for frequent blood draws to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) levels.

Limited laboratory capacity in some LMIC settings may preclude safe inpatient administration of continuous UFH infusion, although a fixed-dose weight and renal adjusted UFH protocol may be a safe alternative where LMWH is unavailable. Low molecular weight heparin requires no laboratory monitoring, but is typically more expensive for inpatients and may not be as readily available in some settings. Despite the high drug cost, studies from Europe and Brazil suggest that outpatient treatment of VTE with LMWH may save as much as US$1,641 per patient compared with inpatient UFH therapy. This cost saving analysis likely is irrelevant for the hospitalized COVID-19 patient given the low likelihood of outpatient therapy for this disease.

After the initial heparin-based therapy, the most common outpatient anticoagulant used in LMICs is warfarin. Warfarin is well studied, having been used for many years, and low cost generic versions are readily available throughout the world. The need for and costs associated with necessary laboratory monitoring of INR for warfarin patients, however, may be difficult in most resource-limited settings in LMICs. Even in facilities with relatively ample resources, appropriate treatment based on INR can be challenging.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, even in the absence of testing (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or DOACs for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight and renal function, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence)

How should COVID-19 patients on treatment for VTE be routinely monitored in LMICs?

### Comparing methods of establishing the aPTT therapeutic range of heparin [^117TuKYy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends that the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic range for unfractionated heparin be defined as the aPTT corresponding to a heparin concentration of 0.3–0.7 micro/mL by heparin anti-factor Xa assay. This recommendation suggests that a therapeutic range defined in this manner should be superior to traditional empiric therapeutic ranges of 1.5–2.5 times the control. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the ACCP recommendation for heparin monitoring.

Objective

To compare heparin dosage adjustments guided by a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range (HCDTR) with those influenced by traditional empiric therapeutic ranges for the aPTT.

Methods

This study was conducted in 2 phases. In phase 1, the various aPTT therapeutic ranges were established and/or defined. The first empiric therapeutic range (E1) was established by performing an aPTT test on healthy volunteers. This E1 was defined as 1.5–2.5 times the mean normal aPTT. A second empiric therapeutic range (E2) was defined as 1.5–2.5 times the patient's baseline aPTT. The aPTT HCDTR had been defined in a previous study as 48–61 seconds. In phase 2, heparin dosage adjustment decisions guided by each empiric range and the HCDTR for the aPTT were compared with heparin dosage adjustment decisions guided by actual heparin concentrations. Decisions were in agreement when both the aPTT result and plasma heparin concentration indicated the same dosage change. Forty patients had a bedside aPTT determined prior to receiving continuous infusion heparin and again within 48 hours of heparin initiation. Plasma heparin concentration by anti-factor Xa assay was performed on the blood samples obtained after heparin initiation. Heparin dosage adjustment decisions were evaluated by determining the agreement of each aPTT test result with the corresponding plasma heparin concentration. An overall level of agreement (defined as the % of decisions that were in agreement) for each aPTT therapeutic range was determined.

Results

The level of agreement in dosage adjustment decisions between heparin concentration and E1, E2, and HCDTR was 28/40 (70%), 28/39 (72%), and 23/40 (58%), respectively (p = 0.34). Heparin dosage adjustment decisions based on an aPTT HCDTR did not significantly differ from heparin dosage adjustment decisions guided by traditional empiric therapeutic ranges for a bedside aPTT.

Conclusions

This pilot study showed similar heparin dosage adjustment decisions using an empiric aPTT therapeutic range versus a heparin concentration-derived aPTT therapeutic range.

### Impact of a pharmacist-directed anticoagulation service on the quality and safety of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia management [^113quFjt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The use of anticoagulant medications is complex and prone to error in the inpatient setting. Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) must receive treatment with alternative anticoagulant agents to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of an inpatient pharmacist-directed anticoagulation service (PDAS) on the safety and efficiency of direct thrombin inhibitor use in patients with HIT.

Methods

This was a quasi-experimental pre/postintervention study comparing patients with HIT managed with usual care to patients managed with a focused inpatient anticoagulation service. The primary endpoints of the study were the percent of time that the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) remained within the therapeutic range and time to achievement of a therapeutic aPTT. Bleeding and appropriateness of warfarin initiation were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

Results

A total of 193 patients were included in the study. Percent of time that aPTT was in the therapeutic range was 32% higher with the PDAS (p < 0.001) and time to therapeutic aPTT was shortened by approximately 12.5 hours in patients managed by the PDAS (p < 0.001). There was a trend for more bleeding events, regardless of severity, among control patients (p = 0.130). Rate of TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding was lower in the PDAS group (p = 0.006), but there was no significant difference between groups in GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) moderate/severe bleeding (p = 0.679). Appropriateness of warfarin initiation was also similar between groups.

Conclusions

Implementation of a focused inpatient PDAS was associated with improved efficiency of dosing, improved monitoring, and low bleeding risk.

### How I treat catastrophic thrombotic syndromes [^111iseCQ]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Catastrophic thrombotic syndromes are characterized by rapid onset of multiple thromboembolic occlusions affecting diverse vascular beds. Patients may have multiple events on presentation, or develop them rapidly over days to weeks. Several disorders can present with this extreme clinical phenotype, including catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), atypical presentations of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and Trousseau syndrome, but some patients present with multiple thrombotic events in the absence of associated prothrombotic disorders. Diagnostic workup must rapidly determine which, if any, of these syndromes are present because therapeutic management is driven by the underlying disorder. With the exception of atypical presentations of TTP, which are treated with plasma exchange, anticoagulation is the most important therapeutic intervention in these patients. Effective anticoagulation may require laboratory confirmation with anti-factor Xa levels in patients treated with heparin, especially if the baseline (pretreatment) activated partial thromboplastin time is prolonged. Patients with catastrophic APS also benefit from immunosuppressive therapy and/or plasma exchange, whereas patients with HIT need an alternative anticoagulant to replace heparin. Progressive thrombotic events despite therapeutic anticoagulation may necessitate an alternative therapeutic strategy. If the thrombotic process can be controlled, these patients can recover, but indefinite anticoagulant therapy may be appropriate to prevent recurrent events.

### APTT therapeutic range for monitoring unfractionated heparin therapy. significant impact of the anti-Xa reagent used for correlation [^11745rBB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy is monitored by using the anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) activity, or the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which remains the most widely used assay. One of the main advantages of anti-Xa relies on its hypothesized standardization, with a unique therapeutic range (0.30–0.70 IU/ml) for all reagents, whereas APTT is influenced by numerous preanalytical and analytical parameters not related to the anticoagulant activity of UFH.

Methods

The aim of this study was to compare the anti-Xa-correlated APTT therapeutic ranges calculated using different combinations of APTT (n = 4) and anti-Xa reagents (n = 4) in frozen citrated plasmas from 87 inpatients on UFH.

Results

The median APTT ratio ranged from 2.19 for the less sensitive to 3.23 for the most sensitive reagent, whereas the median anti-Xa activity was between 0.37 IU/ml and 0.57 IU/ml. The APTT therapeutic ranges calculated to correlate with anti-Xa activities between 0.30 and 0.70 IU/ml were found to be highly different from one combination of APTT reagent and analyzer to another. The same applied to the therapeutic range of a single APTT reagent calculated using different anti-Xa assays performed on the same analyzer, leading to a lack of agreement as to whether a sample was classified as subtherapeutic, therapeutic or supratherapeutic in 8.0% to 23.0% of the patients, with kappa coefficients between 0.908 and 0.753.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the APTT therapeutic range calculated to correlate with anti-Xa activities between 0.30 and 0.70 IU/ml is influenced not only by the APTT reagent, but also by the anti-Xa reagent used for calculation.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing and monitoring in children are outlined, including an initial loading dose range, therapeutic target, and a monitoring recommendation. A loading dose of 75 to 100 IU/kg is reported to achieve therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in most children, and the maintenance dose needed to reach the adult therapeutic range corresponding to an anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 is higher in neonates than older children and is gestational age dependent. Both aPTT and anti-FXa are used clinically, but studies show poor correlation and no superiority for predicting thrombosis or bleeding; therefore, we suggest that clinicians consistently use 1 test to monitor patients on UFH anticoagulation.

Fondaparinux

Therapeutic range

Fondaparinux is not routinely monitored in adults but, if required, can be monitored using an anti-FXa activity assay, calibrated with fondaparinux. Target peak concentration for therapeutic anticoagulation in adults is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and this range has been extrapolated to children treated with fondaparinux. Fondaparinux does not usually affect routine coagulation tests, prothrombin time, or aPTT, when used in therapeutic doses but can cause aPTT prolongation at higher doses.

Dosing/dose frequency

A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years. This is based on an open-label prospective study (FondaKIDS) of 24 children treated for DVT or HIT. Dosing was adjusted to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours, tested initially after the first dose, with 88% of individuals achieving the target concentration without dose adjustment.

Periprocedural management

The anticoagulant effect of fondaparinux may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function because of its long elimination half-life.

Management of bleeding

There is no antidote to fondaparinux. Bleeding should be managed as per protocols for managing bleeding due to other irreversible anticoagulants.

Warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon

Therapeutic range

Target therapeutic ranges for children are currently extrapolated from the therapeutic ranges used in adults for the different indications. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children for the treatment of VTE is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). High-risk conditions may require a higher range of 2.5 to 3.5. As yet, there have been no clinical trials to assess appropriate INR ranges for children.

Pregnancy anticoagulation — peripartum management: It is recommended that the mother be hospitalized before planned delivery, with discontinuation of long-acting anticoagulation and initiation of intravenous continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) to keep activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) > 2 times control levels, and intravenous heparin should be stopped long enough before delivery (typically at least 6 hours) to reduce maternal bleeding and allow safe placement of epidural anesthesia.

### Activated partial thromboplastin time versus antifactor Xa heparin assay in monitoring unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion [^115oWNGx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been used clinically for 5 decades. Despite being a cornerstone of anticoagulation, UFH is limited by its unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, which makes close laboratory monitoring necessary. The most common methods for monitoring UFH are the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antifactor Xa heparin assay (anti-Xa HA), but both present challenges, and the optimal method to monitor UFH remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the performance of the aPTT with the anti-Xa HA for efficiency and safety of monitoring intravenous UFH infusions.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in an 852-bed academic medical center.

Results

One hundred patients receiving intravenous UFH for a variety of indications were enrolled in the study; 50 were assigned to each group. The mean (SD) time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation was significantly less in the anti-Xa HA group compared with the aPTT group (28 [16] vs 48 [26] hours, p < 0.001). In addition, a greater percentage of anti-Xa HA patients compared to aPTT patients achieved therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 hours (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 8.7) and 48 hours (OR 10.9; 95% CI 3.3 to 44.2). Patients in the anti-Xa HA group also had more test values within the therapeutic range (66% vs 42%, p < 0.0001). A significant difference was seen between the 2 groups in the number of aPTT or anti-Xa HA tests performed per 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and number of infusion rate changes per 24 hours (p < 0.01), both favoring the anti-Xa HA group.

Conclusions

Monitoring intravenous UFH infusions with the anti-Xa HA, compared to the aPTT, achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more rapidly, maintains the values within the goal range for a longer time, and requires fewer adjustments in dosage and repeated tests.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^113CKp2u]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection.

Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112qvxe3]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin monitoring and bleeding risk — The risk of heparin-associated bleeding increases with heparin dose and with concomitant administration of fibrinolytic agents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and it is also increased by recent surgery, trauma, invasive procedures, or concomitant hemostatic defects; in hospitalized patients, increasing number of comorbidities, age ≥ 60 y, supratherapeutic clotting times, and worsening hepatic dysfunction increase the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding. Because the anticoagulant response to heparin varies among patients, it is standard practice to monitor heparin and to adjust the dose based on the results of coagulation tests. The evidence for adjusting the dose of heparin to maintain a "therapeutic range" is weak, whereas the evidence for maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) within a "therapeutic range" in vitamin K antagonist therapy is strong.

Coagulation assays: measuring the effect of dabigatran

Prothrombin time /international normalised ratio

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, reduce the levels of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. The prothrombin time (PT) is particularly sensitive to a reduction in factor VII, and, as a result, treatment with vitamin K antagonists results in prolongation of the PT. This is usually expressed as a standardised ratio (the international normalised ratio (INR)), which is used to monitor the therapeutic anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

The PT/INR is insensitive to dabigatran at therapeutic levels. It may be prolonged by supratherapeutic levels of dabigatran, but the results will vary widely between laboratories, because of variation in the sensitivity of different reagents to the effect of dabigatran. Neither a laboratory-based nor point-of-care PT/INR can be used to assess the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.

Activated partial thromboplastin time

The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) provides a measure of the intrinsic (factors VIII, IX and XI) and common (factors II, V, X and fibrinogen) coagulation pathway. The APTT can be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin. The APTT displays a curvilinear dose response to increasing plasma concentrations of dabigatranand may be used to demonstrate that a patient is anticoagulated with dabigatran — for example, if a patient is bleeding or needs surgery. However, it does not provide a quantitative measurement and should not be used for routine monitoring.

In the stroke prevention trial, the APTT ratio was 1.4–2.3 in patients receiving 150 mg twice a day, and 1.3–2.1 in those receiving 110 mg twice a day, with a peak effect seen 2 h after administration. Prolongation of the APTT is maintained for at least 8–12 h, with a measurable effect still seen in some patients after 24 h. If the APTT is prolonged by 2–3-fold at trough (when the next dose is due), there is a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, knowledge of the time of last dose is important for interpretation of the APTT, particularly if an invasive procedure is planned.

### Comparison of managing factor Xa inhibitor to unfractionated heparin transitions by aPTT versus a treatment guideline utilizing heparin anti-Xa levels [^117RFcAD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are inadequate data on the optimal strategy for transitioning factor Xa inhibitors (FXai; apixaban, rivaroxaban) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions.

Objective

In patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion, this study compared the safety and efficacy of monitoring UFH infusions using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) titration scale versus utilizing an UFH-calibrated anti-Xa titration scale aided by a novel institutional guideline.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on adult patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion at 2 medical centers from June 1, 2018, to November 1, 2020. One institution utilized aPTT while the other institution primarily used UFH-calibrated anti-Xa. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, major bleeding, or new thrombosis during the hospitalization with a planned noninferiority analysis. Secondary outcomes were also collected including the amount and duration of UFH administered between cohorts.

Results

The incidence rate of the primary composite endpoint was 6.3% in the anti-Xa group and 11% in the aPTT group (P < 0.001 for noninferiority, P = 0.138 for superiority) meeting noninferiority criteria. No statistical differences were seen in new thrombosis, major bleeding, or any bleeding.

Conclusion and Relevance

This represents the first report of a comparison between aPTT versus anti-Xa monitoring in relation to clinical outcomes for patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion. A transition guideline primarily utilizing an UFH-calibrated anti-Xa assay appears to be a safe alternative to aPTT monitoring and can aid facilities in the management of patients during these complex transitions.

Peripartum anticoagulation and neuraxial anesthesia considerations — The panel agreed that a multidisciplinary, individualized approach should be used when planning delivery and anesthesia for women receiving anticoagulants, and defined primary postpartum hemorrhage as the loss of ≥ 500 mL of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of delivery with uterine atony and trauma as main causes. Current North American and European anesthetic guidelines call for at least a 24-hour interval between the last dose of greater-than-prophylactic-dose LMWH and placement of an epidural catheter. The panel also noted other options: conversion to intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) with cessation 4 to 6 hours before delivery and a repeat activated partial thromboplastin time drawn after 4 hours to confirm normalization, which would be appropriate in patients considered at high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (e.g., proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) diagnosed 2 to 4 weeks before delivery.

### Clinical outcomes with unfractionated heparin monitored by anti-factor Xa vs. activated partial thromboplastin time [^1146J2VL]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is associated with less time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation compared to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, it is unknown whether clinical outcomes differ between these methods of monitoring. The aim of this research was to compare the rate of venous thrombosis and bleeding events in patients that received UFH monitored by anti-Xa compared to the aPTT. A retrospective review of electronic health records identified adult patients that received UFH given intravenously (IV) for ≥ 2days, with either anti-Xa or aPTT monitoring at an academic tertiary care hospital. This was a pre/post study design conducted between January 1 to December 30, 2014 (aPTT), and January 1 to December 30, 2016 (anti-Xa). All UFH adjustments were based on institutional nomograms. The primary outcome was venous thrombosis and the secondary outcome was bleeding, both of which occurred between UFH administration and discharge from the index hospitalization. A total of 2500 patients were in the anti-Xa group and 2847 patients aPTT group. Venous thrombosis occurred in 10.2% vs 10.8% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.49). Bleeding occurred in 33.7% vs 33.6% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.94). Anti-Xa monitoring was not an independent predictor of either outcome in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study found no difference in clinical outcomes between anti-Xa and aPTT-based monitoring of UFH IV.

### Antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115YKwwo]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Neonates and children differ from adults in physiology, pharmacologic responses to drugs, epidemiology, and long-term consequences of thrombosis. This guideline addresses optimal strategies for the management of thrombosis in neonates and children.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Results

We suggest that where possible, pediatric hematologists with experience in thromboembolism manage pediatric patients with thromboembolism (Grade 2C). When this is not possible, we suggest a combination of a neonatologist/pediatrician and adult hematologist supported by consultation with an experienced pediatric hematologist (Grade 2C). We suggest that therapeutic unfractionated heparin in children is titrated to achieve a target anti-Xa range of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL or an activated partial thromboplastin time range that correlates to this anti-Xa range or to a protamine titration range of 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL (Grade 2C). For neonates and children receiving either daily or bid therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin, we suggest that the drug be monitored to a target range of 0.5 to 1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4 to 6 h after subcutaneous injection or, alternatively, 0.5 to 0.8 units/mL in a sample taken 2 to 6 h after subcutaneous injection (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

The evidence supporting most recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children remains weak. Studies addressing appropriate drug target ranges and monitoring requirements are urgently required in addition to site- and clinical situation-specific thrombosis management strategies.

### Heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111icyia]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article about unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. UFH is a heterogeneous mixture of glycosaminoglycans that bind to antithrombin via a pentasaccharide, catalyzing the inactivation of thrombin and other clotting factors. UFH also binds endothelial cells, platelet factor 4, and platelets, leading to rather unpredictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Variability in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents necessitates site-specific validation of the aPTT therapeutic range in order to properly monitor UFH therapy. Lack of validation has been an oversight in many clinical trials comparing UFH to LMWH. In patients with apparent heparin resistance, anti-factor Xa monitoring may be superior to measurement of aPTT. LMWHs lack the nonspecific binding affinities of UFH, and, as a result, LMWH preparations have more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. LMWHs have replaced UFH for most clinical indications for the following reasons: (1) these properties allow LMWHs to be administered subcutaneously, once daily without laboratory monitoring; and (2) the evidence from clinical trials that LMWH is as least as effective as and is safer than UFH. Several clinical issues regarding the use of LMWHs remain unanswered. These relate to the need for monitoring with an anti-factor Xa assay in patients with severe obesity or renal insufficiency. The therapeutic range for anti-factor Xa activity depends on the dosing interval. Anti-factor Xa monitoring is prudent when administering weight-based doses of LMWH to patients who weigh > 150 kg. It has been determined that UFH infusion is preferable to LMWH injection in patients with creatinine clearance of < 25 mL/min, until further data on therapeutic dosing of LMWHs in renal failure have been published. However, when administered in low doses prophylactically, LMWH is safe for therapy in patients with renal failure. Protamine may help to reverse bleeding related to LWMH, although anti-factor Xa activity is not fully normalized by protamine. The synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux is a promising new antithrombotic agent for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.

2.8 Conversion from Other Anticoagulants

Heparin

Since the full anticoagulant effect of JANTOVEN is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with JANTOVEN, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to JANTOVEN may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap JANTOVEN therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until JANTOVEN has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.

As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and JANTOVEN should have INR monitoring at least:

5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin, or
4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or
24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.

JANTOVEN may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (> 50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.

Other Anticoagulants

Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to JANTOVEN.

### Activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-xa measurements in heparin monitoring: biochemical basis for discordance [^111fkeuW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

We examined the concordance of heparin levels measured by a chromogenic anti-Xa assay and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) during unfractionated heparin therapy (UFH) and the biochemical basis for differences between these measures. We also investigated the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) as a possible measure of anticoagulation. Paired measures of anti-Xa and APTT were performed on 569 samples from 149 patients on UFH. The anti-Xa values and the APTT were concordant in only 54% of measurements. One hundred twelve samples from 59 patients on UFH were assayed for APTT, anti-Xa, factor II, factor VIII, and ETP. Supratherapeutic APTT values but therapeutic anti-Xa results had decreased factor II activity. Subtherapeutic APTT but therapeutic anti-Xa values had high factor VIII activity. ETP correlated with anticoagulation status and UFH dose. In conclusion, factor II and VIII activity contributes to discordance between APTT and anti-Xa results. ETP measurements may provide an additional assessment of anticoagulation status.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^113HQLtH]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to intravenous heparin, BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend to consider administering continuous infusion UFH in patients with perceived coexisting high risk of bleeding. Consider administering weight adjusted doses (such as 10 mcg/kg/hour) without the intention of prolonging the aPTT ratio 1.5–2.5 times the control. Observe clinical signs of bleeding because monitoring the aPTT in these patients may be complicated.

Recommendation 3.2 — therapeutic-intensity versus prophylactic-intensity dosing in acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) or acute isolated HIT: In patients with acute HITT or acute isolated HIT, the ASH guideline panel recommends treatment with a non-heparin anticoagulant at therapeutic-intensity dosing rather than prophylactic-intensity dosing (strong recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). The guideline panel identified 1 randomized controlled trial comparing therapeutic with prophylactic doses in this population and 2 prospective cohorts evaluating danaparoid, lepirudin, and fondaparinux; the danaparoid comparison found therapeutic intensity may reduce thrombotic events by 50%, the lepirudin comparisons suggested no difference in thrombotic events or platelet response, the fondaparinux comparison found no differences in thrombotic events or mortality, and an increase in bleeding with therapeutic compared with prophylactic dosing is probable. The panel agreed that providing therapeutic-intensity dosing is feasible and acceptable and that differences in costs of prophylactic- and therapeutic-intensity dosing would be negligible.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — parenteral anticoagulation dosing is specified as follows: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) initial therapy uses loading dose 60 IU/kg (max 4000 IU) with initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (max 1000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) range of 60–80 s; to support percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients without prior anticoagulant therapy give 70–100 IU/kg with initial bolus to achieve target activated clotting time (ACT) of 250–300 s; with fibrinolytic therapy, use loading dose 60 IU/kg (maximum 4000 IU) with initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (maximum 1000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic aPTT range, with therapeutic aPTT range in setting of fibrinolytic therapy 50–70 s. Bivalirudin to support PCI is 0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per h IV infusion during the PCI procedure, with post-PCI infusion 1.75 mg/kg per h for 2–4 h post-PCI; in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min, reduced infusion to 1 mg/kg per h. Enoxaparin initial therapy is 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h, reduced to 1 mg/kg per d subcutaneous if CrCl < 30 mL/min; to support PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose was administered 8–12 h earlier or only 1 dose has been given, an IV dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be given, if the last dose was within 8 h no additional enoxaparin should be given, and for patients without prior anticoagulant therapy give 0.5–0.75 mg/kg IV bolus; with fibrinolytic therapy, if age ≤ 75 y give 30 mg IV bolus followed in 15 min by 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 100 mg for the first 2 doses), if age ≥ 75 y give no bolus and use 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 75 mg for the first 2 doses), and regardless of age, if CrCl < 30 mL/min give 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 24 h. Fondaparinux initial therapy is 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily; with fibrinolytic therapy give 2.5 mg IV then 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily starting the following day, contraindicated if CrCl < 30 mL/min, and fondaparinux should not be used to support PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

Regarding medical management for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to initiation of non-heparin anticoagulants, HIT with thrombosis, VKAs, ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend to do not initiate VKA until platelets have substantially recovered (usually to at least 150, 000/mcL). Start VKAs initially at low doses (maximum 5 mg of warfarin or 6 mg phenprocoumon) in patients with strongly suspected or confirmed HIT.

2.8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants

Heparin

Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium tablets, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium tablets therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium tablets has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.

As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium tablets should have INR monitoring at least:

5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin, or
4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or
24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.

Warfarin sodium tablets may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (> 50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.

Other Anticoagulants

Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to warfarin sodium tablets.

Randomisation and study drugs

We used web based central randomisation with a computer generated random sequence of variable block sizes stratified by site and age (≤ 65 v > 65 years) to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to therapeutic heparin or prophylactic heparin. Throughout the paper heparin refers to either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin — both forms of heparin are within the same drug class and exert their anticoagulant effect by amplifying the activity of the coagulation inhibitor antithrombin. They both also have similar non-anticoagulant effects. Patients allocated to therapeutic heparin received therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin as used for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Unfractionated heparin was administered using a weight based nomogram (bolus plus continuous infusion) with activated partial thromboplastin time or unfractionated heparin anti-Xa titration according to the centre specific protocols (that is, high dose nomogram). Patients allocated to prophylactic heparin received dose capped prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin) adjusted for body mass index and creatinine clearance (see supplementary file for dosing). Prophylactic doses of heparin were thus restricted to evidence based protocols for the prevention of venous thromboembolism for medical patients admitted to hospital. Study treatment was started within 24 hours after randomisation and continued until the first of hospital discharge, day 28, study withdrawal, or death (supplementary fig S1). If a participant was admitted to ICU, continuation of the allocated treatment was recommended.

Fibrinolytic and thrombolytic therapy — pharmacology and concurrent antithrombotic use indicate that the fibrinolytic system dissolves intravascular clots as a result of the action of plasmin, and patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy frequently receive IV heparin to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2 times normal and often an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin or clopidogrel.

Regarding medical management for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to initiation of non-heparin anticoagulants, HIT with thrombosis, VKAs, ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend to ensure overlapping VKAs with a non-heparin anticoagulant for a minimum of 5 days and until the INR is within the target range in patients with confirmed HIT, and reassess the INR after the anticoagulant effect of the non-heparin anticoagulant has resolved.

Heparin resistance — Defined as the situation wherein patients "require unusually high doses of heparin to achieve a therapeutic aPTT", it has mechanisms including "AT deficiency", "increased heparin clearance", "elevations in the levels of heparin-binding proteins", "high levels of factor VIII and/or fibrinogen", and drugs where "Aprotinin and nitroglycerin may cause drug-induced heparin resistance"; in VTE patients needing large doses "(> 35,000 units/d)", anti‑Xa–guided dosing with target "0.35–0.7 units/mL" produced similar outcomes and lower heparin doses than aPTT‑guided dosing, and "it is reasonable to adjust heparin doses based on anti-Xa levels in patients with VTE who require very high doses of heparin to achieve a therapeutic aPTT".

Factor Xa inhibitor laboratory assessment — preferred anti-FXa quantitation and PT/aPTT limitations: For apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, the preferred test for quantitation is a chromogenic anti-FXa assay calibrated with the drug of interest; anti-FXa assays may also be useful for betrixaban with method modification for sensitivity; when anti-FXa assays are calibrated with low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin standards, they can exclude clinically important levels but are not for quantitation; if anti-FXa is not available, PT may be useful qualitatively for betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, where a prolonged PT suggests on-therapy or above on-therapy levels but a normal PT may not exclude on-therapy levels; PT and aPTT are insensitive to apixaban, and a normal PT and aPTT do not exclude on-therapy or above on-therapy apixaban levels; whole-blood viscoelastic assays (TEG/ROTEM) show dose-dependent changes with DOACs, but thresholds adequate to guide reversal use have not been established.

Anticoagulation for pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves — key directives state that pregnant women with mechanical prostheses should receive therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent monitoring during pregnancy, and women unable to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent monitoring should be counseled against pregnancy. Women and their providers should use shared decision-making to choose an anticoagulation strategy for pregnancy, and women should be informed that VKA during pregnancy is associated with the lowest likelihood of maternal complications but the highest likelihood of miscarriage, fetal death, and congenital abnormalities, particularly if taken during the first trimester and if the warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/d. For planned delivery, those on warfarin should switch to twice-daily LMWH with a target anti–Xa level of 0.8 U/mL to 1.2 U/mL at 4 to 6 hours after dose or to intravenous UFH with an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 2 times control at least 1 week before planned delivery; patients on LMWH should switch to UFH with an aPTT 2 times control at least 36 hours before planned delivery, and UFH should be stopped at least 6 hours before planned vaginal delivery. If labor begins or urgent delivery is required while therapeutically anticoagulated with a VKA, cesarean section should be performed after reversal of anticoagulation. For women requiring a warfarin dose ≤ 5 mg/d to maintain a therapeutic INR, continuation of warfarin for all 3 trimesters is reasonable after discussion of risks and benefits; if dose requirements are > 5 mg/d, dose-adjusted LMWH with a target anti–Xa level of 0.8 to 1.2 U/mL at 4 to 6 hours after dose at least 2 times per day during the first trimester, followed by warfarin during the second and third trimesters, is reasonable. If dose-adjusted LMWH is unavailable for those requiring > 5 mg/d, dose-adjusted continuous intravenous UFH during the first trimester (with aPTT 2 times control), followed by warfarin for the second and third trimesters, is reasonable.
