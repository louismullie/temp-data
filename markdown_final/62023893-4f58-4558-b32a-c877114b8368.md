## Question

can you use chewable aspirin for pre-eclampsia prevention?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chewable aspirin can be used for preeclampsia prevention in pregnancy, and if so, how to dose and time it appropriately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indication and whether low-dose aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prevention. Then, I should verify the dose range and timing across major guidelines. Next, I will examine whether chewable tablets are pharmacologically equivalent to standard tablets and whether the formulation affects absorption or safety. After that, I need to check for any formulation-specific cautions in pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, sound recommendation with monitoring and counseling points anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the indication and the strength of evidence. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia in persons at increased risk, with consistent benefits on preeclampsia, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age infants, and perinatal mortality, and no significant increase in serious bleeding harms in randomized trials and meta-analyses, supporting a Grade B recommendation from the USPSTF and endorsement by ACOG/SMFM and AAFP [^1164CWcH] [^113BisK5] [^114txCLd] [^116Aag2n].

> I need to check the dose and timing next. Effective regimens generally use 60–150 mg daily, with most US guidance settling on 81 mg daily, and with emphasis on starting after 12 weeks' gestation and ideally before 16–20 weeks. Some international societies prefer 100–150 mg, and FIGO notes that two 81 mg tablets (total 162 mg) is an acceptable alternative, particularly when higher-dose benefit is desired or when 150 mg tablets are not available [^1164CWcH] [^114ersfL] [^112DdEso] [^113YPowT].

> Now, about chewables — wait, let me verify the formulation equivalence. Chewable aspirin contains the same active ingredient (acetylsalicylic acid) as standard tablets; the key difference is taste masking and excipients that facilitate chewing and rapid oral dissolution, which can speed onset of action but does not change the total dose delivered when the same milligram strength is used; there is no evidence that chewable formulations alter bioavailability in a way that would undermine preeclampsia prevention efficacy, and no guideline restricts formulation choice for this indication.

> Hold on, I should verify safety considerations unique to pregnancy. Low-dose aspirin in pregnancy is associated with small-to-moderate benefits and no significant increase in placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, or fetal intracranial bleeding in pooled analyses; rare bleeding events can occur, but overall safety is favorable when used as recommended, and this applies regardless of chewable versus non-chewable formulation since the systemic exposure is the same at a given dose [^1155U1UW] [^116Aag2n] [^1164CWcH].

> Let me consider practical administration details. If a patient prefers or finds chewables easier to take, a chewable 81 mg tablet taken whole or chewed and swallowed is acceptable. If a higher dose is desired (for example, 150–162 mg), two chewable 81 mg tablets can be used, which aligns with FIGO's allowance for two 81 mg tablets as an alternative to 150 mg, and with the general principle that total daily dose within the 60–150 mg range is effective when started early in the second trimester [^112DdEso] [^1164CWcH].

> But wait, what if the patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease or significant GI upset? I should confirm that chewables, which are designed for palatability and rapid dissolution, may be gentler for some patients; however, if there is active GI pathology or a history of aspirin hypersensitivity, that remains a contraindication regardless of formulation, and shared decision-making about risks and alternatives is warranted.

> I will now examine adherence and implementation, because effectiveness depends on consistent use. Qualitative evidence highlights barriers such as nausea, forgetfulness, and lack of clear counseling, and facilitators include simple instructions, trust in the clinician, and reminders; chewables may improve acceptability for some patients, which could indirectly support adherence, though the core requirement remains daily dosing from 12 weeks until delivery in those who meet risk criteria [^114n4LwQ] [^1164CWcH].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer. Yes, chewable aspirin can be used for preeclampsia prevention in pregnancy. Use the same evidence-based dosing (typically 81 mg daily, or 150–162 mg daily if higher-dose is preferred and available, initiated after 12 weeks and ideally before 16 weeks, continued until delivery) with the same risk-based eligibility criteria and safety counseling, since chewable and standard tablets are pharmacologically equivalent at the same dose and no guideline restricts formulation choice for this indication [^1164CWcH] [^112DdEso] [^111SeF1m].

> Finally, I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing beyond the evidence. The recommendation is for persons at increased risk of preeclampsia, not universal prophylaxis; while some advocate universal aspirin, current major guidelines endorse targeted use based on risk factors, and chewable versus non-chewable does not change that risk-stratified approach or the expected benefit–risk profile [^1164CWcH] [^111VHgHP] [^1114wmTv].

Chewable aspirin is **acceptable for preeclampsia prevention** if it delivers the correct low-dose (75–162 mg) and is taken as recommended. The key is to ensure the **correct dose and timing** (start at 12–16 weeks, continue until delivery) [^112pZit1] [^112DdEso]. Chewable tablets are pharmacologically equivalent to standard tablets and do not affect efficacy or safety when used correctly [^notfound]. Patients should be counseled to chew thoroughly and swallow to ensure full dose delivery [^notfound].

---

## Recommended dosage and timing

- **Dosage**: Low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention typically ranges from 75 mg to 162 mg daily [^112DdEso] [^114zVtuA]. Commonly used dosages include 75 mg, 81 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg, depending on regional availability and clinical guidelines [^112DdEso] [^114ersfL].

- **Timing**: Initiation of aspirin prophylaxis is recommended between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, and continued daily until delivery [^117GL9VL] [^113BisK5].

- **Chewable tablets**: Chewable aspirin tablets are pharmacologically equivalent to standard tablets, provided they contain the same active ingredient (acetylsalicylic acid) and are administered correctly [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting chewable aspirin use

There is **no direct evidence** specifically comparing chewable and standard aspirin tablets for preeclampsia prevention; however, the pharmacological equivalence of chewable and standard tablets supports the use of chewable aspirin if it delivers the correct dosage [^notfound]. The ASPRE trial, a landmark randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that **150 mg aspirin initiated before 16 weeks significantly reduced preterm preeclampsia** [^113wyt9v]. Although the trial did not specifically evaluate chewable tablets, its findings support the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin within the recommended dosage range [^112VZNmv].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Maternal safety**: Low-dose aspirin (75–162 mg daily) is generally considered safe during pregnancy, with no significant increase in maternal bleeding complications, placental abruption, or postpartum hemorrhage observed in clinical trials [^1155U1UW] [^116Aag2n].

- **Fetal safety**: No significant increase in fetal or neonatal adverse outcomes, including congenital anomalies, has been associated with low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^116Aag2n].

- **Chewable tablets**: Chewable aspirin tablets do not pose additional safety concerns compared to standard tablets when used at recommended dosages [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations and patient counseling

- **Patient preference**: Chewable tablets may be preferred by patients who have difficulty swallowing standard tablets, potentially improving adherence to therapy [^notfound].

- **Administration**: Patients should be instructed to chew the tablet thoroughly before swallowing to ensure complete absorption of the medication [^notfound].

- **Brand selection**: Patients should be advised to select chewable aspirin products that clearly indicate the dosage of acetylsalicylic acid per tablet to ensure accurate dosing [^notfound].

Background

Evidence has shown significant benefits of aspirin for preventing pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to systematically review recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and other recommendation documents on aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

Ten databases were searched for statements from December 1, 2013, to January 1, 2022.

Selection Criteria

Without language restrictions, the most recent version of documents was considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted recommendations. Guideline quality was assessed using a modified AGREE-II instrument and the AGREE-REX tool.

Main Results

Out of 48 statements on the prevention of pre-eclampsia, 46 had recommendations on use of aspirin. Of them, 39 were supported by evidence from systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials. Three statements reported aspirin's significant reductions in preterm pre-eclampsia and one in perinatal death. Concerning quality, 41% of statements were rated as high quality in all domains of the AGREE-II tool, 15% were rated high quality in all domains of the AGREE-REX tool, and 11% were rated high quality in all domains on both tools.

Conclusions

While 96% of statements advocated for use of aspirin, only 9% reported a significant reduction in preterm pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Based on the AGREE tools, future statements could use methodological improvement.

Aspirin: to reduce pre-eclampsia risk

Crandon and Isherwood's seminal 1979 paper documented the efficacy of prophylactic aspirin in reducing pre-eclampsia. Subsequent systematic reviews have synthesised large randomised controlled trials, examining the benefits, optimal timing, and dosage of aspirin given antenatally, as well as in target populations for prophylaxis.

A 2013 systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed reduced pre-eclampsia, perinatal death, and fetal growth restriction among individuals at high risk commenced on aspirin before 16 weeks. A subsequent 2017 systematic review of 45 randomised clinical trials identified increased benefits with more than 100 mg aspirin daily, without increasing adverse effects. A 2018 systematic reviewthat examined stillbirth prevention identified only one study of 24 patients who had had previous miscarriage, comparing 75 mg aspirin with placebo. This study found no benefit, and the findings were severely limited by its small size and homogenous population.

Few studies examining aspirin use in pregnancy are powered to detect stillbirth risk reduction. The ASPRE trialrandomly assigned 2971 participants at high risk of pre-eclampsia to 150 mg aspirin or placebo; the results suggested a possible lower rate of stillbirth and neonatal death among those receiving aspirin versus placebo (8 (1.0%) of 798 v 14 (1.7%) of 822, odds ratio 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.85)).

Risk stratification is undergoing debate, and international guidelines inconsistently describe target populations for prophylactic aspirin. A prospective, multicentre study compared a composite screen of maternal factors and objective investigations with current screening advised by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)guidelines, for which the results are shown in table 1. Both pre-eclampsia detection rates and false positive rates varied widely between guidelines. Given the relative safety of aspirin administration, an argument could be made for universal low dose aspirin in pregnancy.

Recent evidence suggests that aspirin might be much more effective than previously thought, with high compliance preceding 16 weeks; note, the effectiveness of aspirin on pre-eclampsia greatly reduced with decreasing compliance.

### Prevention of preeclampsia with aspirin [^113wyt9v]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension arising after 20 weeks of gestational age with proteinuria or other signs of end-organ damage and is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, particularly when of early onset. Although a significant amount of research has been dedicated in identifying preventive measures for preeclampsia, the incidence of the condition has been relatively unchanged in the last decades. This could be attributed to the fact that the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia is not entirely understood. There is increasing evidence suggesting that suboptimal trophoblastic invasion leads to an imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins, ultimately causing widespread inflammation and endothelial damage, increased platelet aggregation, and thrombotic events with placental infarcts. Aspirin at doses below 300 mg selectively and irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane and inhibiting inflammation and platelet aggregation. Such an effect has led to the hypothesis that aspirin could be useful for preventing preeclampsia. The first possible link between the use of aspirin and the prevention of preeclampsia was suggested by a case report published in 1978, followed by the first randomized controlled trial published in 1985. Since then, numerous randomized trials have been published, reporting the safety of the use of aspirin in pregnancy and the inconsistent effects of aspirin on the rates of preeclampsia. These inconsistencies, however, can be largely explained by a high degree of heterogeneity regarding the selection of trial participants, baseline risk of the included women, dosage of aspirin, gestational age of prophylaxis initiation, and preeclampsia definition. An individual patient data meta-analysis has indicated a modest 10% reduction in preeclampsia rates with the use of aspirin, but later meta-analyses of aggregate data have revealed a dose-response effect of aspirin on preeclampsia rates, which is maximized when the medication is initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age. Recently, the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial has revealed that aspirin at a daily dosage of 150 mg, initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age, and given at night to a high-risk population, identified by a combined first trimester screening test, reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62%. A secondary analysis of the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial data also indicated a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit by 68% compared with placebo, mainly because of a reduction in births before 32 weeks of gestational age with preeclampsia. The beneficial effect of aspirin has been found to be similar in subgroups according to different maternal characteristics, except for the presence of chronic hypertension, where no beneficial effect is evident. In addition, the effect size of aspirin has been found to be more pronounced in women with good compliance to treatment. In general, randomized trials are underpowered to investigate the treatment effect of aspirin on the rates of other placental-associated adverse outcomes such as fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. This article summarizes the evidence around aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications.

### Aspirin dosage for preeclampsia prophylaxis: an argument for 162-mg dosing [^116KqQjT]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal aspirin dose for preeclampsia prevention remains controversial, with international guidelines lacking consensus on the most effective regimen. Aspirin is a proven intervention for reducing the risk of preeclampsia, particularly when initiated early in pregnancy. Its benefits stem from the selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), reducing thromboxane A2 synthesis while preserving prostacyclin production, thereby restoring the vascular balance essential for placental health. A dose-response relationship has been established, with doses ≥ 100 mg showing significantly greater efficacy than lower doses. Furthermore, aspirin's pharmacological effects remain highly specific to COX-1 at the 162 mg dose, minimizing concerns about broader prostaglandin inhibition. Emerging evidence suggests that certain patient factors, such as altered pharmacokinetics during pregnancy or obesity, may reduce aspirin's effectiveness at lower doses (e.g., 81 mg). In these studies, aspirin resistance was successfully overcome with a 162 mg dose. While concerns regarding safety at this dose have been raised, contemporary randomized controlled trials utilizing a 150 mg dose have shown no increase in adverse effects compared to placebo. As such, current evidence increasingly supports 162 mg as the optimal dose for preeclampsia prevention, offering greater effectiveness than the commonly used 81 mg dose, without significant evidence of increased risk.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1122FNoA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: There is now good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) prevent pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their babies. A Cochrane Review identified moderate, but clinically important, reductions in the relative risks of pre-eclampsia (19%), preterm birth (7%) and perinatal mortality (16%) in women allocated antiplatelets, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, what dose of aspirin is best and when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start. Rather than undertake new trials, the best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from women enrolled in each trial. METHODS/DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis based on individual patient data. This involves the central collection, validation and re-analysis of thoroughly checked data from individual women in all the available randomised trials. The objective is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, will reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets delay the onset of pre-eclampsia or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile; when commenced during pregnancy; and/or by dose. DISCUSSION: The PARIS (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies) Collaboration has been formed to undertake the review. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Final results should be available by 2006–7.

### Molecular actions of heparin and their implications in preventing pre-eclampsia [^111hXSqC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, continues to be a significant cause of global maternal morbidity. Low-dose aspirin remains the only standard-of-care prophylactic therapy for preventing pre-eclampsia, but is limited in efficacy. Heparin and its derivatives may further enhance the efficacy of aspirin therapy to prevent pre-eclampsia, but the mechanisms mediating this augmentative effect are not known. Although heparin is an anticoagulant agent, it also possesses many anticoagulant-independent properties that may be relevant in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, including effects on placental, vascular and inflammatory function. This review summarizes the non-anticoagulant properties of heparin, and extrapolates how these actions may influence the trajectory of pre-eclampsia pathogenesis as a means of pathway-specific therapy.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117XKKzk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia is one of the most serious health problems that affect pregnant persons. It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia.

Population

Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy [^114ersfL]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to low-dose aspirin, general principles, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin (100–150 mg/day) from 12 weeks to 36–37 weeks of gestation in patients at high or moderate risk of preeclampsia.

### Prophylactic aspirin dose and preeclampsia [^116EyCmw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this large population-based study, we found no difference in either preeclampsia or bleeding complications when comparing 150 to 160 mg and 75 mg of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia. Large, randomized trials comparing aspirin doses must include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that any additional benefit of higher doses does not come at the risk of maternal bleeding.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^115avJVZ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis

Guideline 4.3.1

We recommend women with CKD are offered low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg) in pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (1B).

Guideline 4.3.2

We suggest kidney donors are offered low dose aspirin (75 mg–150 mg) to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (2D).

Rationale

Women with CKD have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared to women without CKD and should be offered pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin. This recommendation is generalised from high-quality evidence that low dose aspirin is associated with a reduced incidence of pre-eclampsia in other high-risk cohorts, although there is limited definitive evidence as to the optimal gestation and dose for women with CKD. A recent subgroup analysis of women with chronic hypertension from a randomised-controlled trial of 150 mg aspirin (150 mg) failed to show a reduction in the risk of subsequent pre-eclampsia, although these data are difficult to interpret in the absence of standardised diagnostic criteria for superimposed pre-eclampsia. Current national guidance recommends prescribing 75–150 mg of aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation onwards, but future research may elucidate optimisation of prophylaxis in women with CKD.

Women who have donated a kidney are at increased risk of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio 2.4; 95% confidence intervals 1.0–5.6). Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin should be discussed with these women, particularly in the presence of other known risk factors as outlined in national guidelines.

The benefit of calcium supplementation in reducing the prevalence of pre-eclampsia remains unclear. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed that supplementation of a least 1 g calcium per day was associated with a 55% reduction in pre-eclampsia, although the effect was mostly shown in smaller trials, with possible confounding by low dietary calcium intake. In contrast, large randomised controlled trials of calcium supplementation starting both before and after 20 weeks' gestation have failed to show a benefit in reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia. In the absence of evidence specific to women with CKD, and given the potential cardiovascular sequelae of a positive calcium balance in women with CKD, it was the consensus opinion of the guideline committee that calcium supplementation to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia cannot be recommended for women with CKD, based on current evidence.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^111phgQB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a common condition of pregnancy, marked by the onset of hypertension and proteinuria. At least 75 randomized controlled trials have shown that antiplatelet agents — especially aspirin — effectively and safely prevent pre-eclampsia among women at moderate or high risk of developing the condition. Meta-analyses have shown a 53% (95% confidence interval 35% to 66%) reduction in relative risk for pre-eclampsia when aspirin is started at 12–16 weeks' gestation among high risk women. Internationally published clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that physicians and midwives use aspirin to treat women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. These guidelines suggest choosing from a list of single risk factors to identify women at high risk or from a combination of moderate risk factors, but the derivation of this partial list was neither systematic nor based on clinical risk factors that are available up to 16 weeks' gestation. Focus on those at high risk of pre-eclampsia avoids the treatment of healthy women, who gain little or no benefit from aspirin prophylaxis.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112nr9EX]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF implementation — pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin, and those with 2 or more moderate-risk factors may also benefit, but the evidence is less certain for this approach; aspirin is available in the US as 81-mg tablets and low-dose aspirin use should be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation (studies most often initiated before 20 weeks of gestation); regarding the FDA warning about nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs around 20 weeks of gestation, an exception is the use of an 81-mg dose of aspirin for certain pregnancy-related conditions under the direction of a health care clinician.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116JKGsj]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps — aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia: There are several critical evidence gaps, including the need for research on how to improve identifying persons at increased risk for preeclampsia and for comparative effectiveness trials to identify the specific aspirin protocol likely to have the greatest benefit. Further research is needed in populations that have the highest rates of preeclampsia, including Black persons, and studies are needed to more fully understand the populations most likely to benefit and what risk thresholds and factors should be used to identify eligible patient populations. Research is also needed on aspirin effectiveness for all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and to improve effective and equitable implementation of clinical guidelines for aspirin use in pregnancy.

### Perceptions and experiences of the prevention, identification and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^114n4LwQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia

Prevention strategies include screening women to identify those at high risk of developing pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia and prescribing low‐dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or diet‐/exercise‐based measures. Calcium supplementation is also recommended for women with low dietary intake of calcium.

Primary qualitative studies have explored women's attitudes to risk screening, but no systematic review to date has synthesised this evidence. A qualitative evidence synthesis of six studies on adherence to low‐dose aspirin during pregnancy found a range of barriers to and facilitators of the initiation, implementation, and discontinuation of aspirin. All studies included in the review were from high‐income country settings, and barriers reported by women included insufficient knowledge and advice, feeling overwhelmed, lack of access to medication, feeling nauseous, and feeling tired. Facilitators included receiving consistent messaging and easy‐to‐understand information, trusting in the healthcare provider, believing in the concept of prevention, and developing strategies to remember to take the medication. The review focused on women's perspectives on adherence to aspirin but did not consider health worker or community perspectives.

A 2023 mixed‐methods systematic review of 16 studies (six of which included qualitative data) explored factors affecting the implementation of calcium supplementation for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia, finding a range of barriers and facilitators for women consuming calcium supplements and healthcare providers promoting calcium. Barriers to women taking calcium included limited knowledge about pre‐eclampsia, inadequate information about calcium, fear of adverse effects, and perceptions that taking calcium was inconvenient or over‐medicalising pregnancy. Facilitators for women taking calcium included improved knowledge through adequate information and counselling, assurance about safety, positive perception of tablet characteristics, and family support. While this review focused on women's and health workers' experiences with calcium supplementation, in practice calcium supplementation should be experienced within a comprehensive approach to pre‐eclampsia prevention, including education, screening, and aspirin prophylaxis if indicated. To date, no review has explored the package of related prevention activities in its entirety.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction [^112Xw6Gm]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

For the past decades, growing attention has been given to aspirin use during pregnancy. It favors placentation by its proangiogenic, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, low doses of aspirin are prescribed in the prevention of placenta-mediated complications, mainly preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, questions regarding its clinical application are still debated. Aspirin is effective in preventing preeclampsia in a high-risk population. Most guidelines recommend that risk stratification should rely on medical history. Nevertheless, screening performances dramatically improve if biochemical and biophysical markers are included. Concerning the appropriate timing and dose, latest studies suggest aspirin should be started before 16weeks of pregnancy and at a daily dose of 100mg or more. Further studies are needed to improve the identification of patients likely to benefit from prophylactic aspirin. Besides, the role of aspirin in the prevention of fetal growth restriction is still questioned.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1164CWcH]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — aspirin to prevent preeclampsia states that "The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation)". The target population is "Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin". The USPSTF "concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia". The burden of disease context on this page notes preeclampsia "is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US", and "accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US".

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112ALVNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical significance of pre-eclampsia

World-wide, over half a million women die each year of pregnancy related causes with 99% of these occurring in low resource countries. An estimated 10–15% of these maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

High blood pressure is common during pregnancy: approximately one in ten women will have their blood pressure recorded as above normal at some point before delivery. For women who develop raised blood pressure but have no other complications, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Pre-eclampsia, a multi-system disorder of pregnancy usually associated with high blood pressure (hypertension) and proteinuria, complicates 2–8% of pregnancies. It can affect the mother's organs, leading to problems in liver, kidneys and brain, and to abnormalities of the clotting system. As the placenta is also involved, there are increased risks for the baby. The most common problems are poor fetal growth due to inadequate blood supply through the damaged placenta, and prematurity, related either to the spontaneous onset of pre-term labour or the need for an early, elective delivery.

Although the outcome for most women is good, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (the rare occurrence of seizures superimposed on the syndrome of pre-eclampsia) are major causes of maternal mortality. In low resource countries pre-eclampsia and eclampsia account for 10–15% of maternal deaths whilst in high resource countries pre-eclampsia is consistently a leading cause of maternal mortality. Perinatal mortality is also increased. There is little good quality information about morbidity for either mother or baby, but it is likely that this too is high. For example, pre-eclampsia accounts for about one fifth of antenatal admissions, two thirds of referrals to day care assessment units and a quarter of obstetric admissions to intensive care units. Pre-eclampsia is an antecedent for up to 19% of pre-term births and 12% of growth restricted babies. Also of note is the high rate of intrauterine growth restriction (20–25%) in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and the possible lifelong health effects due to prenatal programming.

### Glycemic control and aspirin resistance in patients taking low-dose aspirin for pre-eclampsia prevention [^11292WFF]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the association between aspirin and glycemic control in diabetic, pregnant patients, and the risk for aspirin resistance in those with poor glycemic control across gestation taking low-dose aspirin (LDA) for pre-eclampsia (PEC) prevention.

Study Design

We performed a secondary analysis of samples collected during the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units trial of LDA for PEC prevention. A subset of insulin-controlled diabetic patient samples on placebo or 60mg aspirin daily were evaluated. Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured at randomization, mid-second trimester, and third trimester time points. Thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) measurements were previously assessed as part of the original study. Primary outcome was the effect of LDA on glycosylated hemoglobin levels compared with placebo across gestation.

Results

Levels of glycosylated hemoglobin increased across gestation in the placebo group (2,067.7 [interquartile range, IQR: 1,624.6–2,713.5 µg/mL] vs. 2,461.9 [1,767.0–3,209.9 µg/mL] vs. 3,244.3 [2,691.5–4,187.0 µg/mL]; p < 0.01) compared with no difference in levels of glycosylated hemoglobin across gestation in the LDA group (2,186.4 [IQR: 1,462.3–3,097.7 µg/mL] vs. 2,337.1 [1,327.7–5,932.6 µg/mL] vs. 2,532.9 [1,804.9–5,511.8 µg/mL]; p = 0.78). Higher levels of glycosylated hemoglobin were associated with increased TXB 2 levels prior to randomization (r = 0.67, p < 0.05). Incomplete TXB 2 was higher in pregnancies with increasing levels of glycosylated hemoglobin compared with those with decreasing levels of glycosylated hemoglobin across gestation (69.2 vs. 18.1%, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

LDA exposure may be beneficial to glycemic control in this patient population. Additionally, poor glycemic control is associated with a higher level of TXB 2 in diabetic pregnant patients on LDA. Higher doses of aspirin may be required in these patients to prevent development of PEC.

Key Points

· Low-dose aspirin may improve glycemic control. · Poor glycemic control increases risk for aspirin resistance. · Higher doses of aspirin may be required for pre-eclampsia prevention.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111VHgHP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical risk assessment for preeclampsia and aspirin — pregnant persons: For high-risk status, recommend low-dose aspirin if the patient has ≥ 1 high-risk factor such as history of preeclampsia with an adverse outcome, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, pregestational type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome), or combinations of multiple moderate-risk factors. For moderate risk, recommend low-dose aspirin if the patient has ≥ 2 moderate-risk factors, and consider low-dose aspirin if the patient has 1 of these moderate-risk factors including nulliparity, obesity with body mass index > 30, family history of preeclampsia, Black persons (due to social rather than biological factors), lower income, age 35 years or older, personal history factors (low birth weight or small for gestational age, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, > 10-year pregnancy interval), or in vitro conception. For low risk (prior uncomplicated term delivery and absence of risk factors), do not recommend low-dose aspirin.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^114cRKyK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

b. Patient-level characteristics

One of the strengths of individual patient data reviews is that it allows us to assess eligibility and outcome using individual women's characteristics. Subgroup analyses will explore whether any particular risk factors act as effect modifiers. That is, are there any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents? These analyses will take account each individual woman's own characteristics, rather than relying on summary measures of the 'average' risk profile of all participants in an individual trial.

Analyses will be undertaken to explore whether there are any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents based on the following criteria:

(i) risk factor profile for pre-eclampsia at trial entry

Women normotensive at trial entry:

- **Previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy**: previous early onset (≤ 33 weeks + 6 days gestation) pre-eclampsia or eclampsia / previous pre-eclampsia / previous gestational hypertension / no previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy but family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy and no family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

- **Diabetes**: pre-existing diabetes at enrolment / no pre-existing diabetes at enrolment

- **Renal disease**: pre-existing renal disease / no pre-existing renal disease

- **Autoimmune disease**: autoimmune disease / no autoimmune disease

- **Multiple pregnancy**: multiple pregnancy / singleton pregnancy

- **Maternal age**: < 20 years / 20–35 years / > 35 years. Maternal age may also be analysed as a continuous variable.

- **Diagnostic test results**: abnormal uterine artery Doppler scan / other diagnostic test abnormalities / no abnormal diagnostic test results

- **previous SGA**: previous small for gestational age infant / previous infant not small for gestational age / no previous infant

- **Primigravida**: first pregnancy with no other risk factors / first pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with no risk factors

Women with hypertension at trial entry:

- **Hypertension**: gestational hypertension / chronic hypertension

(ii) gestation at trial entry

To determine whether antiplatelet agents are differentially effective if given earlier in pregnancy and to determine the magnitude of any difference, gestational age at randomisation will be primarily analysed as a continuous variable in regression analyses. However, a subgroup analysis with women classified according to the following categories may also be performed: < 16 weeks, 16–19 completed weeks, 20–23 completed weeks, 24–27 completed weeks, ≥ 28 weeks gestation. If numbers are insufficient for any category, categories will be combined.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114xStQD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy — preeclampsia and perinatal outcomes — shows that daily low-dose aspirin taken after 12 weeks' gestation significantly reduced preeclampsia risk in moderate- or high-risk individuals versus placebo (pooled relative risk: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.95]). Aspirin use was also associated with significantly reduced risk for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia without increases in risk of postpartum hemorrhage, and only individuals with no prior adverse events or allergy to aspirin should be advised to take low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114KW4HH]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment for identifying aspirin candidates — Pregnant persons are at high risk for preeclampsia if they have 1 or more of the following risk factors: history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, pregestational type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, or autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome). Combinations of multiple moderate-risk factors may also be used (e.g., nulliparity, obesity, family history of preeclampsia, maternal age 35 years or older, personal history factors including a > 10-year pregnancy interval, in vitro fertilization conception, and lower income). Black persons are associated with increased risk due to environmental, social, and structural inequities, not biological propensities. Pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin, and those with moderate-risk factors may also benefit.

### Comparing aspirin 75 to 81 mg vs 150 to 162 mg for prevention of preterm preeclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VZNmv]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare 2 aspirin dosage regimens for the prevention of preterm preeclampsia (PE): 75 to 81 mg vs 150 to 162 mg taken daily starting in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Data Sources

A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1985 to April 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of 2 aspirin dosage regimens during pregnancy for the prevention of PE initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy. The intervention was an aspirin dosage between 150 and 162 mg daily, and the control was an aspirin dosage between 75 and 81 mg daily.

Methods

Of note, 2 reviewers independently screened all citations, selected studies, and evaluated the risk of bias. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and applied the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The corresponding authors of the included studies were contacted to validate each of the collected results. The primary outcome was the risk of preterm preeclampsia, and the secondary outcomes included term preeclampsia, any preeclampsia regardless of gestational age, and severe preeclampsia. Relative risks with their 95% confidence interval were calculated for each study and pooled for global analysis.

Results

Of note, 4 randomized controlled trials were retrieved involving 552 participants. Moreover, 2 randomized controlled trials were at unclear risk of bias, 1 trial at low risk of bias and 1 trial at high risk of bias, which did not have the information for the primary outcome. The pooled analysis demonstrated that an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg was associated with a significant reduction of preterm preeclampsia, compared with an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.79; p = 0.01; I² = 0%). There was no significant effect on the risk of term preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–2.64; p = 0.48; I² = 64%) and all preeclampsia (4 studies; 552 participants; relative risk, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–1.05; p = 0.06; I² = 58%), but there was a reduction of severe preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participantst; RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09–0.62; p = 0.003; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

When initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy, an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg daily was associated with a lower risk of preterm PE than an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg daily. However, the lack of large, high-quality studies limited the clinical scope of the current results taken alone.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^116JPHH5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Planned analyses

This section contains a summary of the planned analyses. The full, detailed analysis plan will be discussed and agreed upon by the Collaborators before any data have been analysed.

Analysis will aim to be of all women ever randomised and will be based on intention to treat. In the main analyses a two stage approach will be taken. Outcomes will be analysed in their original trial and then these separate results will be combined to give an overall measure of effect. A fixed effect model will be used and the assumption of homogeneity of treatment effects will be tested using the chi squared test. The I 2 statistic will also be used to assess consistency of results.

1. Outcomes to be analysed

The main analyses comparing the effect of antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agents will be undertaken for all outcomes listed below, for the woman and any fetus/baby. The planned sub-group and sensitivity analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes listed as follows:

a. Main outcomes

- pre-eclampsia

- pregnancy loss / neonatal death

- pre-term birth

- small for gestational age infant

- pregnancy with serious adverse outcome

b. Other outcomes

- early onset pre-eclampsia

- maternal death

- severe maternal morbidity

- antepartum haemorrhage

- placental abruption

- induction of labour

- Caesarean section delivery

- postpartum haemorrhage

- gestation at delivery

- infant admission to special care or neonatal intensive care unit

- infant required assisted ventilation

- neonatal bleeding

- infant death

2. Planned sub-group analyses

The planned sub-group analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes unless there are clear indications for expanding the analyses further.

a. Trial-level characteristics

The effect of antiplatelet therapy may vary across the trials in the meta-analysis because they have used different agents in different ways. To explore this further, analyses are planned whereby trials will be grouped according to the agent used and by dose. These analyses will focus on the main outcomes. Trials will be classified into subsets based on the following:

(i) type of antiplatelet(s)

Trials will be grouped by the type of antiplatelet agent (trials that used aspirin alone, trials that used other antiplatelet agents, trials that used both aspirin and other antiplatelets agents) given as the active treatment.

(ii) daily dose of aspirin

In trials that used aspirin alone, trials will be grouped by planned aspirin dose (< 75 mg, 75–149 mg, ≥ 150 mg).

### Low-dose aspirin for prevention of morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^116vo8Fy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To systematically review benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin for preventing morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2006 to June 2013); previous systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and surveillance searches for large studies (June 2013 to February 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to assess benefits among women at high preeclampsia risk and RCTs or large cohort studies of harms among women at any risk level. English-language studies of fair or good quality were included.

Data Extraction

Dual quality assessment and abstraction of studies.

Data Synthesis

Two large, multisite RCTs and 13 smaller RCTs of high-risk women (8 good-quality) were included, in addition to 6 RCTs and 2 observational studies of average-risk women to assess harms (7 good-quality). Depending on baseline risk, aspirin use was associated with absolute risk reductions of 2% to 5% for preeclampsia (relative risk [RR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95]), 1% to 5% for intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.65 to 0.99]), and 2% to 4% for preterm birth (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). No significant perinatal or maternal harms were identified, but rare harms could not be ruled out. Evidence on long-term outcomes was sparse, but 18-month follow-up from the largest trial found no developmental harms.

Limitations

Benefits may have been overestimated due to small-study effects. Predictive intervals were not statistically significant. Future studies could shift findings toward the null.

Conclusion

Daily low-dose aspirin beginning as early as the second trimester prevented clinically important health outcomes. No harms were identified, but long-term evidence was limited.

### Aspirin dosage for preeclampsia prophylaxis: an argument for 81-mg dosing [^1118MtL5]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Research conducted over the past few decades has shown that low-dose aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia. Consequently, numerous prominent organizations have adopted the recommendation to use low-dose aspirin during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia. However, the optimal dosage of low-dose aspirin (81mg versus 162mg) remains a subject of debate. Currently, there is insufficient high-quality data to justify the use of a higher dosage of low-dose aspirin. In this review, we review the existing evidence that supports the continued use of 81mg of aspirin over a higher dose and emphasize the need for high-quality research to alter current recommendations.

In pregnant individuals with risk factors for preeclampsia, prophylactic low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia. Fifteen distinct risk factors are recognized, including elements of current and past medical and obstetrical history, family history, and examination findings. We present checklists intended to reduce the chance that risk factors might be inadvertently overlooked and to improve the probability of aspirin being recommended for all appropriate candidates. We also suggest how such a checklist can be implemented into practice.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^1118bBwb]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of mortality and morbidity during pregnancy and childbirth. Antiplatelet agents, especially low-dose aspirin, might prevent or delay pre-eclampsia, and thereby improve outcome. Our aim was to assess the use of antiplatelet agents for the primary prevention of pre-eclampsia, and to explore which women are likely to benefit most.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 32,217 women, and their 32,819 babies, recruited to 31 randomised trials of pre-eclampsia primary prevention.

Findings

For women assigned to receive antiplatelet agents rather than control, the relative risk of developing pre-eclampsia was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.97), of delivering before 34 weeks was 0.90 (0.83–0.98), and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome was 0.90 (0.85–0.96). Antiplatelet agents had no significant effect on the risk of death of the fetus or baby, having a small for gestational age infant, or bleeding events for either the women or their babies. No particular subgroup of women was substantially more or less likely to benefit from antiplatelet agents than any other.

Interpretation

Antiplatelet agents during pregnancy are associated with moderate but consistent reductions in the relative risk of pre-eclampsia, of birth before 34 weeks' gestation, and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and… [^115Kn55a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. See the Summary of Recommendation figure. In the 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF recommended the use of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia. 14 The current recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation. It is strengthened by new evidence from additional trials supporting reduced risks of perinatal mortality with low-dose aspirin use.

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review1, 15 to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia. The current review included evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in pregnant persons at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as assessing the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy. USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin use in individuals at increased risk. Maternal complications of preeclampsia rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine19 recommend low-dose aspirin prophylaxis for persons at high risk of preeclampsia; the regimen should be initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation and continued daily until delivery. 1 Additionally, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for individuals with more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia.

### Pre-eclampsia in low and middle-income settings: what are the barriers to improving perinatal outcomes and evidence-based recommendations? [^111Jz7yX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss the points that still challenge low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and strategies that have been studied to help them overcome these issues.

Methods

Narrative review addressing 20years of articles concerning pre-eclampsia morbidity and mortality in LMICs. We summarized evidence-based strategies to overcome the challenges in order to reduce the pre-eclampsia impact on perinatal outcomes.

Results

Pre-eclampsia is the first or second leading cause in the ranking of avoidable causes of maternal death, and approximately 16% of all maternal deaths are attributable to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Considering the social and economic contexts, it represents a major public health concern, and prevention and early detection of pre-eclampsia seem to be a major challenge. Reducing maternal mortality related to hypertensive disturbances depends on public policies to manage these preventable conditions. Early and continuous recognition of signs of severity related to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and childbirth, self-monitoring of symptoms and blood pressure, as well as preventive approaches such as aspirin and calcium, and magnesium sulfate, are lifesaving procedures that have not yet reached a universal scale.

Conclusion

This review provides a vision of relevant points to support pregnant women in overcoming the constraints to healthcare access in LMICs, and strategies that can be applied in primary prenatal care units.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^117GL9VL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued the Hypertension in Pregnancy Task Force Report recommending daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published a similar guideline, although the list of indications for low-dose aspirin use was more expansive. Daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline criteria for prevention of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.

### Should we recommend universal aspirin for all pregnant women? [^111Tdk33]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in at-risk populations. Its role in low-risk populations is as yet unknown. Novel preeclampsia screening tests are emerging that can predict the risk of the development of preeclampsia from as early as 11 weeks of gestation. It may be more efficacious, acceptable, and cost-effective to prescribe low-dose aspirin to all pregnant women from the first trimester as opposed to performing a screening test in the first instance. There is variation in opinion: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests the use of aspirin only in women who are at risk of preeclampsia, based on patient history; the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, UK, and the US Preventative Services Task Force recommend the use of low-dose aspirin if there is 1 major or 2 moderate risk factors. This point-counterpoint discussion shall address (1) controversies regarding the real impact of low-dose aspirin; (2) controversies in the actual guidelines among the different national societies; (3) controversies regarding emerging preeclampsia screening tests in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy, and (4) points in favor of the provision of universal vs screened-positive women.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia [^1143HNZ9]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia remains one of the major obstetrical problems in less-developed countries. The causes of this condition are still unknown, thus effective primary prevention is not possible at this stage. Research in the past decade has identified some major risk factors for pre-eclampsia, and manipulation of these factors might result in a decrease in its frequency. In the early 1990s aspirin was thought to be the wonder drug in secondary prevention of pre-eclampsia. Results of large trials have shown that this is not the case: if there is an indication for using aspirin it is in the patient at a very high risk of developing severe early-onset disease. The calcium story followed a more or less similar pattern, with the difference that existing evidence shows that women with a low dietary calcium intake are likely to benefit from calcium supplementation. Proper antenatal care and timed delivery are of utmost importance in tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia. There is evidence to suggest that the intrinsic direct effect of moderate degrees of maternal hypertension is beneficial to the fetus. Severe hypertension needs treatment. If antihypertensive is indicated, there is no clear choice of a drug. Hydralazine should no longer be thought of as the primary drug, most studies show a preference for calcium channel blockers.

Regarding preventative measures for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to low-dose aspirin (advanced age pregnancy), ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate daily low-dose aspirin for the reduction of preeclampsia in pregnant patients aged ≥ 35 years in the setting of at least one other moderate risk factor.

### Findings and research gaps… [^111gF3nG]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on its review of the available evidence, the task force recommends the use of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks' gestation in people who are at high risk for preeclampsia. This is a grade "B" recommendation, and applies to asymptomatic pregnant patients who are at high risk for preeclampsia and who have had no prior adverse events with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin. "Fortunately, clinicians can help high-risk pregnant people and their babies stay healthy through daily low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia, " task force member Aaron Caughey, M. D. M. P. P. M. P. H. Ph. D., said in a press release. "It's important for clinicians to take into account a number of health factors that increase preeclampsia risk when determining whether to recommend low-dose aspirin".

The final recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's September 2014 recommendation on the topic, which also recommended low-dose aspirin as a preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women at high risk for preeclampsia. The AAFP supported the 2014 recommendation. To update the existing recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia. The review consisted of relevant studies published between January 2013 and May 15, 2020, and included evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in pregnant patients at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes. Evidence suggested that low-dose aspirin use was effective in reducing the risks of a number of adverse health outcomes.

A pooled relative risk analysis of results from several trials found that in individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia, low-dose aspirin use reduced the risks of preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal mortality and fetal intracranial bleeding. In addition, analysis of the trial results did not show evidence of harms from daily low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy. Bleeding harms were uncommon, and pooled results were not statistically significant for placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding. The task force also did not find a difference in harms based on aspirin dosage, timing of aspirin initiation or for specific populations based on limited subgroup comparisons.

### A randomized crossover design study comparing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 2 single doses of oral aspirin (75 mg V 150 mg) in pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia: implications on assessing aspirin response and patient adherence to therapy [^117ARC29]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy is associated with physiological changes that can alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of many drugs. Low-dose aspirin is used for preeclampsia prevention; however, aspirin's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are poorly studied in pregnant women.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamics of 2 common doses of aspirin (75 and 150 mg) used for preeclampsia prevention in high-risk women by examining their effect on thromboxane B 2 inhibition. A secondary objective sought to assess if salicylic acid could be used as means to evaluate adherence to aspirin.

Study Design

Fourteen pregnant women from a large maternity unit in England, eligible for prophylactic aspirin according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, were recruited into 2×2 randomized crossover trial. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 hours postingestion of either 75 or 150 mg of aspirin with a 7-day washout period. Plasma concentrations of salicylic acid, the primary metabolite of aspirin, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacodynamic response to aspirin was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B 2 concentrations by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyte data were compared using nonparametric test statistics for paired values (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) and areas under serum SA concentration versus time curve. Pharmacokinetic modeling was used to bridge the data arising from the overnight sampling break.

Results

A single dose of 150 mg of aspirin produced higher plasma exposure of SA in comparison to 75 mg (median SA areas under serum SA concentration vs time curve 0–19 16.7 μg∗h/ml [interquartile range 15.2–19.3] vs 6.8 μg∗h/ml [interquartile range 6.1–8.3], P < .001). Pharmacokinetic models suggest that plasma SA concentrations could be detected above the maximum concentration recorded at baseline for the first 11 hours after 75 mg and for 12 hours after 150-mg aspirin dosing, providing a time frame to confirm recent aspirin ingestion. The 150-mg aspirin dose produced a greater normalized reduction in serum thromboxane B 2 (median normalized reduction 95.7% [interquartile range 92.6%-97.3%] than the 75-mg dose median normalized reduction 84.6% [interquartile range 77.3%-92.3%], P < .007).

Conclusion

Compared to the 75-mg dose, 150 mg of aspirin more effectively inhibits thromboxane B 2, providing rationale for further investigation of effectiveness of higher doses for preeclampsia prevention. Despite limitations, measuring serum SA concentration could still be used in future models to test adherence if done within 11 to 12 hours after ingestion.

### Effect of current guidelines on prevention of pre-eclampsia with low-dose aspirin in primary settings: a population-based case-control study [^1176Fy1k]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin, which was administered at or before the 16th week of pregnancy due to maternal characteristics and history of a pre-existing medical condition, on prevention of pre-eclampsia, and on the birth of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate without pre-eclampsia in nulliparas in primary settings.

Methods

We performed a case-control study using population-based data on 47 271 nulliparas with a singleton pregnancy who delivered in Slovenia from 2013 to 2017. The treated group received low-dose aspirin. For the untreated group, propensity score matching was used to perform a 1:1 matching. In the matched sample, we calculated the odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) with a two-way test for pre-eclampsia, as well as SGA neonates.

Results

In the treated group (n = 584), the odds for an SGA neonate were significantly increased by 42.7% (OR 1.427, 95% CI 1.001–2.034). However, we found no significant effect on the odds for pre-eclampsia (OR 1.308, 95% CI 0.847–2.022).

Conclusions

In anticipation of more substantial population-based data studies, in the Slovenian population, preventive treatment with low-dose aspirin due to maternal characteristics and history of a pre-existing medical condition is not beneficial for the prevention of pre-eclampsia and can harm fetal growth.

### Early administration of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of severe and mild preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RyWaw]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early administration of aspirin prevents severe and mild preeclampsia.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Studies in which women were randomized at or before 16 weeks' gestation to low-dose aspirin versus placebo or no treatment were included. The outcomes of interest were severe preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia. Pooled relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Among 7941 citations retrieved, 352 were completely reviewed and four studies (392 women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. When compared with controls, aspirin started at ≤ 16 weeks was associated with a significant reduction in severe (relative risk: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.57) but not mild (relative risk: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.96) preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin initiated at or before 16 weeks reduces the risk of severe preeclampsia, but not mild preeclampsia.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^115RLehN]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Interpretation

By quantifying the risk of pre-eclampsia conferred by various individual clinical risk factors, a clinician could be better equipped to estimate a woman's risk of pre-eclampsia and her candidacy for heightened surveillance or prophylactic measures, including aspirin. Additionally, our findings could enhance the choice and weighting of first trimester clinical factors in future clinical prediction models for pre-eclampsia.

At a population health level, the population attributable fractions we calculated suggest different priority of risk factors for pre-eclampsia, only some of which are modifiable (fig 3). For example, nulliparity is not reversible, while prepregnancy obesity is. Moreover, as obesity is closely linked to chronic hypertension, a reduction in prepregnancy BMI could reduce both of these important risk factors for pre-eclampsia. Certainly, in women with non-modifiable risk factors, such as a prior history of pre-eclampsia, one could consider alternative strategies. The example we used was aspirin prophylaxis, which has been shown to efficaciously and safely reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in high risk women. Some risk factors — antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, chronic hypertension, prior pre-eclampsia, pregestational diabetes mellitus, prepregnancy BMI > 30, and assisted reproductive technology — were each found to be associated with a high rate of pre-eclampsia and a low threshold number needed to prevent (NNP T), which would justify consideration for aspirin (fig 4). Outside of pregnancy, for example, 420 adult women need to be treated with aspirin over five years to prevent one cardiovascular event. We adopted a much more conservative approach, setting the NNP T at 250, knowing that women need to take aspirin for only 25 weeks to prevent a single case of pre-eclampsia. It is on this basis that certain risk factors, either alone or in combination, might be enough to label a woman as being at "high risk" for pre-eclampsia. For others, we either lacked confidence about their role as a distinct risk factor for pre-eclampsia, or they simply surpassed NNP T of 250. Notwithstanding, we believe that all of the risk factors we studied should be evaluated within a multivariable model examining the risk of pre-eclampsia, with various combinations of risk factors. For prior intrauterine growth restriction, itself a heterogeneous state, its role as a risk factor for pre-eclampsia remains to be determined with a standard and specific definition.

### Obstetric care provider's knowledge about the use of low dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention in low and middle income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144b7TA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia can elevate the likelihood of unfavorable consequences for a mother, such as early abruption of placenta, renal dysfunction, hepatic failure, cerebrovascular accident, HELLP syndrome, and the need for intensive care unit admission. Additionally, it can present risks for the infant, which may include fetal or neonatal mortality and the need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, preeclampsia may lead to an increased reliance on additional medical interventions and hospitalization. The onset of preeclampsia is associated with compromised placental development in the early stages of pregnancy, a condition attributed to increased levels of circulating anti-angiogenic factors like soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase. Moreover, there is impaired immunological tolerance between maternal, paternal (placental), and fetal tissues, coupled with maternal maladjustment to the cardiovascular or inflammatory alterations typically observed during a typical pregnancy.

The suggested mechanism of action for aspirin in preventing preeclampsia involves: inhibiting platelet aggregation and exerting its antithrombotic effect. This, in turn, results in a reduced level of placental infarction. Additionally, it enhances healthy placental development and growth, while also exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects and promoting endothelial stabilization. A recent meta-analysis involving data from 45 randomized trials revealed noteworthy decreases in severe preeclampsia. The relative risk was found to be 0.47 when low-dose aspirin was initiated prior to the 16th week of pregnancy. Administering low-dose aspirin to women with a high risk of preterm preeclampsia led to a reduced occurrence of this condition compared to a placebo.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin 81 mg) in a daily basis as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends low dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin, 75 mg per day) for the prevention of preeclampsia in women at moderate or high risk of developing the condition. American college of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends low dose aspirin (81 mg) on a daily basis and optimally initiated at 16 weeks of gestation in women with more than one moderate risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age greater than 40, body mass index of greater than 35, family history of preeclampsia and multiple pregnancy) and women with one or more high risk factors (hypertension in the previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes and chronic hypertension).

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113P2LWV]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF assessment of net benefit of low-dose aspirin — pregnant persons at risk for preeclampsia: There is adequate evidence of a reduction in risk for preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction (SGA/IUGR), and perinatal mortality in persons at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin, and adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin reduces risk for preeclampsia; the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, SGA/IUGR, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112ZrkPM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the types of study designs, participants, interventions and data completeness to be included in the review are listed below. Each potentially eligible study will be assessed independently by two members of the Secretariat, unblinded to the trial's identity. Any differences of opinion regarding the assessment of the inclusion criteria will be resolved by discussion between the two assessors. If differences cannot be resolved, a third member of the Secretariat will be asked to assess the study. If individual patient data are unavailable from an eligible trial, the trial will remain included in the review and aggregate data will be used.

a. Study design

Studies will be included in the review if they were randomised trials. Quasi-random study designs, such as those using alternate allocation, will be excluded. The level of allocation concealment within each trial will be assessed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook, and classified as either adequate, unclear or clearly inadequate. These assessments will be made together with the outcomes of thorough data checking procedures.

b. Participants

Participants will be pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Women who started treatment postpartum will be excluded, as will those who already have a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia at trial entry (defined as hypertension with new onset proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation, not due to renal disease).

c. Interventions

The interventions will be any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole), or any combination of antiplatelet agents, compared with placebo or no antiplatelet agent. This is regardless of dose, mode of administration and irrespective of whether the antiplatelet is in combination with another drug. Trials that assessed only physiological outcomes following a short duration of intended therapy will be excluded.

d. Completeness of follow-up

The main analyses will include all trials that fulfill the previous inclusion criteria, regardless of completeness of follow-up. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the effect of the inclusion of data from trials where only small numbers of enrolled participants have available outcome data. The threshold for an acceptable level of data completeness may vary by outcome. For example, for long-term follow-up of women and children, data may be included if follow-up was less than 80% provided that substantive bias between the groups was unlikely. Other outcomes from each trial may only be included in the analysis if available for 80% or more of women.

### Aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia: the conundrum of how, who and when [^114rmG6w]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is widely used in preventing early onset preeclampsia in women who are identified as being high risk. Although the benefit of aspirin is increasingly evident and acknowledged, there remains many unanswered questions with regards to its optimal application in pregnancy. The issues mainly centre around the relatively modest risk reduction that is observed with the use of aspirin prophylactically. We aim to explore the reasons behind the conservative rate of benefit and aim to explore factors that are likely to influence the outcomes with the use of aspirin.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^116Aag2n]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that poses serious maternal and infant health risks. Previous systematic reviews have established benefits of low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia and its sequelae.

Objective

To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on effectiveness of aspirin use in preventing preeclampsia in individuals at increased risk based on clinical risk factors or measurements associated with higher disease incidence than in the general population.

Data Sources

Studies from previous USPSTF review (2014), literature published January 2013 through May 15, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed (for publisher-supplied records only), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Ongoing surveillance through January 22, 2021.

Study Selection

Good- and fair-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia among individuals at increased risk; studies conducted in general populations to evaluate potential harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual article screening and risk-of-bias assessment. Study data abstracted into prespecified forms, checked for accuracy. Random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnosis of preeclampsia; adverse pregnancy health outcomes and complications including eclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and potential bleeding harms or infant/child harms from aspirin exposure.

Results

A total of 23 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 26 952) were included; 18 were conducted among participants at increased preeclampsia risk. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 mg/d to 150 mg/d. Most trials enrolled majority White populations selected based on a range of risk factors. The incidence of preeclampsia among the trials of participants at increased risk ranged from 4% to 30%. Aspirin use was significantly associated with lower risk of preeclampsia (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.95]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 093]; I2 = 0%), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.96]; 11 RCTs [n = 13 860]; I2 = 0%), preterm birth (pooled RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67–0.95]; 13 RCTs [n = 13 619]; I2 = 49%), and intrauterine growth restriction (pooled RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 385]; I2 = 41%). There were no significant associations of aspirin use with risk of postpartum hemorrhage (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.94–1.12]; 9 RCTs [n = 23 133]; I2 = 0%) and other bleeding-related harms, or with rare perinatal or longer-term harms. Absolute risk reductions for preeclampsia associated with aspirin use ranged from -1% to -6% across larger trials (n > 300) and were greater in smaller trials. For perinatal mortality, absolute risk reductions ranged from 0.5% to 1.1% in the 3 largest trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Daily low-dose aspirin during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of serious perinatal outcomes for individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia, without evident harms.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^1166jKsS]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The main goal of our meta-analysis was to identify those clinical risk factors that serve as potential determinants of pre-eclampsia. Schnohr and colleagues used a similar approach in ranking the top 10 risk factors for coronary heart disease. They found that their prioritization of risk factors differed at the individual patient level (based on the relative risk) from that at the population level (based on the population attributable fraction). This dual approach is attractive, as a woman with a rare risk factor like antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is certainly at high risk of pre-eclampsia in the presence of that risk factor (fig 2), even though the rarity of that risk factor makes it less of a consideration in the reduction of risk of pre-eclampsia within the entire population (fig 3). Moreover, they used a multivariable approach in their analysis of risk factors for coronary heart disease, something to be considered in the comparison of the influence of risk factors for pre-eclampsia.

Conclusion

We identified the extent to which various clinical risk factors in early pregnancy heighten a woman's absolute and relative risk for pre-eclampsia. Some of the major risk factors evaluated produced event rates that were either similar to, or lower than, the rates seen in randomized controlled trials of aspirin prophylaxis among women at risk of pre-eclampsia(appendix 5). Accordingly, evaluation of whether the efficacy (that is, relative risk reduction) of aspirin prophylaxis differs across risk factors can clarify whether they are equally responsive to that intervention, or others. Additionally, evaluation of the effectiveness of aspirin in the prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia and severe forms of pre-eclampsia, by individual risk factors and their combination, is needed. Separately, there is evidence that clinical decisions are viewed differently by a woman and her healthcare provider, as is their perception of risk. Thus, data should be obtained from the woman and practitioner on the threshold number needed to prevent at which they are comfortable initiating aspirin prophylaxis.

### Prophylactic aspirin dose and preeclampsia [^1149yXuU]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Research Implications

Ideally, large, randomized trials comparing different doses should be done to validate our conclusions. Any large trials examining different doses should include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that the risk-benefit ratio can be examined. Trials should include low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage is greatest. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded a large trialin low and middle income country settings comparing 75 and 150 mg of aspirin, including both preeclampsia and hemorrhage outcomes. In addition, a US-based studywas recently funded and plans to investigate the effects of different doses in a population of 10 000 women at increased risk of preeclampsia. Together with our study that included almost 14 000 women, the results from these trials will hopefully provide robust evidence on the appropriate aspirin dosage for preventing preeclampsia.

### Pre-eclampsia [^111RsftR]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem pregnancy disorder characterised by variable degrees of placental malperfusion, with release of soluble factors into the circulation. These factors cause maternal vascular endothelial injury, which leads to hypertension and multi-organ injury. The placental disease can cause fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Prophylactic low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of preterm pre-eclampsia, but once pre-eclampsia has been diagnosed there are no curative treatments except for delivery, and no drugs have been shown to influence disease progression. Timing of delivery is planned to optimise fetal and maternal outcomes. Clinical trials have reported diagnostic and prognostic strategies that could improve fetal and maternal outcomes and have evaluated the optimal timing of birth in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. Ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy, dose, and timing of aspirin and calcium to prevent pre-eclampsia and are evaluating other drugs to control hypertension or ameliorate disease progression.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^116Ch419]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is now good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) prevent pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their babies. A Cochrane Review identified moderate, but clinically important, reductions in the relative risks of pre-eclampsia (19%), preterm birth (7%) and perinatal mortality (16%) in women allocated antiplatelets, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet.

Uncertainty remains, however, about whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, what dose of aspirin is best and when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start. Rather than undertake new trials, the best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from women enrolled in each trial.

Methods/Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis based on individual patient data. This involves the central collection, validation and re-analysis of thoroughly checked data from individual women in all the available randomised trials.

The objective is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, will reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets delay the onset of pre-eclampsia or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile; when commenced during pregnancy; and/or by dose.

Discussion

The PARIS (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies) Collaboration has been formed to undertake the review. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Final results should be available by 2006–7.

### Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^113abhPi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), EMBASE (1994 to 2003) and we handsearched the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi-random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We entered data into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Fifty-one trials involving 36,500 women are included in this review. There is a 19% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((43 trials, 33,439 women; relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.88); number needed to treat (NNT) 69 (51, 109)). Twenty-eight trials (31,845 women) reported preterm birth. There is a small (7%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks ((RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98); NNT 83 (50, 238)). Fetal or neonatal deaths were reported in 38 trials (34,010 women). Overall there is a 16% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96); NNT 227 (128, 909)). Small-for-gestational age babies were reported in 32 trials (24,310 women), with an 8% reduction in risk (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low-dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment is best started, and at what dose.

We updated the search in September 2019 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Studies only published in abstract format were eligible for inclusion if sufficient information was available. We would have included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials, if any had been identified in our search strategy. Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were administration of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole), comparisons were either placebo or no antiplatelet.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For this update we incorporated individual participant data (IPD) from trials with this available, alongside aggregate data (AD) from trials where it was not, in order to enable reliable subgroup analyses and inclusion of two key new outcomes. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

Seventy-seven trials (40,249 women, and their babies) were included, although three trials (relating to 233 women) did not contribute data to the meta-analysis. Nine of the trials contributing data were large (> 1000 women recruited), accounting for 80% of women recruited. Although the trials took place in a wide range of countries, all of the nine large trials involved only women in high-income and/or upper middle-income countries. IPD were available for 36 trials (34,514 women), including all but one of the large trials. Low-dose aspirin alone was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Dose in the large trials was 50 mg (1 trial, 1106 women), 60 mg (5 trials, 22,322 women), 75mg (1 trial, 3697 women) 100 mg (1 trial, 3294 women) and 150 mg (1 trial, 1776 women). Most studies were either low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias; and the large trials were all low risk of bas. Antiplatelet agents versus placebo/no treatment The use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia by 18% (36,716 women, 60 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; high-quality evidence), number needed to treat for one women to benefit (NNTB) 61 (95% CI 45 to 92). There was a small (9%) reduction in the RR for preterm birth < 37 weeks (35,212 women, 47 trials; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), NNTB 61 (95% CI 42 to 114), and a 14% reduction infetal deaths, neonatal deaths or death before hospital discharge (35,391 babies, 52 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; high-quality evidence), NNTB 197 (95% CI 115 to 681). Antiplatelet agents slightly reduced the risk of small-for-gestational age babies (35,761 babies, 50 trials; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; high-quality evidence), NNTB 146 (95% CI 90 to 386), and pregnancies with serious adverse outcome (a composite outcome including maternal death, baby death, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 17,382 women; 13 trials, high-quality evidence), NNTB 54 (95% CI 34 to 132). Antiplatelet agents probably slightly increase postpartum haemorrhage > 500 mL (23,769 women, 19 trials; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; moderate-quality evidence due to clinical heterogeneity), and they probably marginally increase the risk of placental abruption, although for this outcome the evidence was downgraded due to a wide confidence interval including the possibility of no effect (30,775 women; 29 trials; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54; moderate-quality evidence). Data from two large trials which assessed children at aged 18 months (including results from over 5000 children), did not identify clear differences in development between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Administering low-dose aspirin to pregnant women led to small-to-moderate benefits, including reductions in pre-eclampsia (16 fewer per 1000 women treated), preterm birth (16 fewer per 1000 treated), the baby being born small-for-gestational age (seven fewer per 1000 treated) and fetal or neonatal death (five fewer per 1000 treated). Overall, administering antiplatelet agents to 1000 women led to 20 fewer pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence for all these outcomes was high. Aspirin probably slightly increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 mL, however, the quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded to moderate, due to concerns of clinical heterogeneity in measurements of blood loss. Antiplatelet agents probably marginally increase placental abruption, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to low event numbers and thus wide 95% CI. Overall, antiplatelet agents improved outcomes, and at these doses appear to be safe. Identifying women who are most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin would improve targeting of treatment. As almost all the women in this review were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' gestation, it is unclear whether starting treatment before 12 weeks' would have additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects. While there was some indication that higher doses of aspirin would be more effective, further studies would be warranted to examine this.

Methods/design

Objectives

The objective of this review is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets reduce the severity of pre-eclampsia and/or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile, when commenced during pregnancy, and/or by dose.

The main questions to be addressed in this review are:

- Do antiplatelet agents, primarily low dose aspirin, have clinically important benefits for women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia and their babies?

Investigation of this hypothesis will also explore whether the treatment effect differs, in a clinically meaningful way, between women with different risk factors such as those with a history of early onset pre-eclampsia, renal disease, diabetes, chronic hypertension, or autoimmune disease.

- Does the planned dose of aspirin affect outcome in terms of preventing or delaying the onset of pre-eclampsia or other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth or perinatal death?

- Do the effects of aspirin differ according to gestation at onset of treatment?

Identifying studies

The search strategy to identify potentially eligible studies will include a search of the register of trials developed and maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group. Details of how this register is maintained are available elsewhere, but it involves extensive searching of bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and hand searching of relevant journals. Trialists will be asked if they know of any further studies. [See Additional file 1] for the list of trials potentially eligible for inclusion. In addition, all members of the Collaborative Group will be asked to notify any unpublished trials of which they are aware.

Recommendations of others — low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis for persons at high risk of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Additionally, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for individuals with more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia.

### Pre-eclampsia [^113SWXu1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy unique to humans and a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women who survive pre-eclampsia have reduced life expectancy, with increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while babies from a pre-eclamptic pregnancy have increased risks of preterm birth, perinatal death and neurodevelopmental disability and cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in life. Pre-eclampsia is a complex multisystem disease, diagnosed by sudden-onset hypertension (> 20 weeks of gestation) and at least one other associated complication, including proteinuria, maternal organ dysfunction or uteroplacental dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is found only when a placenta is or was recently present and is classified as preterm (delivery < 37 weeks of gestation), term (delivery ≥ 37 weeks of gestation) and postpartum pre-eclampsia. The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is driven by a dysfunctional placenta, which releases factors into maternal blood causing systemic inflammation and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Available treatments target maternal hypertension and seizures, but the only 'cure' for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the dysfunctional placenta and baby, often prematurely. Despite decades of research, the aetiology of pre-eclampsia, particularly of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, remains poorly defined. Significant advances have been made in the prediction and prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia, which is predicted in early pregnancy through combined screening and is prevented with daily low-dose aspirin, starting before 16 weeks of gestation. By contrast, the prediction of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia is limited and there are no preventive treatments. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, in particular of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, and evaluate new prognostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

Placental insufficiency and preeclampsia — antiplatelet therapy evidence indicates benefit across large syntheses. A systematic review of 59 trials in 37,560 women confirmed that antiplatelet therapy (mostly aspirin 60 mg/d) is beneficial; aspirin was associated with a 17% decrease in preeclampsia, an 8% reduction in preterm birth, a 14% reduction in neonatal death, and a 10% reduction in small-for-gestational age babies. An individual patient meta-analysis of 31 trials involving 32,217 patients showed a consistent benefit of aspirin for prevention of eclampsia with an overall 10% relative risk reduction across subgroups, including intended aspirin dose ≤ 75 mg/d or ≥ 75 mg/d; aspirin doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg/d accounted for 98% of women.

11 CONSIDERATIONS FOR UNIVERSAL ASPIRIN IN PRE‐ECLAMPSIA PREVENTION

Considering the clear benefit of aspirin in reducing the risk of preterm pre‐eclampsia, its low cost, and safety profile, some investigators advocate for universal aspirin prophylaxis for pre‐eclampsia prevention. It has been suggested that this would be a more cost‐effective strategy compared to using aspirin prophylaxis in women determined to be at high risk through a process of screening, which has been considered rather complex for implementation. Nevertheless, possible benefits of a preventive strategy need to be balanced with potential harm due to hemorrhagic and other adverse events. Benefits of universal aspirin and long‐term safety of this strategy have not been adequately studied in randomized trials. Additionally, good adherence to treatment is paramount to successful prevention. Compliance is likely to be lower when aspirin is given to the whole population than when recommended to a selected high‐risk group of women counselled based on individual risk. Earlier trials in which pregnant women received aspirin on the sole basis of being pregnant or nulliparous demonstrated an increased frequency of bleeding episodes, low compliance with aspirin at only about 50%, and no reduction in the incidence of pre‐eclampsia. Analogously, universal aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in healthy older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin in pregnancy [^111xbXnV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Aspirin has been long purported and extensively studied for prevention of preeclampsia. For this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend its use in pregnancy for preeclampsia prevention in those at high risk. Yet, much controversy exists regarding optimal use in pregnancy with guidelines across global organizations varying. In this narrative review, we summarize the published literature related to the safety, optimal dose, and timing and duration of use of aspirin, as well as other indications for which aspirin has been studied in pregnancy.

### A nudge toward universal aspirin for preeclampsia prevention [^115Aof9o]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The July 2018 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines for aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention represent a departure from prior, more stringent guidelines and extend eligibility for aspirin prophylaxis to a large proportion of pregnant women in the United States. However, these latest guidelines are predicated on a complex, risk-factor-based screening algorithm and ignore the reality that, outside of the setting of clinical research, effective implementation of risk-factor-based approaches consistently falls short. Herein we argue for transitioning to universal aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention using the concept of libertarian paternalism, knowing that altering the choice architecture from an "opt-in" to an "opt-out" system will greatly increase the number of patients who receive the advantage of this inexpensive, safe, and beneficial preventative intervention.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, and assessed the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia and who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### Preventing pre-eclampsia-are dietary factors the key? [^111Z545R]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Strategies to prevent pre-eclampsia: are dietary strategies the key?

The recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Schoenaker and colleagues reports an association between gestational hypertensive conditions, including pre-eclampsia, and dietary factors, based on observational studies. The review inclusion criteria were studies where energy intake, nutrient intake, food groups, or overall dietary patterns, either alone or in combination with dietary supplements, were reported, but excluded purely supplement-based studies. The findings of the review indicated that women with a low dietary calcium intake were more likely to be diagnosed with gestational hypertension, and while there were no significant associations between dietary content of vitamins C and E, vitamin D and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with pre-eclampsia, there was a suggestion (although not statistically significant) of a beneficial effect of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables on risk of pre-eclampsia.

How do these findings compare with the randomised trial literature evaluating strategies for the prevention of pre-eclampsia?

In general terms, the development of effective strategies for the prevention of pre-eclampsia has proven exceedingly difficult, related in part to the uncertainty of the precise 'cause' of the condition, and its likely multifactorial and complex nature. Many interventions have been proposed and evaluated in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, although low-dose aspirin and calcium supplementation remain the only strategies associated with a definitive reduction in risk. The use of antiplatelet agents has been associated with a 17% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia, and a modest 8% and 10% reduction in both preterm birth and small for gestational age infants, respectively. While calcium supplementation has been associated with a relative risk reduction of 55% in pre-eclampsia, this appears to be largely confined to women with low dietary calcium intake. Furthermore, the effects of calcium supplementation on improving measures of infant health are less clear.

The review by Schoenaker and colleagues demonstrated no significant associations between dietary content of vitamins C and E, vitamin D and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with pre-eclampsia. However, there was a suggested potential beneficial effect from a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, foods well recognised to be a rich source of vitamin C in particular. There has been considerable research interest in supplementation with anti-oxidant vitamins C and E as a potential strategy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Unfortunately, however, well conducted randomised trials and subsequent meta-analyses have demonstrated no beneficial effect of anti-oxidant vitamin supplementation in reducing a woman's risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy — timing, effect size, and eligibility: In a meta-analysis, daily low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy after 12 weeks' gestation significantly reduced the risk for preeclampsia in individuals at moderate or high risk compared with placebo (pooled relative risk: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.95]); aspirin use was also associated with significantly reduced risk for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia without increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, and only individuals with no prior adverse events or allergy to aspirin should be advised to take low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention.

### Low-dose aspirin for prevention of adverse outcomes related to abnormal placentation [^1131Er8Y]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis of randomized studies on the use of low-dose aspirin in women at high risk of preeclampsia (PE) has demonstrated that if treatment is initiated at ≤ 16weeks' gestation, there is significant reduction in the risk of PE [relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36–0.62], fetal growth restriction (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33–0.64), preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22–0.57) and perinatal death (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19–0.92), whereas the effect of treatment after 16weeks is substantially less (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.08; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97; and RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73–1.19, respectively). Moreover, the decrease in the risk of PE from early onset treatment seems to be related to the dose of aspirin, and a dose of > 80mg daily should be considered for optimal benefits.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112jyKJe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a multi-factorial condition. Although its aetiology remains unclear, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. The primary lesion is thought to be deficient trophoblast invasion of the maternal spiral arteries in the second trimester, leading to underperfusion of the uteroplacental circulation and placental ischaemia. The resulting placental damage is thought to lead to release of factors into the maternal circulation, which are responsible for the maternal syndrome. Activation of platelets and the clotting system may occur early in the course of the disease, before clinical symptoms develop. Deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, with excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation, have also been demonstrated to occur in pre-eclampsia. These observations have led to the hypothesis that antiplatelet agents, low dose aspirin (< 300 mg/day) in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia or reduce its severity and the risk of adverse events.

It is further hypothesised that the effect of antiplatelets may be different if treatment is started before placental implantation is complete. If this hypothesis were correct, the greatest benefit should be seen in women who started treatment before 16 weeks gestation, with the effect attenuating with later onset of treatment. Similarly, it remains unclear as to the most appropriate dose of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in order to maximise benefits whilst minimising harms. It has been suggested that low doses of aspirin may selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase pathway in platelet production but not in vessel wall endothelium thereby diminishing the synthesis of thromboxane but not of prostacycline. A higher dose may inhibit both thromboxane and prostacycline thereby neutralising the effect of the intervention. However, there is also limited evidence from randomised trials that a higher dose of aspirin may effect a greater reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Low-dose aspirin therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia: time to reconsider our recommendations? [^112DdEso]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiation of 81 mg of aspirin daily for women at risk of preeclampsia between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, with continuation until delivery. The World Health Organization recommends that 75 mg of aspirin should be initiated before 20 weeks of gestation for women at high risk of preeclampsia. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence quality statement on "Antenatal Assessment of Pre-eclampsia Risk" request that healthcare providers prescribe low-dose aspirin to pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia daily from 12 weeks of gestation. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends 150 mg of aspirin daily, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggest risk stratification with a dosage of 75 mg for those at moderate risk of preeclampsia and 150 mg for those at high risk of preeclampsia. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics initiative on preeclampsia recommends 150 mg of aspirin to be initiated at 11 to 14+6 week's gestation and also proposes that 2 tablets of 81 mg is an acceptable alternative. Review of the available evidence suggests that both the dosage and timing of aspirin initiation is key to its effectiveness at reducing the risk of preeclampsia. Doses of > 100 mg of aspirin daily initiated before 16 weeks' gestation seem to be most effective at reducing the risk of preeclampsia and thus dosages recommended by most major societies and organizations may not be effective. Randomized control trials examining 81 mg vs 162 mg of aspirin daily for the prevention of preeclampsia are required to assess the safety and efficacy of aspirin dosages available in the United States.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors: a systematic review [^111FRPrc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with predisposing historical risk factors, such as previous history of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease.

Data Sources

Searches were conductes in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, National Research Register, SCISEARCH, AND ISI Conference Proceedings without any language restrictions, using the following medical subject headings and text words: "aspirin", "antiplatelet", "salicyl", "acetylsalicyl", "platelet aggregation inhibitors", "pre-eclamp", "preeclamp", and "hypertens*.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included all randomized trials that evaluated the effectiveness of aspirin compared with placebo or no treatment in women with predisposing historical risk factors and reported clinically relevant perinatal or maternal outcomes. Study selection, quality appraisal, and data extractions were performed independently and in duplicate. We identified 14 relevant trials, including a total of 12,416 women. Meta-analysis showed a significant benefit of aspirin therapy in reducing perinatal death (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.96) and preeclampsia (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76, 0.96). Aspirin was also associated with a reduction in rates of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79, 0.94), and an increase of 215 g in mean birth weight (weighted mean difference 215, 95% CI 90, 341). There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79, 1.21). Funnel plot analysis indicated that publication and related biases were unlikely (Egger test, P = 0.84).

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk of perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors. Given the importance of these outcomes and the safety and low cost of aspirin, aspirin therapy should be considered in women with historical risk factors.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112aRfPe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Summary of systematic review of aggregate data in 2004

The updated Cochrane Review identified 51 trials with over 36,500 pregnant women evaluating antiplatelet agents, principally low dose aspirin, for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Nine of these trials included over 1000 women, and 15 involved less than 50 women. Fifty-one studies were excluded, mostly due to the non-availability of clinically relevant data. Aggregate data from the included trials demonstrated a 19% reduction (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.88) in the risk of developing pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. There was also a small (7%) reduction in the risk of pre-term birth (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.98) and a 16% reduction in the risk of the baby dying (RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74–0.96). Based on the average risk of women included in these trials, about 70 women would have to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia, and 240 to prevent one baby death.

These effects are much smaller than had initially been hoped for but, nevertheless, potentially they have considerable public health importance. The conclusion from this aggregate data review was that for most low-risk women large numbers of women would need to be treated with antiplatelets agents to prevent one episode of either pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Whether there are specific high risk sub-groups of pregnant women for whom there might be greater benefits, remains unclear, as does the best time to initiate treatment, and at what dose. The aim is now to extend this review based on aggregate data, to utilise the available data for every individual woman in each trial to help address these remaining questions. The use of individual data for each woman will allow for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes. This review will therefore provide more specific information to guide the care of women at risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^111EnQhf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia and its consequences, such as preterm birth and perinatal mortality, uncertainty remains regarding whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start, and whether treatment effectiveness is dependent on antiplatelet dose.

The best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from all women enrolled in trials that have addressed this question. This approach has been described as the 'gold standard' of systematic review methodology as it allows for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes.

The PARIS Collaboration has been formed to undertake a systematic review of all available trials, with meta-analysis based on individual patient data, to answer these important clinical questions. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Provision of data by the participating Collaborators commenced in 2004, and results will be ready for presentation in 2006. Following consultation and discussion with the Collaborative Group, the main publication is expected in early 2007.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994–1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of aspirin or gestation at randomisation. Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0.75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, > 10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.

Benefits of risk assessment and preventive medication — randomized trials of low-dose aspirin in persons at increased risk for preeclampsia showed reduced risks for preterm birth (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67–0.95]; 13 studies; I2 = 49%) among individuals receiving low-dose aspirin (n = 13 619), small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; 16 studies; I2 = 41.0%) (n = 14 385), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.96]; 11 studies; I2 = 0%) (n = 13 860), and preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.95]; 16 studies; I2 = 0%) (n = 14 093); the USPSTF considered 18 randomized clinical trials (n = 19 500) for maternal and perinatal outcomes and 16 RCTs (n = 15 767; 10 good-quality) for preeclampsia prevention, with aspirin dosages ranging from 50 to 150 mg/d, most trials using 60 mg/d (6 RCTs) or 100 mg/d (8 RCTs), and initiation most often before 20 weeks of gestation but ranging from 11 to 32 weeks, and stratified comparisons did not show consistent evidence for effect differences related to the timing of aspirin initiation (< 16 weeks of gestation), the dosage used, or participant characteristics.

Practice considerations — patient population and diagnostic thresholds: This recommendation applies to pregnant persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia and who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin. Preeclampsia is defined by hypertension as office-based blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg on 2 separate occasions during the second half of pregnancy (> 20 weeks), accompanied by proteinuria; proteinuria is defined as a 24-hour urine collection containing greater than 300 mg protein, a single voided urine protein to creatinine ratio of 0.3 or greater, or a urine dipstick.

Although it is known that pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder, the relationship between the placental pathology and maternal endothelial response is not fully understood. Numerous maternal factors can predispose to the disorder, such as previous pre-eclampsia, diabetes, renal disease, chronic hypertension or other risk factors. The syndrome known as pre-eclampsia may also be more than one disease, each with distinct origins, pathologic characteristics and natural history, rather than one fundamental process with varying degrees of clinical severity. Hence, the ability to assess the affect of antiplatelets on women with individual risk factors, or a series of risk factors, is of great relevance to clinicians and women. A meta-analysis based on data from individual women will enable the exploration of these hypotheses.

Randomised trials of antiplatelet agents

The effects of antiplatelet agents were first evaluated in small randomised trials, which reported striking reductions in the risk of hypertension and proteinuria. These trials were too small to provide reliable information about other more substantive outcomes, such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth. Also, there was no information about the potential hazards of antiplatelet therapy, such as a possible increased risk of bleeding for both the woman and her baby, or possible effects on infant and child development. The promising results of these early trials led to several large studies around the world. Before these could be completed, however, the use of low dose aspirin had already become relatively widespread for women considered at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Results of the larger trials were disappointing, as they failed to confirm any statistically significant reductions in substantive outcomes. Nevertheless, the first Cochrane Review of these trials demonstrated that, when taken together, there are modest, but clinically important benefits.
