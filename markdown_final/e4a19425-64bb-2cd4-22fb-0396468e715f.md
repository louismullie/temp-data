## Question

What are the potential mechanisms by which ivermectin may exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential mechanisms by which ivermectin may exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanistic hypotheses from in vitro and translational work. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic plausibility in humans, including lung concentrations and the concentration–response relationship. Next, I will examine clinical evidence for mechanistic signals like viral load effects and timing of therapy. After that, I need to consider confounders and alternative explanations, including anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic effects. Finally, I will integrate the totality of evidence and align with guideline positions to state what is known, uncertain, and not supported clinically.

> Let me first confirm the primary mechanistic hypothesis. Multiple sources converge on inhibition of nuclear import as the leading proposed antiviral mechanism, whereby ivermectin binds to the importin α/β1 heterodimer and disrupts trafficking of viral proteins into the nucleus, thereby impairing early replication steps of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses. This is supported by in vitro work and mechanistic reviews, and it aligns with the broader observation that several RNA viruses rely on importin-mediated nuclear transport for replication [^4e295db1] [^58a540d4] [^ba0a0167].

> Wait, let me verify the concentration–response claim. The in vitro antiviral effect appears concentration dependent, with reports of activity at micromolar levels and suggestions that higher or repeated dosing could be necessary to achieve clinically relevant exposure. However, I should be cautious because standard oral dosing produces plasma concentrations far below these in vitro IC50s, so any clinical antiviral effect would require either very high dosing, favorable tissue distribution, or synergy with other agents, which remains uncertain in humans [^ba0a0167] [^e6e09df4] [^76685252].

> I need to check pharmacokinetic plausibility in the lung, the target site. Modeling and translational data suggest ivermectin may accumulate in lung tissue to levels roughly 10-fold above plasma, and a proof-of-concept RCT reported that patients achieving higher plasma ivermectin concentrations had greater viral decay, implying a concentration–response relationship. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these lung concentration estimates are extrapolated and the clinical correlation was exploratory, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^9092c79e] [^5793f9b5] [^6a51875d].

> Next, I should review direct clinical signals for antiviral activity. Several trials and meta-analyses have examined viral clearance at day 7, with some showing no difference and others suggesting faster clearance, albeit with very low certainty and substantial heterogeneity. For example, a Cochrane analysis found no clear effect on viral clearance at day 7, whereas a small inpatient RCT suggested faster virologic clearance with a 5-day course, and a proof-of-concept study linked higher plasma levels to faster viral decay. I should double-check that these signals are inconsistent and often not corroborated by larger, high-quality trials, which tempers inference about true antiviral effects in vivo [^f92c370c] [^93b36d93] [^e6e09df4].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of timing. The mechanistic rationale predicts benefit with early treatment during active viral replication, and some clinical studies operationalized early initiation within 5–7 days of symptom onset. However, even in early-treatment trials, signals have been inconsistent, with the TOGETHER platform RCT showing no reduction in hospitalization or ED visits and ACTIV-6 showing no improvement in time to recovery, while smaller studies reported trends in symptom resolution or viral metrics. This pattern suggests that if an antiviral effect exists, it is either modest, context-specific, or not reliably captured by current endpoints and dosing strategies [^278acdc8] [^3c34fcb9] [^72f9569d].

> Let me consider alternative mechanisms that could confound interpretation. Ivermectin has documented anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, including reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and there is a hypothesis that glycine receptor agonism contributes to immunomodulation. Additionally, in settings with high helminth prevalence, ivermectin's antiparasitic effects could reduce co-infection burden and indirectly improve COVID-19 outcomes, complicating attribution of benefit to direct antiviral activity. I should confirm that these indirect effects remain plausible contributors in some studies and regions [^62aaddf6] [^bb3a101b] [^93b36d93].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence hierarchy to avoid overinterpreting low-quality data. Large, rigorously conducted RCTs such as TOGETHER and ACTIV-19/ACTIV-6 have not demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on hospitalization, recovery, or viral clearance, and high-quality systematic reviews and living guidelines conclude that ivermectin should not be used outside trials. Mechanistic plausibility alone is insufficient when Phase III trials are negative or neutral, so I need to ensure that mechanistic claims are framed as hypothetical rather than established clinical effects [^278acdc8] [^3c34fcb9] [^8230cd44] [^e2e60135].

> But wait, what if higher dosing changes the equation? The proof-of-concept RCT's concentration–viral decay correlation is intriguing, yet it did not translate into improved clinical outcomes in that study, and safety considerations limit how high dosing can go in humans. Until dose-optimized regimens with validated exposure–response relationships and hard clinical endpoints are available, the antiviral mechanism remains unproven in practice, and guideline bodies appropriately recommend against routine use outside trials [^e6e09df4] [^8230cd44] [^e2a4cdcf].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about certainty. The importin α/β1 nuclear import inhibition hypothesis is biologically coherent and supported by in vitro data, and there are suggestive but inconsistent clinical signals linking higher drug exposure to faster viral decay or modest symptom improvements in small, early-treatment cohorts. However, large, high-quality RCTs have not confirmed clinically meaningful antiviral benefit, pharmacokinetic plausibility remains uncertain for achieving target concentrations safely, and confounding by anti-inflammatory or antiparasitic effects cannot be excluded in several studies. Therefore, ivermectin may have a plausible antiviral mechanism, but there is no established, clinically actionable antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 at this time [^4e295db1] [^9092c79e] [^278acdc8] [^3c34fcb9] [^8230cd44].

Ivermectin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 through **importin α/β1-mediated nuclear transport blockade** of viral proteins, thereby disrupting replication [^4e295db1] [^58a540d4]. It also shows **anti-inflammatory effects** by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) [^62aaddf6] and may modulate immune responses, though clinical relevance remains uncertain [^8c997595]. In vitro activity requires micromolar concentrations [^6a51875d] not reliably achieved with standard oral dosing, and clinical trials have not shown consistent benefits [^e2e60135] [^278acdc8]. Current guidelines recommend against routine use outside trials [^8230cd44] [^e2a4cdcf].

## Proposed antiviral mechanisms

### Inhibition of nuclear import of viral proteins

- **Importin α/β1 blockade**: Ivermectin binds importin α/β1, blocking nuclear transport of viral proteins (including SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and accessory proteins), thereby disrupting replication [^4e295db1] [^58a540d4].
- **Broad-spectrum relevance**: This mechanism has been observed with other RNA viruses (e.g. HIV-1, dengue, influenza), supporting plausibility for SARS-CoV-2 [^4e295db1] [^58a540d4].

---

### Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects

- **Cytokine modulation**: Ivermectin reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in vitro and in vivo, potentially mitigating cytokine storm [^62aaddf6].
- **Immune modulation**: It may enhance interferon responses and reduce excessive inflammation, though clinical significance is unclear [^notfound].

---

### Direct interaction with viral components

Molecular modeling suggests ivermectin may bind the **RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)** [^62aaddf6], though this remains speculative and not validated in vivo.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

- **Concentration discrepancy**: In vitro antiviral effects occur at 2–5 µM [^6a51875d], far above the ~0.1 µM Cmax with standard oral dosing (200–400 µg/kg) [^76685252].
- **Lung accumulation**: Modeling suggests lung concentrations may exceed plasma by ~10-fold, but even then, reaching IC50 is uncertain without supratherapeutic dosing [^5793f9b5] [^6a51875d].
- **High-dose trials**: Clinical studies using 600–1200 µg/kg have explored higher exposure, but safety and efficacy remain under evaluation [^e6e09df4] [^8ac665a2].

---

## Clinical evidence summary

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| In vitro studies | - Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication at micromolar concentrations [^6a51875d] [^4e295db1] |
| Clinical trials | - Mixed results; no consistent benefit on viral clearance, symptoms, or mortality [^e2e60135] [^278acdc8] [^3c34fcb9] |
| Systematic reviews | - Low to very low certainty evidence; no definitive clinical benefit identified [^e2e60135] [^4edcf70e] |
| Guidelines | - WHO, IDSA, and ACP recommend against routine use outside trials [^8230cd44] [^e2a4cdcf] [^8359bf78] |

---

## Limitations and uncertainties

- **Concentration gap**: Achieving effective concentrations in humans remains uncertain without high-dose regimens [^6a51875d] [^76685252].
- **Clinical heterogeneity**: Variability in dosing, timing, and patient populations complicates interpretation [^970d8c62].
- **Safety concerns**: High-dose or prolonged use may increase adverse effects, including neurotoxicity [^b74462e3].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines advise against routine ivermectin use for COVID-19 outside trials: WHO advises **do not use** ivermectin for COVID-19 except in clinical trials [^8230cd44], IDSA recommends against ivermectin in both inpatient and outpatient settings [^e2a4cdcf], and ACP advises **do not use** ivermectin for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^8359bf78].

---

Ivermectin shows **plausible in vitro mechanisms** — notably importin α/β1 blockade and anti-inflammatory effects — but clinical translation is unproven due to inadequate concentrations and inconsistent trial results. Routine use is not recommended pending higher-quality evidence [^8230cd44].

Background

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 treatment is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID-19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life).

Main Results

We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non-randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID-19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID-19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and three were open-label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in 'awaiting classification' until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. Ivermectin for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate-to-severe disease We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low-certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. Ivermectin for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global-10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low-certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low-certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low-certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

For outpatients, there is currently low- to high-certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19. Based on the very low-certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low-certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search.

### Antiviral effect of high-dose ivermectin in adults with COVID-19: a proof-of-concept randomized trial [^ba0a0167]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The assessment of the effect of drug candidates against viruses causing acute respiratory infections is hampered by several aspects of these host-pathogen relationships including rapid immune control of viral replication and high variability in symptom scores among patients. For that reason, key components for adequate endpoints are sensitive quantifiable measurements of the underlying cause as the quantitative RT-PCR. As it has been proposed in an influenza model of antiviral candidate drugs evaluation 25, viral decay rates proved to be a critical parameter of antiviral activity. Additionally, as it has been clearly demonstrated for acute viral infections, early treatment initiation plays a critical role. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be confirmed in trials with clinical endpoints. Beyond clinical aspects, lowering viral burden might influence infectivity, although there is conflicting data regarding the relationship between burden of viral shedding and infectivity. The proposed antiviral mechanism of IVM is through its ability to inhibit the nuclear import of viral proteins mediated by IMPα/β1 heterodimer, and it has also been suggested that IVM could promote defense mechanisms such as pyroptosis in infected epithelial cells. Drugs such as ivermectin can be used to target viral entry or viral replication mechanisms in host cells, as well as to modulate the innate immune responses, to achieve indirect antiviral activity in vivo. Mechanisms essential for viral infection, such as nuclear transport or intracellular signal transduction, among others, have been indicated as better targets to identify broad-spectrum antiviral agents, with some advantages over direct-acting antivirals targeting viral components.

In summary, our findings support the hypothesis that IVM has a concentration dependent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and provides insights into the type of evaluations to be considered in the assessment of antiviral drugs for the control of COVID-19. Follow-up trials to confirm our findings and to identify the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19 are warranted.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^f291d220]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent used to treat parasitic infestations, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 treatment is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID-19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), medRxiv, and Research Square, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 26 May 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity, treated in inpatient or outpatient settings, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing ivermectin to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. The primary analysis excluded studies with high risk of bias. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes 1. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, adverse events, quality of life, duration of hospitalization, and viral clearance; 2. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, admission to hospital, adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance; (3) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, adverse events, mortality, admission to hospital, and quality of life.

Main Results

We found 14 studies with 1678 participants investigating ivermectin compared to no treatment, placebo, or standard of care. No study compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. There were nine studies treating participants with moderate COVID-19 in inpatient settings and four treating mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. One study investigated ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eight studies had an open-label design, six were double-blind and placebo-controlled. Of the 41 study results contributed by included studies, about one third were at overall high risk of bias. Ivermectin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies. We identified 31 ongoing and 18 studies awaiting classification until publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for inpatient COVID-19 treatment We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 2 studies, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to day 28 assessed as need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.59; 2 studies, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or need for supplemental oxygen (0 participants required supplemental oxygen; 1 study, 45 participants; very low-certainty evidence), adverse events within 28 days (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.97; 1 study, 152 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day seven (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.48; 2 studies, 159 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on clinical improvement up to 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 study; 73 participants; low-certainty evidence) and duration of hospitalization (mean difference (MD) -0.10 days, 95% CI -2.43 to 2.23; 1 study; 45 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for outpatient COVID-19 treatment We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality up to 28 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to 14 days assessed as need for IMV (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.47; 1 study, 398 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or non-IMV or high flow oxygen requirement (0 participants required non-IMV or high flow; 1 study, 398 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo reduces or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; 1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on the number of participants with symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; 1 study, 398 participants; low-certainty evidence) and adverse events within 28 days (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for primary analysis. No study reported hospital admission or quality of life up to 14 days. Ivermectin compared to no treatment for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection We found one study. Mortality up to 28 days was the only outcome eligible for primary analysis. We are uncertain whether ivermectin reduces or increases mortality compared to no treatment (0 participants died; 1 study, 304 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported results for development of COVID-19 symptoms and adverse events up to 14 days that were included in a secondary analysis due to high risk of bias. No study reported SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, and quality of life up to 14 days.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID-19. The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 outside of well-designed randomized trials.

### The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^75eb08f8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Albeit requiring confirmation, these results raise several important questions. If the mechanism of action of ivermectin against COVID-19 is related to a nicotinic effect, then inhibitory concentrations for this receptor (which are in the nanomolar range) could be achievable in the lung tissue for a short period of time with oral dosing and for considerably longer periods with nebulized therapy. If the mechanism is immunomodulatory, then the appropriate dose and regimen should be tailored accordingly. Before considering higher or multiple dose schemes, there is also need to better understand the potential role of ivermectin´s metabolites in any observed effect. Finally, given the tendency to lower IgG titers in the ivermectin group, there is need to evaluate the potential relationship between ivermectin treatment, disease severity, inflammation, viral dynamics and antibody titers; particular attention should be paid to the long-term humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in ivermectin treated patients.

This pilot points towards a potential use of ivermectin in COVID-19 which warrants further exploration under larger trials, with clinical outcomes in patients with risk factors or more severe disease. This is of particular importance for settings with limited resources given ivermectin´s low price, broad availability and scalability of manufacturing processes.

This pilot has several key limitations that warrant careful interpretation of the results. Firstly, it was designed to explore a potential signal for the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, not to provide definitive evidence on the subject, hence its small sample size. Second this pilot was restricted to subjects with non-severe disease and no risk factors in whom the treatment was provided in the first 48 h of fever or cough, this should be taken into consideration for the design of any confirmatory studies to be conducted. Additionally, the quantification of the viral load presented is intrinsically limited by heterogeneity in the samples, even if all were obtained by the same clinicians, standardization against a human epithelial cell gene would be required to ensure the viral loads are truly comparable.

The positive signal found in this pilot warrants the conduction of larger trials using ivermectin for the early treatment of COVID-19. Such trials should include patients with risk factors for severe disease as well as patients with pneumonia. The potential for a mechanism of action different to direct antiviral effect also opens the door for pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups.

### Ivermectin for COVID-19 in adults in the community (PRINCIPLE): an open, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial of short-and longer-term outcomes [^62aaddf6]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ivermectin is a safe, cheap, well tolerated and widely used anti-parasitic drug that has been widely promoted and trialled as a treatment for COVID-19. There are various mechanisms by which ivermectin could have activity against SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin may inhibit the binding and within-cell transport to the nucleus of viral proteins that normally suppress the cell's anti-viral response, enhancing the host cell's ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In-vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that ivermectin significantly reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, Interleukin–1 beta and Interleukin 6; and could therefore reduce the cytokine storm and ensuing cellular damage that occurs in some individuals with COVID-19. However, in-vitro studies have used concentrations of drug which are substantially higher than may be achievable in plasma using clinical dosing. In a molecular modelling study, ivermectin appeared to bind with high stability to RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), suggesting that ivermectin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 activity through RdRp inhibition.

Some early trials found that ivermectin reduced hospital admissions and death from COVID-19, but several of these trials were found to be flawed, for example due to inadequate or lack of description of randomisation, lack of allocation concealment, or evidence of differences between arms at baseline, requiring meta-analyses to be updated. Despite the controversial evidence base, prescriptions for the drug increased dramatically in the USA and many other parts of the world.

Recent systematic reviews have found insufficient evidence of benefit from ivermectin on recovery outcomes, hospital admission, ventilation, or mortality, while one concluded there was insufficient evidence to make a firm recommendation. Shaifee and colleagues included 17 trials in a meta-analysis and concluded ivermectin should not be used outside of clinical trials for COVID-19, or should be used with caution. A Cochrane review found that ivermectin in addition to usual care versus usual care alone or placebo probably has little or no effect on outcomes including admission to hospital or death within 28 days, but that the certainty of these conclusions was very low for many outcomes including hospital admission and clinical improvement. Furthermore, none of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis. Some of the benefits from ivermectin treatment may be related to its antiparasitic effect in areas of high prevalence of parasite infection.

1 Introduction

The emergence of a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan in December 2019 and its pandemic spread causing COVID-19 at a global scale, with over 85 million reported cases and 1.7 million deaths by the end of 2020 has prompted the search for pharmacologic interventions to treat, prevent and mitigate the consequences of this potentially devastating acute respiratory infection. Several therapeutic agents have been evaluated at different disease stages as potential antiviral therapies; most of them as part of a drug repurposing strategy for active principles already used in other therapeutic indications. Although different molecules such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and remdesivir have demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials has only demonstrated clinical benefits for intravenous remdesivir in some groups of hospitalized patients.

Ivermectin (IVM) is a widely used antiparasitic drug with over 900 million tablets distributed in 2019 through the Mectizan Donation Program for the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. More recently, several viral infections like Dengue, Zika, and Influenza were shown to be susceptible in vitro most likely through host-based mechanisms. A potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Vero-hSLAM cell cultures using high concentrations of IVM. In a model of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics with acquired immune response to investigate the dynamic impact of timing and dosing regimens, the most significant effects for ivermectin were identified with earlier and longer exposure at high doses; in this regard, repeated daily doses of ivermectin at 600 µg/kg had meaningful impact whereas doses of 300 µg/kg had significantly lower effects. Doses of 300 µg/kg were recently found not to be superior to placebo in a randomized clinical trial in Colombia. IVM is prescribed in weight-based regimens, most frequently at 200 µg/kg, with a proposed link between Cmax and toxicity. Higher dose regimens are under evaluation due to their potential utility for new indications and dosing strategies. Single dose regimens of up to 2000 µg/kg have been used in a trial in healthy volunteers without clinically significant safety issues.

### Antiviral effect of high-dose ivermectin in adults with COVID-19: a proof-of-concept randomized trial [^acdad5e5]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the antiviral activity and safety profile of high dose IVM in COVID-19 patients we completed a proof-of-concept randomized controlled clinical trial in hospitalized patients. To achieve further insights into the potential clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19, the relationship between pharmacokinetic (PK) (IVM plasma concentrations) and pharmacodynamic (PD) (dynamic of the viral load) aspects was investigated. Here we present the results of the trial with descriptions on the impact of IVM on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory secretions.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^7d47f95a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.

For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion.

Data collection and analysis

We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life).

Main results

We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias.

We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in 'awaiting classification' until the trial authors clarify questions upon request.

Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate‐to‐severe disease

We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point.

Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease

Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo(RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta‐analysis.

Authors' conclusions

For outpatients, there is currently low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID‐19. Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search.

### The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^4b74e4ab]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

As of December 21, 2020, there have been over 70 million cases and 1·6 million COVID-19 deaths worldwide. Although the threshold is difficult to predict accurately, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to stop before at least 50% of the population has gained immunity, either by vaccination or recovering from a naturally-acquired infection. There are now promising vaccines candidates advancing to emergency regulatory approval, but there is a projected delay in global access to the level required for population impact on the trajectory of the pandemic. While efforts are ongoing to develop treatment options, relatively less attention has been devoted to evaluating drug-based transmission blocking or transmission reduction strategies. These strategies would consist in administering a drug with the aim of reducing onward transmission by those infected and could serve to reduce the burden on health system and gain time until vaccines are fully tested and scaled-up.

Ivermectin is a widely used antiparasitic drug with known partial efficacy against several single-strain RNA viruses. Caly et al. reported in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication using micromolar concentrations of ivermectin. These findings, together with early observational evidence and ecological evidence, prompted several Latin-American countries to include ivermectin as part of the national policy for COVID-19 treatment.

As of December 21, 2020, there are 45 studies evaluating the efficacy of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 registered in clinicaltrials.gov, and 74 trials registered in WHO´s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of which at least 14 are already completed. Although some observational and case control studies as well as emerging small randomized clinical trials suggest a potential utility. Yet, there is still a dearth of robust, randomized controlled trials to appropriately inform policy decisions.

This trial was designed as a pilot to evaluate whether the maximum approved dose of ivermectin in Europe could have an impact on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when administered early after disease onset.

4 Discussion

In spite of its partial antiviral properties, ivermectin received limited early attention in Europe or the US as a potential drug to be repurposed against COVID-19. This was largely based on one pharmacokinetic model stressing the inability of currently approved oral doses to reach lung tissue levels at the antiviral concentrations described by Caly et al.even if other, peer-reviewed models predict up to 10-fold accumulation of ivermectin in target tissue. There are additional reasons to avoid direct inferences from the results of in vitro experiments or pharmacokinetic models, these include the potential role of ivermectin metabolites, the potential immunomodulatory role of the drug, and questions about the virus/cell ratios and appropriateness of the Vero cellular lines used in the cultures.

This pilot study was designed to assess the question of whether further investments in the potential repurposing of ivermectin were warranted. As such, we aimed at generating evidence on viral kinetics, antibody response and clinical efficacy in a cohort of patients at low risk of severe disease. Without a clearly defined mechanism of action, a sole signal in any of said parameters would not suffice to justify further efforts. This pilot shows a tendency to lower viral loads in the ivermectin group, a tendency to lower IgG titers that may reflect milder disease and clinical benefit in cardinal symptoms of COVID-19 associated with tissue damage: anosmia/hyposmia and cough. These results are in line with emerging evidence from trials in Bangladesh and Argentinashowing a faster viral clearance in treated participants, as well as with recent data from a SARS-CoV-2 hamster model from Institute Pasteur which also showed a marked sex dichotomy in the effect of ivermectin on anosmia/hyposmia.

### Antiviral effect of high-dose ivermectin in adults with COVID-19: a proof-of-concept randomized trial [^9092c79e]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This proof-of-concept trial designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of IVM against SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients with COVID-19 showed no differences between treatment and control groups in its primary endpoint which was the difference in SARS-CoV-2 viral load between baseline and day-5 (Fig. 1). However, our results indicate a concentration-dependent antiviral activity of IVM in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients treated within 5 days of symptoms onset. This statistically significant difference was identified for the relationship between IVM plasma concentrations and the primary outcome (Figs. 3 & 4); which confirms previous in vitro activity shown in cell cultures. Findings on IVM plasma concentrations are in agreement with human SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic models identifying the need for high doses, but contradict those concerns stating that those drug concentrations would not be achievable at safe doses. The extensive pattern of IVM distribution to lung tissue has been well characterized in cattle and pigs, with the later also achieving in nasopharyngeal tissue higher levels than plasma. Considering that similar volumes of distribution have been reported for IVM in both cattle and humans and the systemic availability observed in this clinical trial, it is reasonable to estimate median IVM levels > 395 ng/g in lung tissue. A similar pattern of IVM distribution to lung tissue has been recently simulated using a minimal physiologically based PK model.

The antiviral effect was seen after IVM plasma concentration measurements allowed discrimination between patients achieving higher levels and identifying a direct relationship between drug concentration and viral elimination. Additionally, relevant conclusions on the natural history of the illness can be derived from the behavior of the control group in this trial, which demonstrates the self-limited nature of viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infections, that in 22% of the cases was already below the limit of quantification at baseline; a finding similar to what has been observed in a trial evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, highlighting the relevance of adequate timing of implementation of antiviral treatment as has been shown in a recently published pilot double-blind trial randomized trial of IVM for non-severe COVID-19 that identified statistically significant differences in the duration of anosmia and trends towards lower viral load with treatments started within 72 h of symptoms onset.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^9e4d9bba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent used to treat parasitic infestations, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in the early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), medRxiv, and Research Square, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 26 May 2021.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity, treated in inpatient or outpatient settings, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.

We excluded studies comparing ivermectin to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data collection and analysis

We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. The primary analysis excluded studies with high risk of bias. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes 1. to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, adverse events, quality of life, duration of hospitalization, and viral clearance; 2. to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, admission to hospital, adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance; (3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, adverse events, mortality, admission to hospital, and quality of life.

Main results

We found 14 studies with 1678 participants investigating ivermectin compared to no treatment, placebo, or standard of care. No study compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. There were nine studies treating participants with moderate COVID‐19 in inpatient settings and four treating mild COVID‐19 cases in outpatient settings. One study investigated ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Eight studies had an open‐label design, six were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled. Of the 41 study results contributed by included studies, about one third were at overall high risk of bias.

Ivermectin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies.

We identified 31 ongoing and 18 studies awaiting classification until publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies.

Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for inpatient COVID‐19 treatment

We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 2 studies, 185 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to day 28 assessed as need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.59; 2 studies, 185 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or need for supplemental oxygen (0 participants required supplemental oxygen; 1 study, 45 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), adverse events within 28 days (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.97; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day seven (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.48; 2 studies, 159 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on clinical improvement up to 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 study; 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and duration of hospitalization (mean difference (MD) −0.10 days, 95% CI −2.43 to 2.23; 1 study; 45 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life up to 28 days.

Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for outpatient COVID‐19 treatment

We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality up to 28 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to 14 days assessed as need for IMV (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.47; 1 study, 398 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or non‐IMV or high flow oxygen requirement (0 participants required non‐IMV or high flow; 1 study, 398 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo reduces or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; 1 study, 24 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on the number of participants with symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; 1 study, 398 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and adverse events within 28 days (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the studies reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for primary analysis. No study reported hospital admission or quality of life up to 14 days.

Ivermectin compared to no treatment for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

We found one study. Mortality up to 28 days was the only outcome eligible for primary analysis. We are uncertain whether ivermectin reduces or increases mortality compared to no treatment (0 participants died; 1 study, 304 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported results for development of COVID‐19 symptoms and adverse events up to 14 days that were included in a secondary analysis due to high risk of bias. No study reported SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, hospital admission, and quality of life up to 14 days.

Authors' conclusions

Based on the current very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID‐19. The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized trials.

### Antiviral effect of high-dose ivermectin in adults with COVID-19: a proof-of-concept randomized trial [^e6e09df4]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited antiviral options for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone with a wide anti-parasitary spectrum, has shown potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This study aimed at assessing the antiviral effect of IVM on viral load of respiratory secretions and its relationship with drug concentrations in plasma.

Methods

Proof-of-concept, pilot, randomized, controlled, outcome-assessor blinded trial to evaluate antiviral activity of high-dose IVM in 45 COVID-19 hospitalized patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to standard of care plus oral IVM at 0·6 mg/kg/day for 5 days versus standard of care in 4 hospitals in Argentina. Eligible patients were adults with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptoms onset. The primary endpoint was the difference in viral load in respiratory secretions between baseline and day-5, by quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of IVM in plasma were measured. Study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04381884.

Findings

45 participants were recruited (30 to IVM and 15 controls) between May 18 and September 9, 2020. There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59–77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31–73) (p = 0·004). Mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels correlated with viral decay rate (r: 0·47, p = 0·02). Adverse events were similar between groups. No differences in clinical evolution at day-7 and day-30 between groups were observed.

Interpretation

A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high-dose IVM was identified at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated. Large trials with clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19.

Funding

This work was supported by grant IP-COVID-19-625, Agencia Nacional de Promoción de la Investigación, el Desarrollo Tecnológico y la Innovación, Argentina and Laboratorio ELEA/Phoenix, Argentina.

### The approved dose of ivermectin alone is not the ideal dose for the treatment of COVID-19 [^76685252]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Caly et al.reported that ivermectin inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in vitr o with an 50% inhibition (IC 50), which was > 35× higher than the peak plasma concentration (C max) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ What ivermectin dose reaches the IC 50 in the lungs after oral administration in humans?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC 50 in the lungs after oral administration of the approved dose or doses 10× higher than the approved doses as a single dose. The approved dose of ivermectin alone has a low probability of a success in the treatment of cornonavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19).
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Repurposing drugs for use in COVID‐19 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of repurposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.

### Favorable antiviral effect of metformin on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of COVID-19 [^362876ee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mechanism appears to be suppression of protein translation via targeting the host mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. In the COVID-OUT randomized trial for outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), metformin reduced the odds of hospitalizations/death through 28 days by 58%, of emergency department visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days by 42%, and of long COVID through 10 months by 42%.

Methods

COVID-OUT was a 2 × 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that assessed metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin; 999 participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs on day 1 (n = 945), day 5 (n = 871), and day 10 (n = 775). Viral load was quantified using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Results

The mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.05 to -.06; P = 0.027). Those who received metformin were less likely to have a detectable viral load than placebo at day 5 or day 10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, .55 to .94). Viral rebound, defined as a higher viral load at day 10 than day 5, was less frequent with metformin (3.28%) than placebo (5.95%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .36 to 1.29). The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and increased over time. Neither ivermectin nor fluvoxamine showed effect over placebo.

Conclusions

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2, metformin significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which may explain the clinical benefits in this trial. Metformin is pleiotropic with other actions that are relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^46484b3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential biases in the review process

This review aimed to provide a complete and updated evidence profile for ivermectin with regard to efficacy and safety for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and treatment of COVID‐19 based on current Cochrane standards (Higgins 2020a).

The review team was part of the German research project 'CEOsys' (COVID‐19 Evidence‐Ecosystem) until 31 December 2021. CEOsys is a consortium of clinical and methodological experts supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to synthesize clinical evidence during this global pandemic. The medical information specialists of this consortium carried out a rigorous search of electronic databases, including preprint servers and clinical trial registries, to identify the complete extent of published and ongoing trials on this topic. Additionally, we screened reference lists of included trials and compared our search results with those from the living network meta‐analysis (e.g. COVID‐NMA Working Group). Considering it a justifiable compromise between being as up to date as possible in the dynamic of this pandemic and reasons of practicability, we set February 2022 the deadline for inclusion of newly published trial results for this review update. Hence, after initially closing the trial pool for this review update, we identified one trial with more than 1000 participants, previously classified as ongoing, that published its results in March 2022. Therefore, we are confident that we have identified all relevant trials, and we continue to monitor ongoing trials, as well as full publication of preprints closely, following the publication of this review update.

### COVID-19 therapeutics: use, mechanism of action, and toxicity (xenobiotics) [^c9df9100]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and led to the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts to develop therapeutics against SARS-Cov-2 led to both new treatments and attempts to repurpose existing medications. Here, we provide a narrative review of the xenobiotics and alternative remedies used or proposed to treat COVID-19. Most repositioned xenobiotics have had neither the feared toxicity nor the anticipated efficacy. Repurposed viral replication inhibitors are not efficacious and frequently associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Antiviral medications designed specifically against SARS-CoV-2 may prevent progression to severe disease in at-risk individuals and appear to have a wide therapeutic index. Colloidal silver, zinc, and ivermectin have no demonstrated efficacy. Ivermectin has a wide therapeutic index but is not efficacious and acquiring it from veterinary sources poses additional danger. Chloroquine has a narrow therapeutic index and no efficacy. A companion review covers vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapies. Together, these two reviews form an update to our 2020 review.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^e55a5630]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action, explained above, suggests an inhibitory effect on virus replication in the early stages of the disease, indicating a benefit especially for people with mild or moderate disease. This has also led to the idea of the possible preventive potency of ivermectin on infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 in individuals after exposure to a contagious contact, called postexposure prophylaxis. In response to the early promising in vitro studies on ivermectin, mentioned above, several COVID‐19 clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of ivermectin.

Why it is important to do this review

Ivermectin is an inexpensive and widely used medicine, mainly in low‐ and middle‐income countries with a high burden of parasitic diseases. The recently published in vitro studies, especially the results of Caly 2020, have led to great interest in ivermectin in many countries with high numbers of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, including the USA and countries of South America and Asia. In South America in particular, people started liberally self‐medicating with ivermectin, and the drug has become part of public health policies without reliable scientific data. For example, in May 2020, Bolivian and Peruvian health officials recommended ivermectin for the treatment of COVID‐19 without supplying evidence. In Brazil, it was promoted as a preventive measure by municipalities (Rodríguez‐Mega 2020). Due to the rapid increase in interest in ivermectin and the risk of abuse, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) discouraged the use of ivermectin intended for animals (FDA 2020).

### The approved dose of ivermectin alone is not the ideal dose for the treatment of COVID-19 [^0d0e9f2a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The in vitro studies showing that ivermectin inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2were conducted at concentrations that were substantially higher than predicted plasma and lung concentrations in humans receiving the approved dose of ivermectin. Therefore, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. If a clinical trial is conducted, a well‐controlled dose‐response study should be considered and the feasibility of ivermectin as an inhaled treatment should be evaluated.

A first step would be to conduct the in vitro study reported by Caly et al.evaluating whether other antivirals can potentiate ivermectin's inhibition of SARS‐COV‐2 to identify whether an ivermectin concentration of 0.1 μM (rather than 5 μM) with a concomitant antiviral can inhibit SARS‐COV‐2. Repurposing drugs for use in the treatment of COVID‐19 is an ideal strategy but is only feasible if the safety of the product use has been established at the dose levels that produce efficacy. Therefore, in vitro experiments of repurposed drugs should be conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.

### Is ivermectin ready to be part of a public health policy for COVID-19 prophylaxis? [^ddf6d57c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide time trial in search for therapeutic alternatives that would be effective, safe, and accessible. The despair of front-line physicians in the face of the increment in mortality led to the empirical use of various therapies in a sort of "war medicine". Most of the studies evaluating the efficacy of multiple therapeutic options have been carried out mainly in hospitalized patients with severe or critical illness. Most treatments have proved to be ineffective or partially effective at these stages.

To date, more than 100 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, and the pandemic is not close to a control despite all the efforts. Public health interventions have included biosafety measures and lockdowns that have resulted in high socioeconomic impact. Honduras, a Central American country, is facing that impact, with disadvantage due to the lack of effective health surveillance methods, and a weak public health system. Recently, several groups of physicians and multidisciplinary committees have recommended the Honduran government to establish a new public health policy to administer weekly doses of 12 to 18 mg of ivermectin massively to the healthy adult population. The argument is that there are clinical and laboratory study results that justify its use for prophylaxis and to lower the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.

### Anti-inflammatory activity of ivermectin in late-stage COVID-19 may reflect activation of systemic glycine receptors [^bb3a101b]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

It is therefore suggested that the clinical utility of ivermectin in the cytokine storm phase of COVID-19 reflects, at least in part, an anti-inflammatory effect mediated by increased activation of glycine receptors on leukocytes and possibly vascular endothelium. An evident corollary of this is that ingestion of high-dose glycine may provide somewhat analogous anti-inflammatory protection in COVID-19, as has previously been suggested.

However, in light of accumulating evidence that ivermectin may have important utility for the primary prevention of COVID-19, it is likely that it also exerts an antiviral effect with respect to SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by in vitro studies. It is not clear whether glycine receptor agonism might have anything to do with this effect.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^8c997595]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Ivermectin — mechanistic rationale and empirical use in COVID-19 — is described as an anti-parasitic agent that is FDA-approved for onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis and is used off-label for the treatment of many parasitic infections, and although it has in vitro activity against some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, it has no proven therapeutic utility. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 requires concentrations considerably higher than those achieved in human plasma and lung tissue to reach the in vitro IC50, and ivermectin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in in vitro and in vivo studies hence hypothesized to have a mechanism beyond its anti-viral effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Since ivermectin is generally well tolerated, it was empirically evaluated in uncontrolled studies for COVID-19, alone and in combination with other off-label medications.

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c19772ef]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Ivermectin is approved by the food and drug administration for the long-term treatment of parasitic diseases. Ivermectin is deemed to be a promising effective chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection in several studies. Even though three meta-analysesdemonstrated the effectiveness of prophylactic ivermectin, the evidence was of low certainty due to few included trials and high risk of bias. Our pooled estimate of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 infection with large heterogeneity between studies did not show this statistically significant association, which is in line with the advice from European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2021 against the use of ivermectin for prevention of COVID-19 outside RCTs. Nevertheless, this advice from the EMA only referred to limited number of articles on prophylaxis with low certainty of evidence and inconsistencies, which were common in ivermectin trials. Therefore, a robust and definite meta-analysis is needed to further aggregate more evidence of ivermectin from well-designed RCTs and observational studies to draw conclusions whether ivermectin is effective in COVID-19 prevention.

Methods for future updates

Living systematic review considerations

Our information specialist (MIM) will provide us with new search records each week, which two review authors will screen, extract, evaluate, and integrate following the guidance for Cochrane living systematic reviews (Cochrane LSR).

We will manually check platform trials for new treatment arms investigating ivermectin.

We will wait until the accumulating evidence changes our conclusions of the implications of research and practice before republishing the review. We will consider one or more of the following components to inform this decision.

The findings of one or more prioritized outcomes.
The credibility (e.g. GRADE rating) of one or more prioritized outcomes.
New settings, populations, interventions, comparisons, or outcomes studied.

In case of emerging policy relevance because of global controversies around the intervention, we will consider republishing an updated review even though our conclusions remain unchanged. We will review the review scope and methods approximately monthly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in COVID‐19 research (e.g. when additional comparisons, interventions, subgroups, or outcomes, or new review methods become available).

### Is ivermectin ready to be part of a public health policy for COVID-19 prophylaxis? [^c999fb3f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ivermectin has been extensively used as antiparasitic, approved by the FDA and other agencies to be administered in a single dose of 200 mcg/kg to treat onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis, and lymphatic filaria, among other parasitoses. A study by Caly et al. reported that ivermectin inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and suggested to develop further investigation in vivo. Some argue that the existing clinical series support safety and effectiveness, but doses and posology vary between studies and controversies remain, making it necessary to develop more research with improved methodology, controlling for confounding variables.

The most recent study on ivermectin is a pilot clinical trial by Chaccour et al.who found no significant differences in detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs at days four and seven after treating with a single oral dose of 400 mcg/Kg of ivermectin (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). All patients were young adults with non-severe COVID-19, no risk factors and no more than 72 h from symptom onsets. Despite this negative result, there seemed to be a tendency to reduce viral load and an early recovery from hyposmia/anosmia in the treated group. Adverse events were not statistically significant, and authors suggest evaluating ivermectin for early COVID-19 treatment and as pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups.

Ivermectin dosing and study heterogeneity — hospitalized and ambulatory COVID-19 populations: evidence reported a range of doses (100 mcg/kg/day to 400 mcg/kg/day) and durations (one day up to seven days); among hospitalized studies, substantial heterogeneity was observed and introduced by one study, with Ahmed 2020 using five days rather than one day; excluding Ahmed 2020, any meaningful reduction in viral clearance was still not demonstrated by the summary estimate, and heterogeneity was not observed for other outcomes; randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had high risk of bias in two trials due to unsuccessful randomization (odd/even day or registration allocation and assigning all critically ill to the ivermectin arm), and across many RCTs lack of blinding could over- or under-estimate treatment effects, particularly for subjective outcomes.

### The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^72f9569d]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at concentrations not readily achievable with currently approved doses. There is limited evidence to support its clinical use in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a Pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of ivermectin reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when administered early after disease onset.

Methods

Consecutive patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for complicated disease attending the emergency room of the Clínica Universidad de Navarra between July 31, 2020 and September 11, 2020 were enrolled. All enrollments occurred within 72 h of onset of fever or cough. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ivermectin, 400 mcg/kg, single dose (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. The primary outcome was supported by determination of the viral load and infectivity of each sample. The differences between ivermectin and placebo were calculated using Fisher's exact test and presented as a relative risk ratio. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04390022.

Findings

All patients recruited completed the trial (median age, 26 [IQR 19–36 in the ivermectin and 21–44 in the controls] years; 12 [50%] women; 100% had symptoms at recruitment, 70% reported headache, 62% reported fever, 50% reported general malaise and 25% reported cough). At day 7, there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positive patients (RR 0·92, 95% CI: 0·77–1·09, p = 1·0). The ivermectin group had non-statistically significant lower viral loads at day 4 (p = 0·24 for gene E; p = 0·18 for gene N) and day 7 (p = 0·16 for gene E; p = 0·18 for gene N) post treatment as well as lower IgG titers at day 21 post treatment (p = 0·24). Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001).

Interpretation

Among patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for severe disease receiving a single 400 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin within 72 h of fever or cough onset there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positives. There was however a marked reduction of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia, a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower IgG titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^17a109ee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

For the outpatient setting, the relevant outcome of admission to hospital or death as well as quality of life, that were not reported by any trial in the previous review version, could be evaluated in this update. Overall, for all the outcomes relevant for outpatients with mild disease, such as risk of needing hospitalization, resolving symptoms, adverse or serious adverse events and viral clearance, ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect neither for improving nor worsening the respective outcome. The certainty of evidence for all of those findings was low. With high certainty, we found that ivermectin showed no effect on quality of life for the outpatient setting.

No trial investigated ivermectin for the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Hence, no evidence could be found for postexposure prophylaxis in this matter.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

First, with the new outcome set in this update, we mainly addressed the issue of competing outcome risk. We combined outcomes that represent clinical worsening with the outcome of death which would allow evidence on ivermectin to become more unambiguous and patient‐relevant.

Four newly‐included trials for the outpatient setting increased certainty of evidence on ivermectin for this purpose compared to the previous review version. Overall, the included trials investigated participants with COVID‐19 at WHO 1 to 3 and WHO 4 to 5. Therefore, findings of this review are transferable to patients with COVID‐19 at mild to moderate stages. In this update, no trials investigated ivermectin for severe COVID‐19 (WHO 6 to 9). Considering the proposed mode of action, no effect of the drug would be expected if given at such a late stage of the disease. Hence, we do not consider this to be an evidence gap that needs to be closed. Moreover, with few exceptions, most included trials reported treatment initiation within a mean of 5 days after symptom onset, which is in line with the propagated hypothesis of ivermectin's inhibitory effect on virus replication in early stages of the disease.

### Ivermectin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4edcf70e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (IVM) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of IVM on adult patients with COVID-19 were searched until 22 March 2021 in 5 engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), and adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs (SAEs). The risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed, with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methods.

Results

Ten RCTs (n = 1173) were included. The controls were the standard of care in 5 RCTs and placebo in 5. COVID-19 disease severity was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in 1, and mild and moderate in 1. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality rates compared with controls (relative risk [RR], 0.37 [95% confidence interval, .12–1.13]; very low QoE) or LOS compared with controls (mean difference, 0.72 days [95% confidence interval, -.86 to 2.29 days]; very low QoE). AEs, SAEs, and viral clearance were similar between IVM and control groups (low QoE for all outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality rates in 3 RCTs at high RoB were reduced with IVM.

Conclusions

Compared with the standard of care or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, LOS, or viral clearance in RCTs in patients with mostly mild COVID-19. IVM did not have an effect on AEs or SAEs and is not a viable option to treat patients with COVID-19.

Ivermectin.

Given its wide safety margin, ivermectin has been used broadly in mass distribution campaigns to treat illnesses such as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. More recently, it has been found to limit infection by dengue virus, West Nile Virus, and influenza, with antiviral activity attributed to inhibition of RNA virus interactions with host nuclear transport proteins. Ivermectin has been tested in vitro against SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating reduction in viral RNA in infected cells. However, concentrations needed to achieve viral activity appear to be much higher than what standard doses can achieve in serum. Nonetheless, the drug can concentrate to higher levels in lung. An early trial demonstrated a 5-day course of ivermectin in adult patients with mild COVID-19 was safe and decreased time to virological clearance compared with placebo (9.7 versus 12.7 days, P = 0.02). However, a subsequent, larger RCT in 476 patients with mild COVID-19 failed to show any difference in time to resolution of symptoms with a 5-day course of ivermectin compared with placebo. In a trial of 400 patients, those given ivermectin with doxycycline versus placebo recovered earlier, were less likely to progress to more serious disease, and were more likely to be COVID-19 negative by reverse transcriptase PCR on day 14. Larger, randomized, and blinded trials are needed to fully evaluate its role in COVID-19 management. Lastly, ivermectin's benefit in COVID-19 treatment could be attributed to preventing Strongyloides hyperinfection in patients treated with dexamethasone. Because Strongyloides stercoralis is hyperendemic in many LMICs, this could significantly reduce morbidity.

### Pharmacological interventions to prevent COVID-19 disease: a rapid review [^fd742607]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The aim of this rapid review was to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions (excluding vaccines) to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) or reduce the severity of disease. A systematic search of published peer-reviewed articles and non-peer-reviewed pre-prints was undertaken from 1 January 2020 to 17 August 2021. Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one non-RCT were included; three trials (two RCTs and one non-RCT) tested ivermectin with or without carrageenan. While all reported some potential protective effect of ivermectin, these trials had a high risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was deemed to be 'very low'. One RCT tested bamlanivimab compared to placebo and reported a significantly reduced incidence of Covid-19 in the intervention group; this trial had a low risk of bias however the certainty of evidence was deemed 'very low'. The fifth RCT tested casirivimab plus imdevimab versus placebo and reported that the combination of monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral load, duration of symptomatic disease and the duration of a high viral load; this trial was deemed to have a low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was 'low'. The designations 'low' and 'very low' regarding the certainty of evidence indicate that the estimate of effect is uncertain and therefore is unsuitable for informing decision-making. At the time of writing, there is insufficient high quality evidence to support the use of pharmacological interventions to prevent Covid-19.

### Ivermectin: a mini-review [^b74462e3]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Avermectins are common antiparasitic drugs, derived from Streptomyces bacteria that exhibit activity against arthropods and nematodes. Ivermectin, an avermectin derivative, is used as a treatment for parasitic infections in humans and domesticated animals. Discussion: Ivermectin's mechanism of action involves binding to ligand-gated ion channel receptors including glutamate, GABA, and glycine, resulting in parasitic paralysis and death. Due to varying expression of these ion channel receptors in vertebrate species, ivermectin toxicity is rarely reported in mammals. Ivermectin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which limits its neurological toxicity in humans. Genetic polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein or coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors may increase the neurotoxicity of ivermectin. Other toxic effects of ivermectin after therapeutic oral use include edema, rash, headache, and ocular complaints. Most of these effects are mild and short in duration. Ivermectin exhibits antiviral effects in-vitro at very high concentrations. This has led to suggestions of ivermectin as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, although the drug's pharmacokinetic parameters reduce the likelihood that high concentrations of the drug can be achieved in-vivo. Conclusion: Due to concern for adverse events, specifically neurotoxicity, as well as a paucity of supporting evidence, the use of ivermectin as a routine treatment or preventive measure for COVID-19 infection is not recommended at this time.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^82a5da00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Another limitation for the certainty of evidence was the low number of participants, or events, or both, leading to wide CIs and high uncertainty of the estimated effects. All outcomes included in the summary of findings tables were downgraded one or two levels for imprecision.

Heterogeneity was rarely a reason to downgrade the certainty of evidence. This is mainly due to the small number of studies per meta‐analysis. The only outcome with high heterogeneity (I 2 = 77%) included in the summary of findings tables was viral clearance at day seven in an inpatient setting. Two studies with conflicting results, one favouring ivermectin (Ahmed 2020), and one showing no important difference between ivermectin and placebo (Mohan 2021), caused the high statistical heterogeneity.

We did not downgrade any of the outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for indirectness. In all cases, the effect estimates were based on comparisons of interest, on the population of interest, and on outcomes of interest.

In the current phase of the pandemic, it is impossible to reliably assess the risk of publication bias. Most of the registered studies are still ongoing or, in the case of a completed study status, their results have not yet been published. We will follow the publication and trial history of each ongoing study and study awaiting classification. Currently, we did not suspect publication bias for any outcome included in this review. However, this may change in updates of this review.

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8268f021]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our review provided an exhaustive summary of the effectiveness of all potential drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 prevention. Potential preventive effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in some studies of HCQ, ivermectin, ACEi or ARB, statin, carvedilol, beta-blocker, warfarin, doxycycline, and bamlanivimab etc in this review, nevertheless, current evidence is inadequate to make a solid advocacy policy for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis, especially in the absence of careful drug safety assessment. According to our meta-analysis results, even though a significant association was observed between HCQ prophylaxis and decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, this finding is primarily driven by favourable results from one single clinical trial. Ivermectin, ACEi, and ARB did not significantly reduce the risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the view of scarce supportive evidence on repurposing drugs for COVID-19, the use of these repurposed drugs is not recommended as prophylaxis for COVID-19 in the clinical settings. Alternative strategies such as immunisation of vulnerable people are warranted to prevent the future waves of infection.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^a102a0bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the pace of the pandemic, it is important and welcome to make new scientific findings immediately available. But non‐peer‐reviewed results have to be handled with care and should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decisions and recommendations. Methodological limitations in the design of original trials, data integrity, and potential conflicts of interests have to be critically appraised when judging trial results. Many reviews and meta‐analyses of ivermectin for COVID‐19 are unreliable due to methodological inaccuracies and insufficient quality (Popp 2021d).

As of January 2022, the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for COVID‐19 treatment and prophylaxis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are still subject to debate. The most recent guideline from the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) stands by its recommendation against the use of ivermectin as antiviral treatment (German AWMF Guideline 2021a), while the Peruvian ministry of health removed its previous positive recommendation for the use of ivermectin entirely from its guideline (The Guardian 2021b). In February 2021, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) revised its COVID‐19 treatment guidelines from a recommendation 'against the use of ivermectin' to 'cannot recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin', giving clinicians leeway in individual case decision‐making (NIH 2021). The WHO recommends the drug should only be used within clinical trials, as current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat people with COVID‐19 is inconclusive (WHO 2021b).

This review aimed to provide a complete evidence profile, based on current Cochrane standards, for ivermectin with regard to efficacy and safety for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and treatment of COVID‐19. As this review (Popp 2021b), and the other reviews of the Cochrane Living Systematic Reviews Series on different interventions for COVID‐19 (Ansems 2021; Kreuzberger 2021; Mikolajewska 2021; Popp 2021c; Stroehlein 2021; Wagner 2021) are living systematic reviews during the COVID‐19 pandemic, specific adaptions related to the research question, including participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and methods were necessary for this update. We have transparently reported relevant protocol changes between the review and update in the section Differences between protocol and review.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only, as this is the best trial design for evaluating the efficacy of interventions (Higgins 2020a). Non‐standard RCT designs, such as cluster‐randomized and cross‐over trials, were not eligible for the review (Higgins 2020b). These designs are not appropriate in this context, since the underlying cause of COVID‐19 is an infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and the medical condition evolves over time.

We included full‐text journal articles published in PubMed‐indexed and non‐indexed journals, preprint articles, results published in trials registers, and abstract publications. We applied no restrictions on the language of publication of the articles. All trials, especially preprint articles that have not been peer‐reviewed, must have reported robust and valid data on trial design, participants' characteristics, interventions, and outcomes, to be eligible for inclusion.

For research integrity, we further assessed all trials meeting eligibility criteria using a tool developed by our group to deal with problematic trials (see Selection of studies).

Types of participants

Treatment of COVID‐19

We included trials investigating participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (RT‐PCR or antigen testing), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatients and outpatients). If trials included participants with a confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis, we used only the data for the patient population with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis. In cases, where data were not reported separately for people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis, we excluded the trial.

Prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

We included trials investigating participants who were not infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 at enrolment, but were at high risk of developing the infection (e.g. after high‐risk exposure), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatient and outpatients). Participants may have been hospitalized for reasons other than COVID‐19. Eligible trials must have reported the history of previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infections or serological evidence and the vaccination status in included participants. A history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or vaccination was not an exclusion criterion.

We excluded trials investigating ivermectin for prevention and treatment of other viral diseases.

We included studies investigating participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (RT‐PCR or antigen testing), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatients and outpatients). If studies included participants with a confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis, we used only the data for the patient population with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis. In cases, where data were not reported separately for people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis, we excluded the study.

Prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

We included studies investigating participants who were not infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 at enrolment, but were at high risk of developing the infection (e.g. after high‐risk exposure), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatient and outpatients). Participants may have been hospitalized for reasons other than COVID‐19. Eligible trials must have reported the history of previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infections or serological evidence in included participants. A history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was not an exclusion criterion.

We excluded studies investigating ivermectin for prevention and treatment of other viral diseases.

Methods for future updates

Living systematic review considerations

Our information specialist (MIM) provided us with a weekly monitoring of published RCTs up to and including February 2022. From April onwards we will change this list to a monthly monitoring schedule, which two review authors will screen, extract, evaluate, and integrate following the guidance for Cochrane living systematic reviews (Cochrane LSR).

We will manually check platform trials for new treatment arms investigating ivermectin.

We will wait until the accumulating evidence changes our conclusions of the implications for research and practice before republishing the review. We will consider one or more of the following components to inform this decision.

The findings of one or more prioritized outcomes.
The credibility (e.g. GRADE rating) of one or more prioritized outcomes.
New settings, populations, interventions, comparisons, or outcomes studied.

In case of emerging policy relevance due to global controversies around the intervention, we will consider republishing an updated review even though our conclusions remain unchanged. We will review the scope and methods of the review approximately monthly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in COVID‐19 research (e.g. when additional comparisons, interventions, subgroups, or outcomes, or new review methods become available).

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^2b0db88b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

The primary analysis included only those studies that had low risk or some concerns of bias according to the RoB 2 assessment. We included high risk of bias studies in a secondary analysis to assess the impact on the results (Sensitivity analysis).

We analyzed trials with different intentions of ivermectin use and different participant populations separately, as follows.

Treatment of COVID‐19 in an inpatient setting: participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
Treatment of COVID‐19 in an outpatient setting: participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
Prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (postexposure prophylaxis): participants at high risk of developing the infection.

We created these comparisons.

Ivermectin versus placebo or standard of care.
Ivermectin versus active pharmacological intervention with proven efficacy.

We performed meta‐analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2020).

If clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies were sufficiently homogeneous, we pooled the data in meta‐analyses. When meta‐analysis was feasible, we used the random‐effects model as we assumed that the intervention effects were related but were not the same for the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we performed meta‐analyses using the Mantel‐Haenszel method under a random‐effects model to calculate the summary (combined) intervention effect estimate as a weighted mean of the intervention effects estimated in the individual studies. For continuous outcomes, we used the inverse‐variance method.

We used RevMan Web software for meta‐analyses (RevMan Web 2020).

### A living WHO guideline on drugs for COVID-19 [^a8fd55ad]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Updates

This is the fourteenth version (thirteenth update) of the living guideline, replacing earlier versions (available as data supplements). New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.

Clinical Question

What is the role of drugs in the treatment of patients with covid-19?

Context

The evidence base for therapeutics for covid-19 is evolving with numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recently completed and underway. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants are changing the role of therapeutics.

What Is New?

The guideline development group (GDG) defined 1.5% as a new threshold for an important reduction in risk of hospitalisation in patients with non-severe covid-19. Combined with updated baseline risk estimates, this resulted in stratification into patients at low, moderate, and high risk for hospitalisation. New recommendations were added for moderate risk of hospitalisation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and for moderate and low risk of hospitalisation for molnupiravir and remdesivir. New pharmacokinetic evidence was included for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir, supporting existing recommendations for patients at high risk of hospitalisation. The recommendation for ivermectin in patients with non-severe illness was updated in light of additional trial evidence which reduced the high degree of uncertainty informing previous guidance. A new recommendation was made against the antiviral agent VV116 for patients with non-severe and with severe or critical illness outside of randomised clinical trials based on one RCT comparing the drug with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The structure of the guideline publication has also been changed; recommendations are now ordered by severity of covid-19.

About This Guideline

This living guideline from the World Health Organization (WHO) incorporates new evidence to dynamically update recommendations for covid-19 therapeutics. The GDG typically evaluates a therapy when the WHO judges sufficient evidence is available to make a recommendation. While the GDG takes an individual patient perspective in making recommendations, it also considers resource implications, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and human rights. This guideline was developed according to standards and methods for trustworthy guidelines, making use of an innovative process to achieve efficiency in dynamic updating of recommendations. The methods are aligned with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development and according to a pre-approved protocol (planning proposal) by the Guideline Review Committee (GRC). A box at the end of the article outlines key methodological aspects of the guideline process. MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provides methodological support, including the coordination of living systematic reviews with network meta-analyses to inform the recommendations. The full version of the guideline is available online in MAGICapp and in PDF on the WHO website, with a summary version here in The BMJ. These formats should facilitate adaptation, which is strongly encouraged by WHO to contextualise recommendations in a healthcare system to maximise impact.

Future Recommendations

Recommendations on anticoagulation are planned for the next update to this guideline. Updated data regarding systemic corticosteroids, azithromycin, favipiravir and umefenovir for non-severe illness, and convalescent plasma and statin therapy for severe or critical illness, are planned for review in upcoming guideline iterations.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^4e295db1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

One in vitro study showed that ivermectin can inhibit replication of HIV‐1, via inhibition of the interaction of virus proteins and a human cargo protein complex called importin (IMPα/β1) (Wagstaff 2012). Importin is used by viruses for nuclear import in order to initiate their replication process (Wagstaff 2012). Besides HIV‐1, various other RNA viruses use importin as target protein, among them dengue virus, West Nile virus, and influenza. Several research groups have investigated ivermectin's efficiency on those pathogens (Goetz 2016; Tay 2013; Yang 2020). Although ivermectin showed some inhibitory potential for virus replication in vitro, there is no evidence of clinical effectiveness to date.

Before the COVID‐19 pandemic, only two clinical trials had been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov using ivermectin as an intervention for treatment of viral diseases. Only one of these had published results (Yamasmith 2018). In this small, single‐centre trial published as a conference abstract, ivermectin showed a shorter viral protein clearance time compared to placebo in people infected with dengue virus (Yamasmith 2018).

Another member of the beta‐coronavirus family, SARS‐CoV‐1, which also causes respiratory failure, revealed similar dependence on the IMPα/β1 interaction (Wulan 2015). The pathogen causing COVID‐19, SARS‐CoV‐2, is also a RNA virus closely related to SARS‐CoV‐1. In 2020, ivermectin gained much interest as a promising therapeutic option against SARS‐CoV‐2, when Caly 2020 published their experimental study results showing that ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in cell culture. This observation has led to ivermectin being suggested as a potential antiviral agent that could prevent infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 completely or at least the progression to severe COVID‐19. However, until showing success in human clinical trials with patient‐relevant outcomes, these findings remain suggestive.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^653a025e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The increased research interest in ivermectin has led to the registration of numerous trials in clinical trials registries worldwide. As of 2 July 2021, there were 73 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov investigating ivermectin in various settings.

Several studies describe ivermectin's positive effect on resolution of mild COVID‐19 symptoms or describe a reduction of inflammatory marker levels or shorter time to viral clearance, while other studies indicate no effect or even a negative effect on disease progression. Many studies are already summarized in existing systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, and guidelines (Bryant 2021; Hill 2021; NIH 2021). It has to be kept in mind that many available meta‐analyses and reviews, as well as most of the underlying original studies, have not yet been published in peer‐reviewed journals and are only available on preprint servers without any supervising authority. Given the pace of the pandemic, it is important and welcome to make new scientific findings immediately available. But non‐peer‐reviewed results have to be handled with care and should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decisions and recommendations. Methodological limitations in the design of original studies, data integrity, and potential conflicts of interests have to be critically appraised when judging trial results. Many reviews and meta‐analyses of ivermectin for COVID‐19 are not reliable due to insufficient methodological accuracy and quality.

As of July 2021, the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for COVID‐19 treatment and prophylaxis are still subject to debate. The most recent Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) guideline recommends against the use of ivermectin as antiviral treatment (German AWMF Guideline 2021), while in February 2021, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) revised their COVID‐19 treatment guidelines from a recommendation 'against the use of ivermectin' to 'cannot recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin', giving clinicians leeway in individual case decision‐making (NIH 2021). The WHO recommends that the drug only be used within clinical trials as current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat people with COVID‐19 is inconclusive (WHO 2021b).

This review aimed to provide a complete evidence profile, based on current Cochrane standards, for ivermectin with regard to efficacy and safety for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID‐19.

Potential biases in the review process

This review aimed to provide a complete evidence profile for ivermectin with regard to efficacy and safety for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID‐19 based on current Cochrane standards (Higgins 2020a).

The review team is part of the German research project 'CEOsys' (COVID‐19 Evidence‐Ecosystem). CEOsys is a consortium of clinical and methodological experts supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to synthesize clinical evidence during this global pandemic. The involved medical information specialists of this consortium carried out a rigorous search of electronic databases including preprint servers and clinical trial registries to identify the complete extent of published and ongoing trials on this topic. Additionally, we compared our search results with those from 'living' meta‐analysis and reviews (COVID‐NMA Working Group; ivmmeta.com). Therefore, we are confident that we identified all relevant studies and are monitoring ongoing studies as well as full publication of preprints closely after the publication of this review.

Five studies were preprint articles. We are aware that articles may change following peer‐review. Nevertheless, we are convinced that including all eligible data in a highly dynamic situation such as the COVID‐19 pandemic is crucial to be up‐to‐date and to provide timely information on potentially promising treatment options. Journal publications and corresponding preprint articles were compared in terms of consistency and all study results were assessed for their risk of bias.

The immense amount of ongoing RCTs reflects the persistent lack of clarity on this intervention and the need for an update of this review. It should be considered that conclusions of the updated version differ from those of the present review. Review updates may allow for a more concise judgement of the effectiveness and the safety of ivermectin for treatment and prevention of COVID‐19.

### Trust, transparency, and translation: how clinical pharmacologists can strengthen public confidence in pandemic responses-commentary on schmith et al [^0ff97366]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

On April 3, 2020, data were published showing in vitro efficacy of ivermectin against COVID-19. By April 26, 2020, Schmith et al. published that even at supratherapeutic doses, ivermectin was unlikely to reach target IC90 concentrations in vivo. Nevertheless, many countries adopted ivermectin, and millions of patients received treatment even after definitive evidence of ineffectiveness became available. The ivermectin debate catalyzed public mistrust in science and health authorities and has consequences for future pandemic preparedness.

### Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 virus: a narrative review and bibliometric analysis [^e97dd45d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 epidemic has become a major international health emergency. Millions of people have died as a result of this phenomenon since it began. Has there been any successful pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 since the initial report on the virus? How many searches are undertaken to address the impact of the infection? What is the number of drugs that have undergone investigation? What are the mechanisms of action and adverse effects associated with the investigated pharmaceuticals used to treat COVID-19? Has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved any medication to treat COVID-19? To date, our understanding is based on a restricted corpus of published investigations into the treatment of COVID-19. It is important to note that no single study comprehensively encompasses all pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. This paper provides an introductory summary of a bibliometric analysis conducted on the data about COVID-19, sourced explicitly from two platforms, namely PubMed and ScienceDirect. The analysis encompasses the period spanning from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, this study examines the published literature about the pharmacological interventions for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), explicitly focusing on the safety and effectiveness of different medications such as Remdesivir (marketed as Veklury®), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (commercially known as Kaletra® or Aluvia®), Ribavirin, Favipiravir (marketed as Avigan®), Ivermectin, Casirivimab and Imdevimab (branded as Ronapreve®), Sotrovimab (marketed as Xevudy®), Anakinra, Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid®), and Galidesivir. Findings indicate that while Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir show significant efficacy in reducing hospitalization and severe outcomes, drugs like Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Ivermectin have inconsistent results. Our insights suggest a multifaceted approach incorporating these therapies can significantly improve patient outcomes. Repurposing drugs has been critical in rapidly responding to COVID-19, allowing existing medications to be used in new ways to combat the virus. Combination therapies and further research are essential to optimize treatment strategies.

In 2020, ivermectin gained high interest as a promising therapeutic option against SARS‐CoV‐2, when Caly 2020 published their experimental study results showing that ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in cell culture. So far, the only drugs shown to be clearly effective in COVID‐19 treatment are targeting the immune response to a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; for example, dexamethasone (RECOVERY 2021). Therefore, ivermectin's potential to restrict the disease's progression, or even its outbreak, indicates that it is possibly an effective antiviral agent. However, until showing success in human clinical trials with patient‐relevant outcomes, these findings remain suggestive.

COVID-19 ivermectin efficacy — treatment with ivermectin failed to demonstrate a beneficial or detrimental effect on hospitalization or viral clearance at day seven, and the evidence regarding time to recovery among ambulatory persons is very uncertain while one trial did not show a reduction. Treatment with ivermectin failed to demonstrate a beneficial or detrimental effect on hospitalization or viral clearance at day seven (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.11, moderate CoE, and RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.31; very low CoE, respectively). The evidence is very uncertain due to the inclusion of one study without appropriate randomization, but ivermectin may reduce the time to recovery among ambulatory persons with COVID-19 (mean difference: 2.99 days fewer; 95% CI: 4.76 to 1.22 days fewer; very low CoE). However, the ACTIV-6 trial did not show a reduction in time to recovery with a hazard ratio: 1.09 (0.98, 1.22).

### Effectiveness and safety of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients: a prospective study at a safety-net hospital [^42f2dc54]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ivermectin has been found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in vitro. It is unknown whether this inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication correlates with improved clinical outcomes. To assess the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 286 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Univariate analysis of the primary mortality outcome and comparisons between treatment groups were determined. Logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for confounders. Patients in the ivermectin group received 2 doses of Ivermectin at 200μg/kg in addition to usual clinical care on hospital Days 1 and 3. The ivermectin group had a significantly higher length of hospital stay than the control group; however, this significance did not maintain on multivariable logistic regression analysis. The length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were longer in the control group. However, a mortality benefit was not seen with ivermectin treatment before and after PSM (p values = 0.07 and 0.11, respectively). ICU admission, and intubation rate were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.49, and p = 1.0, respectively). No differences were found between groups regarding the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, intubation rate, and in-hospital mortality.

### The approved dose of ivermectin alone is not the ideal dose for the treatment of COVID-19 [^6a51875d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Caly et al. 1 reported that ivermectin inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro for up to 48 hours using ivermectin at 5 μM. The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC 50; 2 µM) was > 35× higher than the maximum plasma concentration (C max) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total C max was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung C max after administration of each single dose. Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC 50, even for a dose level 10× higher than the approved dose. Even with the high lung:plasma ratio, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC 50 in the lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0873 µM) or at doses 10× higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.820 µM). In summary, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro. Repurposing drugs for use in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of repurposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.

Ivermectin — evidence search, eligibility, and study counts — identified 28 studies in patients with COVID-19 with ages ranging between 8 and 86 years that reported on the outcomes of mortality, symptom resolution, viral clearance, and adverse events, and informed the evidence review for inpatient and outpatient therapy; eligible studies compared treatment with ivermectin against a placebo or standard of care, while studies comparing ivermectin to a non-placebo, active comparison or that did not provide a comparison arm were not included. Several studies did not meet eligibility for inclusion in this review, including Three trials compared ivermectin to hydroxychloroquine (comparison to treatment with evidence of harm); two trials examined ivermectin as prophylactic treatment; and two trials did not provide study data in a peer-reviewed, published, or pre-print manuscript. The studies that informed the recommendations for hospitalized patients included 15 randomized control trials (RCTs), and Sixteen RCTs informed the recommendation for ambulatory persons. Each of them compared an active treatment arm of ivermectin to an inactive comparison (e.g., standard of care with or without placebo).

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^e2653a99]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

In the previous review version, we excluded high risk of bias trials from the primary analysis, with the aim to eliminate biased data and untrustworthy trials. However, to be transparent, we presented all trials in a secondary analysis. With the introduction of our new research integrity assessment, differentiation between primary and secondary analyses based on RoB ratings became dispensable. All included trials were eligible for the main analyses which informed the summary of findings tables and concerns regarding risk of bias were met with respective sensitivity analysis (see Sensitivity analysis).

We analysed trials with different intentions of ivermectin use and different participant populations separately, as follows.

Treatment of COVID‐19 in an inpatient setting: participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
Treatment of COVID‐19 in an outpatient setting: participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
Prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (postexposure prophylaxis): participants at high risk of developing the infection (no trials available for the current review version).

We created the comparisons:

ivermectin plus standard of care versus standard of care plus/minus placebo; and
Ivermectin versus active pharmacological intervention with proven efficacy (no trials available for the current review version).

We performed meta‐analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2020). We used forest plots to visualise meta‐analyses.

If clinical and methodological characteristics of individual trials were sufficiently homogeneous, we pooled the data in meta‐analyses. When meta‐analysis was feasible, we used the random‐effects model as we assumed that the intervention effects were related but were not the same for the included trials. For dichotomous outcomes, we performed meta‐analyses using the Mantel‐Haenszel method under a random‐effects model to calculate the summary (combined) intervention effect estimate as a weighted mean of the intervention effects estimated in the individual trials. For continuous outcomes, we used the inverse‐variance method.

We planned to present descriptive statistics only if we deemed meta‐analysis inappropriate for a certain outcome because of heterogeneity or because of serious trial limitations leading to considerably high risk of bias (e.g. competing risk of death not taken into account in outcome measurement). This was not the case for the current review version.

We used RevMan Web software for meta‐analyses (RevMan Web 2020).

### Effect of early treatment with ivermectin among patients with COVID-19 [^278acdc8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study TOGETHER (ivermectin) was published by Gilmar Reis and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of early treatment with ivermectin in patients with COVID-19? In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the population was: 1358 patients (791 female, 567 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 for up to 7 days with one risk factor for disease progression. The key exclusion criteria were diagnostic test for negative COVID-19 associated with acute flu symptoms; requirement of hospitalization due to COVID-19; acute respiratory symptoms due to other causes; dyspnea secondary to other acute and chronic respiratory causes or infections. In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the interventions were: n = 679 ivermectin (400 mcg/kg of body weight once daily for 3 days) n = 679 placebo (matching placebo for 3 days). In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in hospitalization due to COVID-19 or emergency department visits due to clinical worsening of COVID-19 at 28 days (14.7% vs. 16.3%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.16). In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in viral clearance at day 7 (25.4% vs. 25.5%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46) No significant difference in hospitalization for any cause (11.6% vs. 14%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.1) No significant difference in death (3.1% vs. 3.5%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.55). In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 for up to 7 days with one risk factor for disease progression, ivermectin was not superior to placebo with respect to hospitalization due to COVID-19 or emergency department visits due to clinical worsening of COVID-19 at 28 days.

The study IVERCOR-COVID19 was published by Julio Vallejos and colleagues in 2021 in the journal BMC Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the trial question was: what is the role of ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the population was: 501 patients (237 female, 264 male). The inclusion criteria were adult outpatients with COVID-19 positive nasal swabs within 48 hours. The key exclusion criteria were current home oxygen use, hospitalization requirement for COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis, or a history of hospitalization for COVID-19. In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the interventions were: n = 250 ivermectin (a total dosage of 24–48 mg PO, based on weight) n = 251 placebo (equivalent number of matching placebo tablets). In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in hospitalization (5.6% vs. 8.4%; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.31). In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes (1.6% vs. 1.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.3 to 6.07) No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation (1.6% vs. 1.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.3 to 6.07) No significant difference in dialysis (0.4% vs. 0.4%; OR 1, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.14). In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in dialysis, adverse events, or death from all causes. significant difference in time to invasive mechanical ventilation (5.25 days vs. 10 days). In the IVERCOR-COVID19 study, the conclusion was: in adult outpatients with COVID-19 positive nasal swabs within 48 hours, ivermectin was not superior to placebo with respect to hospitalization.

### Repurposed drug studies on the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c0c40361]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Objective

Current evidence on the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis is inconclusive. We aimed to systematically evaluate published studies on repurposed drugs for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 among healthy adults.

Design

Systematic review.

Eligibility

Quantitative experimental and observational intervention studies that evaluated the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 disease.

Data Source

PubMed and Embase (1 January 2020–28 September 2022).

Risk Of Bias

Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tools were applied to assess the quality of studies.

Data Analysis

Meta-analyses for each eligible drug were performed if ≥ 2 similar study designs were available.

Results

In all, 65 (25 trials, 40 observational) and 29 publications were eligible for review and meta-analyses, respectively. Most studies pertained to hydroxychloroquine (32), ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (11), statin (8), and ivermectin (8). In trials, hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis reduced laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (risk ratio: 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90), I² = 48%), a result largely driven by one clinical trial (weight: 60.5%). Such beneficial effects were not observed in observational studies, nor for prognostic clinical outcomes. Ivermectin did not significantly reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR: 0.35 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.26), I² = 96%) and findings for clinical outcomes were inconsistent. Neither ACEi or ARB were beneficial in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of the evidence from clinical trials was of moderate quality and of lower quality in observational studies.

Conclusions

Results from our analysis are insufficient to support an evidence-based repurposed drug policy for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis because of inconsistency. In the view of scarce supportive evidence on repurposing drugs for COVID-19, alternative strategies such as immunisation of vulnerable people are warranted to prevent the future waves of infection.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^d970dae2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Another limitation for the certainty of evidence was the low number of participants, events, or both leading to wide CIs and uncertainty of the estimated effects. We downgraded all outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for inpatients one or two levels for imprecision. In the outpatient setting, the number of analysed participants increased for all outcomes in this update. This improved the quality of the evidence, especially for mortality compared to the previous review update. For the newly‐available outcome of 'quality of life', results were precise, so we could grade certainty of the evidence as high. However, due to few events resulting in wide CIs, we had to downgrade one level for imprecision for several outpatient outcomes.

Heterogeneity was no reason to downgrade the certainty of evidence for treatment of inpatients. This is mainly due to the small number of trials per meta‐analysis. In the outpatient setting, we downgraded certainty of evidence one level for serious inconsistency in three outcomes with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. Those were 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' (I 2 = 44%), 'all initial symptoms resolved at day 14' (I 2 = 57%), and 'any adverse events during the trial period' (I 2 = 80%).

We did not downgrade any of the outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for indirectness. In all cases, the effect estimates were based on comparisons of interest, on the population of interest, and on outcomes of interest. In the current phase of the pandemic, it is still difficult to reliably assess the risk of publication bias. In this update, we still did not downgrade for publication bias for any outcome. However, as explained above this will probably change in future updates of this review.

### Clinical study evaluating the efficacy of ivermectin in COVID-19 treatment: a randomized controlled study [^20ab16c5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Researchers around the world are working at record speed to find the best ways to treat and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of hospitalized mild to moderate COVID-19 infected patients. This was a randomized open-label controlled study that included 164 patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized into two groups where Group 1 (Ivermectin group) included patients who received ivermectin 12mg once daily for 3 days with standard care and Group 2 (control group) included patients who received standard protocol of treatment alone for 14 days. The main outcomes were mortality, the length of hospital stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed up for 1 month. Overall, 82 individuals were randomized to receive ivermectin plus standard of care and 82 to receive standard of care alone. Patients in the ivermectin group had a shorter length of hospital stay (8.82 ± 4.94 days) than the control group (10.97 ± 5.28 days), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.085). Three patients (3.7%) in each group required mechanical ventilation (p = 1.00). The death rate was three patients in the ivermectin group (3.7%) versus four patients (4.9%) in the control group without any significant difference between the two groups (p = 1.00). Although there was no statistically significant difference in any endpoints by ivermectin doses (12mg/day for 3 days); there was an observed trend to reducing hospital stay in the ivermectin-treated group.

### The in vitro evaluation of the activity of COVID-19 antiviral drugs against adenovirus [^e7aa9dde]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human adenovirus (HAdV) eye infections are manifested in three major forms, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis [EKC], follicular conjunctivitis, and pharyngeal conjunctival fever. These eye infections are the most seen viral eye infections around the world. Currently, no antiviral agents have received regulatory approval to treat these infections.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a great deal of attention paid by the lay media and in the scientific literature to several possible antiviral agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and umifenovir (Arbidol) have been publicized as potential COVID-19 therapies.

Remdesivir (REM) (Figure 1A) is an antiviral agent that has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. It is a monophosphoramidate nucleoside prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolic conversion to its active metabolite nucleoside triphosphate form. Remdesivir triphosphate subsequently interacts with the viral RNA polymerase resulting in chain termination during RNA synthesis. Its antiviral effect on DNA viruses is unknown.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (Figure 1B) is a synthetic antimalarial drug that was approved for use in 1955. It has been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV by an unknown mechanism of action.

Ivermectin (IVM) (Figure 1C) was approved as a treatment for parasitic infections in animals in 1981, and subsequently to treat onchocerciasis (river blindness) in humans in 1987. Antiviral activity of IVR has been shown for the RNA viruses HIV-1, influenza, flaviviruses, and SARS-CoV-2, as well the DNA viruses pseudorabies, polyomavirus, and adenovirus. King et al demonstrated that IVR inhibits HAdV-5 early gene transcription, early and late protein expression and genome replication by disrupting the binding of the viral E1A protein to Imp-α without affecting the interaction between Imp-α and Imp-β1. This study also concluded that IVR also possesses antiviral activity against HAdV-3.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^749eac06]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hill 2021 identified 18 RCTs up to December 2020 and was a preprint article. The author team used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 for critical appraisal. However, the certainty of evidence was not assessed. Six RCTs investigating people with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 were pooled for the meta‐analysis on mortality with a benefit of 75% for ivermectin (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.52). Hill 2021 compared ivermectin alone or in combination with doxycycline to control interventions, including placebo, standard of care, or hydroxychloroquine, and pooled all in one comparison. We did not include five of the six studies in our meta‐analysis on mortality of people with moderate COVID‐19, including Elgazzar 2020, Hashim 2020, Mahmud 2021, Niaee 2020, and Okumuş 2021. Hashim 2020 and Mahmud 2021 combined ivermectin with doxycycline, which makes it impossible to isolate any potential effect to the individual drugs used. Elgazzar 2020 compared ivermectin to hydroxychloroquine. The latter is not effective for the treatment of COVID‐19 and has resulted in clinical adverse effects (Singh 2021). We did not consider hydroxychloroquine an eligible comparator to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID‐19. Niaee 2020 included a population of about 30% of people who were SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative, which we did not consider appropriate to investigate SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antiviral effect of ivermectin. Okumuş 2021 compared ivermectin to an eligible comparator and investigated an eligible population, but reported mortality at an ineligible time point (e.g. on average three months). Finally, there is only one small study with broad CIs and high uncertainty for a mortality benefit (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.09), which is also included in our meta‐analysis on mortality of people with moderate COVID‐19 (Kirti 2021). However, we included mortality at day 28 rather than in‐hospital mortality, which was different in one participant who died in the control group.

### Ivermectin and mortality in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^491a1f64]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the effect of ivermectin on mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov from the inception of databases up until April 9, 2021. The intervention group was ivermectin and the control group was standard of care or placebo. The primary outcome was mortality reported as risk ratio (RR).

Results

There were 9 RCTs comprising of 1788 patients included in this meta-analysis. Ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality (RR 0.39 [95% 0.20–0.74], p = 0.004; I 2: 58.2%, p = 0.051). Subgroup analysis in patients with severe COVID-19 showed borderline statistical significance towards mortality reduction (RR 0.42 [95% 0.18–1.00], p = 0.052; I 2: 68.3, p = 0.013). The benefit of ivermectin and mortality was reduced by hypertension (RR 1.08 [95% CI 1.03–1.13], p = 0.001); but was not influenced by age (p = 0.657), sex (p = 0.466), diabetes (p = 0.429). Sensitivity analysis using fixed-effect model showed that ivermectin decreased mortality in general (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.29–0.62], p < 0.001) and severe COVID-19 subgroup (RR 0.48 [95% CI 0.32–0.72], p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 with a low certainty of evidence. Further adequately powered double-blinded placebo-controlled RCTs are required for definite conclusion.

### Drugs against SARS-CoV-2: what do we know about their mode of action? [^c86ffdaa]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The health emergency caused by the recent Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to identify effective treatments against the virus causing this disease (SARS-CoV-2). The first clinical trials have been testing repurposed drugs that show promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in cultured cells. Although more than 2400 clinical trials are already under way, the actual number of tested compounds is still limited to approximately 20, alone or in combination. In addition, knowledge on their mode of action (MoA) is currently insufficient. Their first results reveal some inconsistencies and contradictory results and suggest that cohort size and quality of the control arm are two key issues for obtaining rigorous and conclusive results. Moreover, the observed discrepancies might also result from differences in the clinical inclusion criteria, including the possibility of early treatment that may be essential for therapy efficacy in patients with Covid-19. Importantly, efforts should also be made to test new compounds with a documented MoA against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials. Successful treatment will probably be based on multitherapies with antiviral compounds that target different steps of the virus life cycle. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach that combines artificial intelligence, compound docking, and robust invitro and invivo assays will accelerate the development of new antiviral molecules. Finally, large retrospective studies on hospitalized patients are needed to evaluate the different treatments with robust statistical tools and to identify the best treatment for each Covid-19 stage. This review describes different candidate antiviral strategies for Covid-19, by focusing on their mechanism of action.

### Prioritization of anti-SARS-cov-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on plasma and target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics [^5793f9b5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the target plasma and lung concentrations of these drugs following approved dosing in humans. Accordingly, concentration 90% (EC 90) values recalculated from in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentration (C max) at an approved dose in humans (C max /EC 90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analyzed drugs achieved a C max /EC 90 ratio above 1. A more in-depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval. An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (K p U lung) was also simulated to derive a lung C max /half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50) as a better indicator of potential human efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir-boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin, and lopinavir (ritonavir-boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC 50. Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC 50 by 7.8-fold and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritizing compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC 90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments, such as the lungs, in order to maximize the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.

### Quality of clinical evidence and political justifications of ivermectin mass distribution of COVID-19 kits in eight latin American countries [^cdb8df40]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

In 2020, at least eight countries in Latin America (Bolivia, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and Peru) started mass distributions of COVID-19 'kits' to the population either at federal or subnational government health services for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in order to prevent hospitalisations and alleviate the burden of the pandemic on hospitals. While some countries distributed the kits to households and in the communities, others gave them to those who had tested SARS-CoV2 positive or only with a medical prescription. Many of the kits contained medicines that were not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 at the time by medicine regulatory authorities in these countries, including ivermectin, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies reported that some medicines, such as ivermectin, had antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

Ivermectin is widely used as an antiparasitic in humans and animals. Common adverse reactions of ivermectin reported in humans include headache, pruritus, muscle pain, cough, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and postural hypotension. Rare adverse reactions reported include the complex inflammatory responses called Mazzotti reactions. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin received particular attention because the results of an in vitro study in April 2020 suggested that it was an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2.

This study compares the timeline of the publication of scientific evidence on the efficacy of ivermectin as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 with the timelines of dissemination of ivermectin in COVID-19 kits in eight Latin American countries and describes the justification from governments for the inclusion of ivermectin in the kits.

### Randomized trial of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine for COVID-19 [^a5cd51c7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-OUT (ivermectin) was published by Carolyn T Bramante and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the population was: 808 patients (442 female, 366 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization for COVID-19 infection or other reasons; symptom onset > 7 days; immunocompromised patient; hepatic impairment; alcohol use disorder; history of severe kidney disease. In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the interventions were: n = 410 ivermectin (ivermectin alone at a dose of 390–470 mcg/kg/day for 3 days or ivermectin in combination with metformin) n = 398 placebo (matching placebo or metformin alone). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (25.8% vs. 24.6%; aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.45). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in composite outcome of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (5.7% vs. 4.1%; aOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.69) No significant difference in hospitalization or death (1% vs. 1.3%; aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.77) No significant difference in hypoxemia (23.6% vs. 22.6%; aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.46). In the COVID-OUT (ivermectin) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days, ivermectin was not superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death.

The study ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) was published by Susanna Naggie and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of ivermectin in outpatients with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 infection? In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the population was: 1591 patients (933 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 30 years with confirmed COVID-19, experiencing ≥ 2 symptoms of acute infection for ≤ 7 days. The key exclusion criteria were prior diagnosis of COVID-19 infection; current/recent hospitalization; known allergy/hypersensitivity/contraindication to the study drug. In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the interventions were: n = 817 ivermectin (at a dose of 400 mcg/kg daily for 3 days) n = 774 placebo (matching placebo daily for 3 days). In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median time to sustained recovery (12 days vs. 13 days; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of hospitalization or death by day 28 (1.22% vs. 1.16%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6) No significant difference in the rate of composite outcome of hospitalization, urgent or emergency care visit, or death by day 28 (3.9% vs. 3.6%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.8). In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 30 years with confirmed COVID-19, experiencing ≥ 2 symptoms of acute infection for ≤ 7 days, ivermectin was not superior to placebo with respect to median time to sustained recovery.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^f92c370c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Viral clearance at seven days

Four studies comparing ivermectin to placebo or standard of care reported viral clearance at seven days in 265 participants with moderate disease (Ahmed 2020; Kirti 2021; Mohan 2021; Pott‐Junior 2021). Two of the studies with 159 participants were included in the primary analysis due the overall risk of bias assessment (Analysis 1.13) (Ahmed 2020; Mohan 2021). We are uncertain whether ivermectin increases or reduces viral clearance at seven days compared to placebo (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.48; 2 studies, 159 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for serious risk of bias, one level for serious heterogeneity (I 2 = 77%), and two levels for very serious imprecision due to few participants and wide CIs. The other two studies with high risk of bias were included in a secondary analysis (Analysis 1.14) (Kirti 2021; Pott‐Junior 2021). The point estimate of the secondary analysis lay closer to 1 and the 95% CI was wide and included 1 (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.86; 4 studies, 265 participants). One study included in the primary analysis was published as a preprint article (Mohan 2021), the other study was published as a journal article (Ahmed 2020). The sensitivity analysis including only the study published in a journal favoured ivermectin compared to placebo (RR 3.83, 95% CI 1.23 to 11.93; 1 study, 45 participants).

### Misinformation, trust, and use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 [^ddba2236]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The antiparasitic agents ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were both touted as cures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in the absence of evidence of efficacy. Despite multiple US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) statements clarifying that these medicines are not indicated for COVID-19, prescribing increased substantially in the US, Canada, and Australia in the first year of the pandemic,; 1 studyshowed an association between prescribing and county-level support for Donald Trump. Beyond a lack of efficacy, such prescriptions were associated with risk of toxic effects. Their use thus introduced inefficiencies and expense as well as potential adverse effects on health and may help explain the observed association between more misinformation-prone counties and greater COVID-19 death rates.

In light of the potential consequences of non–evidence-based treatment, to inform future pandemic responses, we sought to better understand the prevalence of such treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the features associated with its use. Prior studies, using prescription databases may not capture overall prevalence of non–evidence-based treatment use if these medications were acquired in other ways and have not described the full range of sociodemographic features associated with their use.

Beyond such features, we sought to understand other characteristics of individuals that might be associated with risk of non–evidence-based treatment use. In particular, the rapid dissemination of demonstrably false information about COVID-19 has been a notable feature of the pandemic. From the source of the pandemic, to its means of spread, to its potential impact, false or misleading statements have been widespread on social mediaas well as some traditional news sources. Among the most prominent types of misinformation have been statements concerning the off-label treatment of COVID-19.

We therefore also investigated the association between endorsing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine and pursuing these treatments, hypothesizing that susceptibility to misinformation would also be reflected in treatment choice. More broadly, we explored trust in institutions, reasoning that those with lesser trust in health care institutions might be more likely to pursue non–evidence-based treatments. We examined the extent to which conspiratorial thinking in general is associated with choosing these treatments. Finally, we investigated whether source of news about COVID-19 was associated with use of non–evidence-based medication. In all of these analyses, we modeled the effects of political affiliation to understand whether any observed associations could be explained by such affiliation alone.

### Post-exposure lopinavir-ritonavir prophylaxis versus surveillance for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2: the COPEP pragmatic open-label, cluster randomized trial [^85b90cc5]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to exert intense pressure on societies and health systems worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than other coronaviruses, with a high infectivity during the incubation period. Although mass vaccination will reduce secondary attack rates, estimated to be 16.6% for household transmission in a meta-analysis, and the occurrence of severe COVID-19 cases, vaccine hesitancy, delays in vaccine roll-out, waning immunity post-vaccination, non-response to vaccine, and emerging virus variants of concern are reasons for SARS-CoV-2 to maintain its outbreak potential in the years to come. In addition to vaccination, contact tracing, mass testing, isolation and quarantine, an affordable, easy-to-use and safe post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) would be an effective tool to contain future outbreaks in vulnerable populations.

A range of PEP candidates against COVID-19 are currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Recent data on the use of combinations of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab/indevimab etesevimab and bamlanivimab are encouraging. However, there are major constraints to their wide use, including costs, manufacturing capacities, and the need for in-hospital administration. Several drugs have been repurposed as potential prophylactic agents against COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), favipiravir, and ivermectin. Recent systematic reviews and network meta-analysis found little or no effect of hydroxychloroquine on reducing mortality, hospital admission or the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. LPV/r, a protease inhibitor used in antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, was repurposed as a PEP agent after studies demonstrated in vitro action against SARS-CoV-2following reports of promising clinical data for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection. In four published randomised clinical trials on treatment for hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, LPV/r did not show any effect on clinical endpoints, but no randomised clinical trial assessing LPV/r as PEP against COVID-19 has been published to date.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

When we conducted the previous review version, there were numerous reviews circulating that investigated the efficacy of ivermectin for treatment of COVID‐19 and prophylaxis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with inconsistent results in meta‐analyses and conclusions, in many cases conflicting with our findings. Conflicts were mainly due to inclusion of trials investigating active comparators with unproven efficacy (e.g. hydroxychloroquine), pooling of trials with active and inactive comparators, different definitions of outcomes or outcomes assessment times, and different interpretations of the certainty of evidence. In the meantime, some of the reviews that had received major attention and that we discussed in the previous review version, have been retracted or concerns regarding their methodology have been expressed.

In our previous review version, we highlighted the withdrawal of the large Elgazzar 2020 trial, which apparently showed signs of fraudulence and was therefore withdrawn over ethical concerns by Research Square on 14 July 2021 (Elgazzar 2020; The Guardian 2021a). The authors have yet to clarify those issues.

In August 2021, the authors of an often‐cited meta‐analysis on ivermectin (Hill 2021a), retracted their article due to it being based on the withdrawn trial (Elgazzar 2020). The authors have not yet published an updated meta‐analysis (Hill 2021b).

In the discussion concerning ivermectin, two groups are especially worth mentioning, the Front Line COVID‐19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) and the British Ivermectin Recommendation Development (BIRD) group. Several of the founders and supporters are members of both groups. As described in our previous review version, both groups and individual group associates had conducted various systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, all with conclusions strongly in favour of the effectiveness of ivermectin for treatment and prevention of COVID‐19 (BIRD 2021; Bryant 2021a; Kory 2021). Additionally, there is an online and regularly‐updated analysis of published and emerging trials available (ivmmeta.com), postulating a strong beneficial effect of ivermectin for people with COVID‐19. The website does not provide authorship details, though states the FLCCC and BIRD as its resources. Main findings of the reviews, disagreements to our findings, and facts that have become public since, are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs.

### Randomized trial of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine for COVID-19 [^d02015d8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study COVID-OUT (metformin) was published by Carolyn T Bramante and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of metformin in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the population was: 1323 patients (741 female, 582 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization for COVID-19 infection or other reasons; symptom onset > 7 days; immunocompromised patient; hepatic impairment; alcohol use disorder; history of severe kidney disease. In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the interventions were: n = 663 metformin (immediate-release metformin alone, with an increase in dose over 6 days to 1,500 mg/day for 14 days, or metformin in combination with either fluvoxamine or ivermectin) n = 660 placebo (receipt of placebo, fluvoxamine alone or ivermectin alone). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (23.6% vs. 27.4%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite outcome of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death (4.1% vs. 7.3%; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.94) No significant difference in hospitalization or death from any cause (1.2% vs. 2.7%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.11) No significant difference in hypoxemia (22.6% vs. 24.3%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22). In the COVID-OUT (metformin) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized adult patients aged 30–85 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 within the past 3 days, metformin was not superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of hypoxemia, emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death.

### Use of ivermectin is associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019: the ivermectin in COVID nineteen study [^84f62ebf]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ivermectin was shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy has not been described previously.

Research Question

Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients?

Study Design and Methods

Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 and May 11, 2020, treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided, but treatment decisions were at the treating physician's discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as need for Fio 2 ≥ 50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders.

Results

Two hundred eighty patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% vs 25.2%; OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.96; P = 0.03). Mortality also was lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%; OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.47; P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%; OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 0.88–11.00; P = 0.07) or length of stay. After multivariate adjustment for confounders and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09–0.80; P = 0.03). One hundred ninety-six patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort. Mortality was significantly lower in the ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%; OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22–0.99; P < .05), an 11.2% (95% CI, 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, with a number needed to treat of 8.9 (95% CI, 4.5–263).

Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^ce54e2ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Viral clearance at 14 days

Two studies comparing ivermectin to placebo or standard of care reported viral clearance at 14 days in 69 participants with moderate‐to‐severe disease (Ahmed 2020; Okumuş 2021). One of the studies with 45 participants was included in the primary analysis due the overall risk of bias assessment (Analysis 1.15) (Ahmed 2020). Ivermectin may increase viral clearance at 14 days compared to placebo (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.45; 1 study, 45 participants). The other study with high risk of bias was included in a secondary analysis (Analysis 1.16) (Okumuş 2021). The effect estimate of the secondary analysis was comparable to the primary analysis (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.33; 2 studies, 69 participants). The study included in the primary analysis was published as a journal article (Ahmed 2020).

Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for people with mild COVID‐19 treated in an outpatient setting

All‐cause mortality up to 28 days

Two studies comparing ivermectin to placebo reported data on mortality at 21 days (López‐Medina 2021) and at 28 days (Chaccour 2021) for 422 participants with mild disease. Both studies were included in the primary meta‐analysis due to the overall risk of bias assessment (Analysis 2.1). In the meta‐analysis, none of the participants died in the ivermectin group and one participant died in the placebo group. We are uncertain whether ivermectin reduces or increases all‐cause mortality up to 28 days compared to placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for serious risk of bias and two levels for very serious imprecision due to few participants, few events, and wide CIs. Both studies were published as journal articles.

### Antiviral mechanisms of candidate chemical medicines and traditional Chinese medicines for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^e46238d3]. Virus Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. Up to now, numerous medicines have been applied or approved for the prevention and control of the virus infection. However, the efficiency of each medicine or combination is completely different or still unknown. In this review, we discuss the types, characteristics, antiviral mechanisms, and shortcomings of recommended candidate medicines for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as perspectives of the drugs for the disease treatment, which may provide a theoretical basis for drug screening and application.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^75281217]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The website ivmmeta.com provides several meta‐analyses of pooled effects including up to 60 studies. This website shows pooled estimates suggesting significant benefits with ivermectin, which has resulted in confusion for clinicians, patients, and decision‐makers (Garegnani 2021). The analyses are misleading and have several limitations. As described for the other reviews, several ineligible interventions and comparators were pooled. Additionally, different outcomes were pooled and reported as percentage improvement with ivermectin studied in RCTs ranging from 40% improvement when used as late treatment to 83% improvement when used as prophylaxis. However, there is no full prospective protocol available describing the relevant review methodology, and there is no assessment of the risk of bias or the certainty of evidence.

National and international guidelines regarding the use of ivermectin for the treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 have been developed over the past 12 months. Recommendations from the WHO, updated 31 March 2021 (WHO 2021b); European Medicines Agency, updated 22 March 2021 (EMA 2021); Infectious Diseases Society of America, updated 13 February 2021 (IDSA 2021); and the COVID Management Guidelines India Group, updated 15 May 2021 (COVID Guidelines India 2021), concur that ivermectin should only be used for treatment of COVID‐19 in the context of clinical trials. The EMA additionally advises against the use of ivermectin for prophylaxis outside RCTs. (EMA 2021). The US NIH guidance updated on 11February 2021 describes 'insufficient data' to permit a recommendation for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID‐19 (NIH 2021). One statement in February 2021 by Merck, a manufacturer of ivermectin, describes the conclusions of their review of the evidence as providing "no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or efficacy in patients with COVID‐19" (Merck 2021).

### Anthracyclines inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection [^a82f72f9]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, there have been 656 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6.7 million deaths. The impacts of COVID-19 on public health, social life and economy have been astronomical. In addition to timely diagnosis, quarantine, social distancing and masking, COVID vaccines have played a critical role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, reducing disease severity and fatality, and restoring normal life. For those who contract SARS-CoV-2, effective treatments become pivotal in preventing disease progression and saving lives.

At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, treatment options were limited to supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation, immunomodulatory therapies with dexamethasone and adjunctive therapies with anticoagulants. A series of clinical trials were quickly conducted to test repurposed drugs including hydrocloroquine and ivermectin, but no significant clinical benefits were observed. Inconsistent results were reported from various trials of convalescent plasma, likely owing to unselected patients, including the vaccination status. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab plus imdevimab, bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, sotrovimab, tixagevimab plus cilgavimab have shown clinical benefits for both in-patients and out-patients, and have been approved to treat COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Remdesivir was the first direct antiviral drug approved to treat COVID-19, followed by molnupiravir and paxlovid which are used to treat patients at the onset of symptoms to suppress viral replication. The constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, in particular the Omicron variants bearing more than 50 mutations with over 30 in the viral Spike glycoprotein, often defy the effectiveness of vaccines and antibody-based therapy and pose resistance to the few approved antiviral drugs.

### American college of medical toxicology (ACMT) cautions against off-label prescribing of ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 [^08446772]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position on ivermectin for COVID-19 states that "clinicians should direct care" and that "a clinician should not be compelled to administer treatments that they believe to be harmful," noting "we do not know at this time if ivermectin makes the course of the disease better, worse, or has no effect." The statement emphasizes that "the drug can be legally- although inappropriately- prescribed off label for treatment or prevention of COVID-19" and that "ACMT has previously cautioned against harms of off-label prescribing when not supported by evidence," citing risks that "diversion of a medication for an unproven indication reduces availability for those who need the drug," concern for "the practice of hoarding," and that "off-label prescribing does not just impact drug supply, but also affects clinical research" because "when patients take ivermectin outside of the research setting, we do not gain understanding about whether the medication is helpful or harmful." For patients seeking ivermectin, ACMT advises that "Patients who desire ivermectin should receive the drug in the context of clinical research and should be encouraged to accept approved therapies such as COVID-19 vaccination," and clarifies that "this is the position of the American College of Medical Toxicology at the time written, after a review of the issue and pertinent literature."
