## Question

Under what circumstances should atropine be administered for asymptomatic bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking under what circumstances atropine should be administered for asymptomatic bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core guideline principle of symptom- and hemodynamic-driven treatment rather than heart rate thresholds. Then, I should verify when atropine is indicated in bradycardia algorithms and what dosing applies. Next, I will examine evidence and labeling for asymptomatic or physiologic bradycardia. After that, I need to check recognized exceptions where atropine is used preemptively or as an antidote. Finally, I should review contraindications, cautions, and a practical management approach including triggers for intervention and alternatives like pacing [^112SWohe] [^111RYy9G] [^116uzyy5].

> Let me first confirm the core principle: treatment of bradycardia is driven by symptoms and hemodynamic impact, not by an arbitrary heart rate alone. The ACC/AHA/HRS guideline explicitly cautions that therapy should rarely be prescribed solely based on a low heart rate or pause duration, which means asymptomatic, stable bradycardia generally does not warrant atropine or other urgent therapy by itself [^112SWohe] [^1172pub7].

> I need to verify where atropine fits in the acute algorithms. The AHA bradycardia algorithm recommends atropine when bradycardia is causing hemodynamic compromise (e.g., hypotension, altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure), reinforcing that the indication is symptomatic/unstable bradycardia rather than asymptomatic cases. ESC guidance is consistent in acute coronary settings: consider atropine for sinus bradycardia with hemodynamic intolerance, with temporary pacing if refractory. Standard adult dosing for symptomatic bradycardia is 0.5 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg, whereas bradyasystolic cardiac arrest dosing is 1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes up to 3 mg; wait, I should double-check to avoid mixing these regimens — yes, 0.5 mg for symptomatic bradycardia versus 1 mg for bradyasystolic arrest is correct [^111RYy9G] [^113rpTFU] [^113NJ8Qe] [^113AdaxM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should delineate asymptomatic and physiologic bradycardia. Asymptomatic bradycardia is common and can be normal in trained athletes, during sleep, or with elevated vagal tone, and in such settings treatment is observation and evaluation rather than atropine. Emergency care reviews emphasize that management hinges on the patient's hemodynamics and underlying rhythm, not the number on the monitor, aligning with the ACC/AHA/HRS stance [^1172pub7] [^116uzyy5] [^112SWohe].

> Let me consider drug-induced asymptomatic bradycardia, because I need to ensure I'm not over-treating. Multiple FDA labels distinguish asymptomatic from symptomatic bradycardia and do not require intervention for the former — e.g., siponimod and alectinib frequently produce asymptomatic bradycardia managed by monitoring and dose adjustments only if symptomatic or severe; similarly, crizotinib labeling advises monitoring and medication review, reserving intervention for symptomatic cases. This reinforces that bradycardia without symptoms or instability typically does not call for atropine [^116vAk6Z] [^112kLYE9] [^113r68NJ].

> But wait, what about procedural "preemptive" uses that might be misread as treating asymptomatic bradycardia? In certain high-risk scenarios, atropine is given prophylactically to blunt reflex vagal bradycardia before it causes instability — examples include pediatric laryngoscopy/intubation, oculocardiac reflex during strabismus surgery, and carotid artery stenting balloon inflation. I should confirm: ACEP-endorsed pediatric RSI pretreatment and ophthalmology anesthesia reviews support anticholinergic pretreatment, while vascular literature describes routine or selective prophylaxis for carotid stenting. These are anticipatory strategies in vagal-prone procedures, not treatment of stable, asymptomatic background bradycardia in routine care [^112L7gag] [^112GgB1H] [^116zQjE7] [^11181Pob].

> Next, I should review toxicologic exceptions, because atropine is an antidote. Atropine is first-line for organophosphate and carbamate poisoning to counter muscarinic excess irrespective of baseline heart rate, and it is commonly used for symptomatic bradycardia in specific overdoses (e.g., calcium channel blocker toxicity) as part of broader protocols. Additionally, atropine is co-administered with neostigmine to prevent bradycardia during neuromuscular blockade reversal, and clonidine-associated bradycardia can respond to atropine. These indications relate to pathophysiology of cholinergic excess or drug-induced vagal predominance and are distinct from the question of chronic, asymptomatic sinus bradycardia [^113oQJa1] [^1127WjiN] [^116m1nrS] [^1132PBQY] [^115GhUtz] [^1111S6qz].

> I should confirm key cautions and scenarios where atropine may be ineffective or harmful. Post–heart transplant patients often lack autonomic innervation and do not respond to atropine; guidelines advise against its use for sinus bradycardia without evidence of reinnervation. In acute coronary syndromes, while atropine can be used for hemodynamically intolerant bradycardia, there are case reports of worsened ischemia; clinical judgment and readiness to pace are essential. There are also reports suggesting potential aggravation of Takotsubo physiology after atropine. Furthermore, atropine may be ineffective in hyperkalemia-related bradycardia and in propofol-anesthetized patients due to blunted autonomic response — underlying cause correction or pacing may be required. I need to ensure these nuances are weighed before pressing the atropine button [^114uUWKi] [^113rpTFU] [^111qiXiA] [^111vVq8o] [^112hmc6e] [^1168J57G].

> Now, I will outline a practical approach to a patient with truly asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable bradycardia. Wait, let me verify the steps: continuous monitoring, focused history, rhythm analysis, and reversible cause evaluation come first. That includes reviewing medications (beta-blockers, non-DHP calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, oncologics), checking electrolytes and thyroid function, screening for ischemia or sleep apnea when indicated, and observing if physiologic. Atropine is not part of routine care here; rather, readdress contributing drugs and underlying conditions and consider ambulatory monitoring if diagnostic uncertainty persists [^1172pub7] [^116uzyy5] [^111ATDF3].

> I should double-check the clinical triggers that convert observation into intervention. Hemodynamic compromise — hypotension, syncope or presyncope, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, altered mental status, or signs of shock — warrants active treatment and escalation per ACLS, starting with atropine if a vagal/sinus mechanism is likely and moving to transcutaneous pacing, catecholamines, and transvenous pacing if refractory. The rhythm matters: high-degree AV block or unstable escape rhythms merit early pacing rather than reliance on atropine alone [^111RYy9G] [^116uzyy5].

> Let me think about the exact implementation if atropine is actually indicated. For symptomatic bradycardia, give 0.5 mg IV and repeat every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg while preparing alternatives if ineffective; for bradyasystolic cardiac arrest, use 1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes up to 3 mg — hold on, I should verify I'm not mixing these again — yes, those dosing distinctions are correct. If atropine fails or is contraindicated, proceed to pacing and/or chronotropic infusions per guideline. Always keep searching for reversible etiologies in parallel and correct them promptly [^113NJ8Qe] [^113AdaxM] [^111RYy9G].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: atropine should not be administered for asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable bradycardia; management is observation and evaluation of reversible causes, with treatment decisions anchored to symptoms and perfusion, not to heart rate alone. Reserve atropine for symptomatic or hemodynamically significant bradycardia, for procedural prophylaxis in select high-risk settings, or as an antidote in cholinergic poisoning and specific toxicologic scenarios, while applying cautions in post–heart transplant patients, suspected ischemia, and etiologies where atropine is ineffective or potentially harmful [^112SWohe] [^111RYy9G] [^113oQJa1] [^113rpTFU].

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^1172pub7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can appear as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals and in patients as part of normal aging or disease. Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia.

Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above a certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states. In this review, we highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in the evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

### Pediatric rapid sequence intubation: Incidence of reflex bradycardia and effects of pretreatment with atropine [^112L7gag]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommends atropine as adjunctive therapy to prevent reflex bradycardia prior to laryngoscopy/tracheal intubation (L/TI) in pediatric patients.

- **Objective**: To describe the incidence of reflex bradycardia and its relationship to the administration of atropine during L/TI in a Pediatric Emergency Department.

- **Design/Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was designed through reviewing records of all patients who received L/TI in the ED at an urban children's hospital from January 1997 to March 2001. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were placed into cohorts defined by whether they had received atropine prior to L/TI or not.

- **Results**: One hundred sixty-three patients received L/TI during the study period. One hundred forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients received atropine (atropine group) prior to L/TI. Seventy-two percent of atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for atropine pretreatment. Seventy-five patients did not receive atropine pretreatment (no-atropine group). Forty-three percent of no-atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for pretreatment with atropine. The atropine group was younger [mean 22.5 vs. 36.4 months, P = 0.003, 95% CI (-28.5, 0.70)], averaged the same number of intubation attempts [1.6 vs. 1.5, P = 0.941, 95% CI 0.1 (-0.3, 0.4)], and had normal or elevated HR for age prior to L/TI (mean 159 bpm). Hypoxia occurred more often in the atropine group [28% vs. 16%, P = 0.046, 95% CI for difference (0.3, 27.1)]. Bradycardia was noted in 6 patients during L/TI; 3 in the atropine group and 3 in the no-atropine group.

### The oculocardiac reflex: A review [^112GgB1H]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The OCR can still surprise clinicians, as one in ten patients may experience bradycardia to 50% of the baseline heart rate or lower. Interventions by the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and the characteristics of the patient do not lead to precise prediction of which patient might have a profound OCR or not.

Safe anesthesia for strabismus surgery should consider the use of adequate doses of anticholinergic medication or even orbital block, with an understanding of the potential adverse side effects of each. It is crucial to ensure an adequate intravenous line and airway, combined with sufficiently deep general anesthesia to avoid patient movement during ocular manipulation. If an IV is not available, atropine can be injected intramuscularly; however, the intraglossal route provides similar protection to the intravenous route, given a 5–7 minute waiting period before applying extraocular muscle (EOM) tension after baseline heart rate demonstrates anticholinergic-induced tachycardia.

Before manipulating ocular tissue or applying tension on EOMs, it is important to attain a stable heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Gentle, gradual tension on the EOM tendons, as well as the release of tension if bradycardia is elicited, is one of the best therapies for OCR (Figure 15). Abrupt, prolonged tension on one or more EOMs, especially in the left eye and targeting the inferior or superior rectus muscle, produces the most bradycardia. Recent doses of opioids and dexmedetomidine can profoundly augment OCR. Additionally, IV dexamethasone may also enhance OCR and warrants further study.

Unlike the diving response, OCR does not involve concomitant peripheral vasoconstriction, making further research into this area essential for improving patient outcomes during strabismus surgery.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning the management of bradyarrhythmias, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering intravenous positive chronotropic agents (epinephrine, vasopressin, and/or atropine) in patients with sinus bradycardia and hemodynamic intolerance or high-degree AV block without a stable escape rhythm. Temporary pacing should be performed in case of failure to respond to atropine.

### Atropine sulfate [^113SazTk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Atropine sulfate injection, USP, is indicated for the temporary blockade of severe or life-threatening muscarinic effects. It is used as an antisialagogue, an antivagal agent, an antidote for organophosphorus or muscarinic mushroom poisoning, and to treat bradyasystolic cardiac arrest. These highlights do not include all the information needed to use atropine sulfate injection safely and effectively; see full prescribing information for atropine sulfate injection.

- **Initial approval**: Atropine sulfate injection, for intravenous use, received initial U.S. approval in 1960.

### Electrocardiogram essentials: Bradycardia [^116uzyy5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic cases to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest. This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

- **Discussion**: Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, as it will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

### Duraclon [^1111S6qz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Epidural clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate. Symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine. Rarely, atrioventricular block greater than first degree has been reported. Clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia.

- **Cardiac effects**: Epidural clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate. Symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine. Rarely, atrioventricular block greater than first degree has been reported. Clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia.

- **Respiratory depression and sedation**: Clonidine administration may result in sedation through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem. High doses of clonidine cause sedation and ventilatory abnormalities that are usually mild. Tolerance to these effects can develop with chronic administration. These effects have been reported with bolus doses that are significantly larger than the infusion rate recommended for treating cancer pain.

- **Depression**: Depression has been seen in a small percentage of patients treated with oral or transdermal clonidine. Depression commonly occurs in cancer patients and may be exacerbated by treatment with clonidine. Patients, especially those with a known history of affective disorders, should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of depression.

- **Pain of visceral or somatic origin**: In the clinical investigations, at doses tested, Duraclon was most effective in well-localized, "neuropathic" pain that was characterized as electrical, burning, or shooting in nature, and which was localized to a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution. Duraclon may be less effective, or possibly ineffective, in the treatment of pain that is diffuse, poorly localized, or visceral in origin.

### Neostigmine [^115GhUtz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia.

- **Serious reactions with coexisting conditions**: Use with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome, or myasthenia gravis.

- **Neuromuscular dysfunction**: Can occur if large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection are administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal. Reduce the dose if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

- **Bradycardia**: Neostigmine has been associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Serious adverse reactions in patients with certain coexisting conditions**: Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome, or myasthenia gravis. Due to the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with certain cardiovascular conditions, such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. The risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis.

### Incidence of bradycardia and the use of atropine in pediatric rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department [^1158wyME]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Bradycardia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is an uncommon but serious adverse effect encountered in pediatric intubations. Historically, atropine has been used in the pediatric population as RSI premedication to prevent bradycardia, especially when using succinylcholine as an induction agent. The objective of this analysis was to identify the incidence of bradycardia with or without atropine use.

This single-center, retrospective, observational case series reviewed pediatric patients up to 18 years old requiring intubation from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Bradycardia was determined by analyzing heart rates associated with time during and up to 5 minutes after intubation.

A total of 62 patients were included, with three (4.8%) experiencing a bradycardic event during intubation. Of these patients, 15 (24.2%) received atropine for pretreatment of RSI. The incidence of bradycardia was similar between those who received atropine and those who did not. An increasing trend in atropine use was noted throughout the assessment period, yet only 18 (29%) patients met criteria for atropine pretreatment based on the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations for RSI.

In conclusion, bradycardia incidence was low in pediatric patients undergoing RSI in our emergency department. The use of atropine or succinylcholine did not affect the incidence of bradycardia during pediatric intubation over this study period. Our results show a low incidence of bradycardia and support the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations.

### Carotid angioplasty and stent-induced bradycardia and hypotension: Impact of prophylactic atropine administration and prior carotid endarterectomy [^116zQjE7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: We compared the physiological effect of selective atropine administration for bradycardia with routine prophylactic administration before balloon inflation during carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). We also compared the incidence of procedural bradycardia and hypotension for CAS in patients with primary stenosis versus those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

- **Methods**: A total of 86 patients were treated with CAS at three institutions. Complete periprocedural information was available for 75 of these patients. The median degree of stenosis was 90% (range, 60%-99%). Indications for CAS included severe comorbidities (n = 49), prior CEA (n = 21), and prior neck radiation (n = 5). Twenty patients with primary lesions were treated selectively with atropine only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (nonprophylactic group). Thirty-four patients with primary lesions received routine prophylactic atropine administration before balloon inflation or stent deployment (prophylactic group). The 21 patients with prior CEA received selective atropine treatment only if symptomatic bradycardia occurred (prior CEA group) and were analyzed separately. Mean age and cardiac comorbidities did not vary significantly between the prophylactic and nonprophylactic atropine groups or between the primary and prior CEA patient groups. Outcome measures included bradycardia (decrease in heart rate > 50% or absolute heart rate < 40 bpm), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or mean blood pressure < 50 mm Hg), requirement for vasopressors, and cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, arrhythmias).

### Synergistic bradycardia from beta blockers, hyperkalemia, and renal failure [^111mxJ4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a common vital sign encountered in the emergency department. These patients are often hemodynamically stable and require no emergent intervention. On occasion, bradycardia can cause hemodynamic instability, and there are established treatment pathways involving atropine, ionotropic and vasopressive infusions, and eventual mechanical pacing if necessary. However, these pathways fail to account for the many and varied causes of bradycardia and their treatment.

- **Case report**: A 24-year-old man presented to our emergency department with syncope caused by symptomatic bradycardia. This was caused by a largely unrecognized synergistic bradycardia resulting from renal failure, AV nodal blocker use, and hyperkalemia. Our patient's worsening renal failure caused accumulation of both potassium and beta blocker, which resulted in bradycardia and hypotension, in turn worsening renal failure secondary to poor renal perfusion and potentiating his hyperkalemia and beta blocker toxicity.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: There is a growing number of cases that suggest this is an underrecognized synergistic and potentially lethal mechanism of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia, and the treatment falls outside of typical algorithms for handling bradycardia. Understanding the multiple causes of these patients' hemodynamically unstable bradycardia allows for maximal medical management and can prevent unnecessary invasive management for these patients.

### Atropine sulfate for treatment of bradycardia in a patient with morbid obesity: What may happen when you least expect it [^112yyhmk]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old morbidly obese man was scheduled for surgical repair of an incisional ventral hernia. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with desflurane. A second dose of fentanyl 0.2 mg, given before starting surgery, resulted in sinus bradycardia and a mild decrease in arterial blood pressure. Atropine sulfate 0.5 mg was administered. One minute later, the ECG rhythm on the monitor changed to third-degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular response rate of 40 beats/min, associated with marked hypotension. Isoproterenol 0.02 mg reverted the atrioventricular block to sinus rhythm. Cardiac enzymes and ECG ruled out acute myocardial ischaemia.

The surgical procedure and the recovery from anaesthesia were uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day. For the treatment of bradycardia, atropine sulfate should be adjusted at least to lean body weight in order to avoid a paradoxical heart rate response in patients with obesity.

### Anticholinergic premedication to prevent bradycardia in combined spinal anesthesia and dexmedetomidine sedation: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113aZW7z]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

When dexmedetomidine is used in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, there is a high incidence of bradycardia in response to parasympathetic activation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of atropine premedication for preventing the incidence of bradycardia and the hemodynamic effect on patients undergoing spinal anesthesia with sedation by dexmedetomidine.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

- **Setting**: Operating room.

- **Patients**: One hundred fourteen patients (age range, 2–65 years; American Society of Anesthesiology class I-II) participated in this study, willing to be sedated and to undergo spinal anesthesia.

- **Intervention**: The patients were divided into two groups: group A and group C. After performing spinal anesthesia, dexmedetomidine was infused at a loading dose of 0.6 μg/kg for 10 minutes, followed by an infusion at 0.25 μg/(kg h). Simultaneously with the loading dose of dexmedetomidine, patients in group A received an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg atropine, whereas patients in group C received an intravenous normal saline bolus.

- **Measurement**: Data on the administration of atropine and ephedrine were collected. Hemodynamic data including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were also recorded.

- **Main results**: The incidence of bradycardia requiring atropine treatment was significantly higher in group C than in group A (P = 0.035). However, the incidence of hypotension needing ephedrine treatment showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.7).

### Atropine aggravates signs and symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^111vVq8o]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

We present a novel case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with worsening chest pain and T-wave inversions on electrocardiogram after atropine use. Our patient was an 82-year-old woman who complained of substernal chest discomfort lasting five hours. Atropine 0.5 mg was administered intravenously by the emergency medical service for symptomatic bradycardia. The patient subsequently experienced worsening chest pain and developed new T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram. Cardiac catheterization confirmed a diagnosis, revealing normal coronary arteries but akinesis of the apical segment.

Although the pathogenesis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not completely understood, catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning due to enhanced sympathetic activity is the most widely accepted underlying mechanism. The withdrawal of parasympathetic drive in such cases should exacerbate sympathetic activity, leading to the genesis or worsening of disease activity. The role of atropine in relation to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been questioned before. However, it has always been in the setting of general anesthesia induction, where atropine was used for the reversal of symptomatic bradycardia; consequently, determining the exact role of atropine in the disease process was difficult. Our patient received only atropine, thereby illustrating its capacity to worsen signs and symptoms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Because patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may present with recurrent chest pain, we recommend caution against the use of atropine for symptomatic bradycardia in such cases.

### Salagen [^114WQWNG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Management of overdose with salagen is critical. Fatal overdosage with pilocarpine has been reported in the scientific literature at doses presumed to be greater than 100 mg in two hospitalized patients; 100 mg of pilocarpine is considered potentially fatal. Overdosage should be treated with atropine titration (0.5 mg to 1.0 mg given subcutaneously or intravenously) and supportive measures to maintain respiration and circulation. Epinephrine (0.3 mg to 1.0 mg, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) may also be of value in the presence of severe cardiovascular depression or bronchoconstriction. It is not known if pilocarpine is dialyzable.

### Mayzent [^116vAk6Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 1, bradycardia occurred in 4.4% of Mayzent-treated patients compared to 2.9% of patients receiving placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic. A few patients experienced symptoms, including dizziness or fatigue, and these symptoms resolved within 24 hours without intervention [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Heart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed.

- **Atrioventricular conduction delays**: Initiation of Mayzent treatment has been associated with transient atrioventricular conduction delays that follow a similar temporal pattern as the observed decrease in heart rate during dose titration. The AV conduction delays manifested in most cases as first-degree AV block (prolonged PR interval on ECG), occurring in 5.1% of Mayzent-treated patients and in 1.9% of patients receiving placebo in Study 1. Second-degree AV blocks, usually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), have been observed at the time of treatment initiation with Mayzent in less than 1.7% of patients in clinical trials. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, resolved within 24 hours, rarely required treatment with atropine, and did not require discontinuation of Mayzent treatment.

If treatment with Mayzent is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought in patients with:

### Administration of atropine in the setting of acute myocardial infarction: potentiation of the ischemic process [^111qiXiA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Atropine has been suggested to potentially worsen the ischemic situation in patients experiencing acute coronary ischemia. We report the case of a female patient with ischemic chest pain and third-degree atrioventricular block who developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) immediately after atropine administration. Despite this apparent complication, the use of atropine remains a reasonable option and should be strongly considered. In some cases, acute ischemia is undoubtedly intensified by hypoperfusion attributable to vagally mediated bradyarrhythmia; atropine is the antidote for such situations. An awareness of this potential adverse reaction, coupled with a prudent selection of candidates for atropine therapy, will clarify the risk/benefit ratio for each individual patient and, therefore, guide the clinician.

### Xalkori [^113r68NJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving Xalkori. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, bradycardia occurred in 13% of 1719 patients treated with Xalkori. Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2.4% of Xalkori-treated patients and in 0.6% of the chemotherapy-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients aged 1 to ≤ 21 years treated with Xalkori, bradycardia was reported in 14%, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 0.8% of patients. Of the 26 patients with ALCL treated with Xalkori, bradycardia (all Grade 1) was reported in 19%. Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with Xalkori, bradycardia was reported in 14% of patients, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 7% of patients.

Avoid using Xalkori in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If bradycardia occurs, re-evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue Xalkori for bradycardia as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Opioid-free versus opioid-based anesthesia in pancreatic surgery [^111LVEpx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Safety outcome**: Bradycardia requiring atropine administration was more frequent in the opioid-based anesthesia (OBA) group than in the opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) group (11.9% vs. 5.7%). However, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.14), and the maximal dose administered was 0.75 mg. The need for hemodynamic support to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg was similar in all groups (OBA: 90.5%; OFA: 85.8%; P = 0.73, Chi-square test), with a median dose of 0.043 g/kg/min [0–0.2] also similar among groups (P = 0.73).

Median time to extubation was not different between groups.

Finally, based on the mean between-groups comparison effect size observed in the present study, the post hoc power analysis revealed that a total sample of 24 people using a t-test and 48 people using a chi-square test would be needed to obtain statistical power at a 0.9 level with alpha at 0.05.

### Lopressor [^11772N9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage signs and symptoms: Overdosage of Lopressor may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. The clinical presentation can also include atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, as well as nausea and vomiting.

- **Treatment**: Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures.

	- Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Bradycardia**: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs, or a pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders.

	- **Hypotension**: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

	- **Heart failure and shock**: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), and intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α1 receptor agonistic drugs added in the presence of vasodilation.

	- **Bronchospasm**: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116UApcQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Therapy in asymptomatic patients**: For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT): "Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison up to one hour previously. The potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded".

- **Rationale**: Based on case series, it is preferable to observe and monitor in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCBs, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose, to consider gastrointestinal decontamination and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for and types of decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

- **First-line therapy for symptomatic patients**: For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends the use of IV calcium. High-dose insulin therapy should be considered with other first-line treatments if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present. Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine is recommended in the presence of shock, even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed.

### Atropine sulfate [^115bA2Gf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents, or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally, a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.

Atropine sulfate injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the "blush" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine "fever" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children.

The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration, and both effects are non-linear.

### Comparison of current recommended regimens of atropinization in organophosphate poisoning [^116ePT1D]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Atropine is the mainstay of therapy in organophosphate (OP) toxicity, though research and consensus on dosing is lacking. In 2004, as reported by Eddleston et al, variation in recommended regimens was noted. We assessed revisions of original references, additional citations, and electronic sources to determine the variability in atropine dosing recommendations. Updated editions of references from Eddleston et al.'s work, texts of internal and emergency medicine, and electronic resources were reviewed for atropine dosing recommendations.

For comparison, recommendations were assessed using the same mean dose (23.4 mg) and the highest dose (75 mg) of atropine as used in the original paper. Recommendations were also compared with the dosing regimen from the World Health Organization (WHO). Thirteen of the original recommendations were updated, and 15 additional references were added, giving a convenience sample of 28. Sufficient information to calculate time to targeted dose was provided by 24 of these samples.

Compared to 2004, recommendations have greatly increased the speed of atropinization, with 13 out of 24 able to reach the mean and high atropine dose within 30 minutes compared to 1 out of 36 in 2004. In 2004, there were 13 regimens where the maximum time to reach 75 mg was over 18 hours, whereas now, there are 2. While only one recommendation called for doubling the dose for faster escalation in 2004, 15 of the 24 works include dose doubling.

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: A randomized controlled trial [^115LD7q9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

In the present study, although the blood pressure changes in both groups were within the clinically acceptable range, the blood pressure fluctuations in elderly patients in the atropine group were significantly higher than those in the glycopyrrolate group. Furthermore, ST segment depression in lead II was observed at multiple time points following A/N administration, and the ST segment still had not returned to baseline within 15 minutes. This ST depression may be a sign of coronary ischemia, which could be associated with the atropine-induced increase in heart rate. However, there was no significant depression in ST-II in the glycopyrrolate group, implying that low-dose G/N may not affect myocardial perfusion in elderly patients. This would be especially beneficial for the elderly with underlying myocardial ischemia or without a clinically confirmed diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

A large retrospective study found no significant correlation between G/N for neuromuscular blockade and the occurrence of cardiovascular complications 30 days postoperatively, but its exploratory analysis identified an elderly population susceptible to the cardiovascular side effects of G/N administration. In the study, two patients experienced a transient initial tachycardia (> 100 bpm) following A/N, for which we gave only close observation without treatment. In contrast, two patients in the glycopyrrolate group had severe bradycardia (< 45 bpm). There have been a few case reports of bradycardia and atrioventricular block following G/N, which may serve as a reminder to be alert to the occurrence of bradycardia with G/N.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^1132PBQY]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In situations with symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, the workgroup suggested using atropine at a dose regimen of 0.5 mg every 3–5 minutes for a few doses if needed. This suggestion is based on the considerations that atropine therapy may provide temporary help, is easily accessible, inexpensive, and is associated with minimal risks.

Although fluid resuscitation is commonly used, no formal recommendation was made due to the absence of fluid repletion studies specifically for CCB poisoning. Nonetheless, the workgroup considered fluid administration as first-line therapy, continuing as long as the patient shows evidence of fluid responsiveness (e.g. hemodynamic improvement based on hemodynamic parameters and monitoring devices such as echocardiography after receiving 10–20 mL/kg of crystalloid over 10–15 minutes).

- **Therapy for patients refractory to first-line treatments**: For the treatment of CCB-poisoned patients refractory to first-line treatments, the workgroup suggests:

	- Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (2D).
	- Pacemaker insertion in cases of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropy (2D).
	- IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D).

### The oculocardiac reflex: A review [^114f7yL8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

When profound oculocardiac reflex (OCR) strikes, what should the strabismus surgical team do? Is treatment more harmful than the bradycardia? In very young patients, cardiac output is primarily rate-dependent, so bradycardia leads to hypo-perfusion. In older patients, sudden bradydysrhythmias may persist or be associated with counterproductive compensatory adrenergic responses. The literature has reports of death associated with the oculocardiac reflex during strabismus or retinal surgery. A 17-year-old strabismus patient had IV atropine, halothane, and nitrous oxide, but tension on the lateral rectus produced prolonged OCR less than 50%, followed by cyanosis leading to ICU admission and death, with a subsequent finding of viral myocarditis. Asystole and pulmonary edema have been reported associated with the infestation of an extraocular muscle. Myocardial infarction has been reported associated with OCR treatment. Death during strabismus surgery appears to be rare. A recent 10-year summary of anesthesia-related claims through OMIC insurance in the United States had only one claim from strabismus surgery and only five with general anesthesia out of 50 total claims.

Over 110 years ago, one researcher named Aschner in Germany and another named Dagnini in Italy independently described a vagal reflex elicited from the manipulation of the eyes. Six years later, Petzetakis in France described cardiac and respiratory changes elicited from the eyes. An oculocardiac reflex during enucleation was reported in the American literature in 1935. In 1957, in the first of two papers, Kirsch et al. reported a 30% incidence of OCR defined as any electrocardiograph (ECG) change in 50 patients.

### Use of atropine in patients with chronotropic incompetence and poor exercise capacity during treadmill stress testing [^1124U4mL]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Treadmill stress testing (TMST) is a valuable diagnostic test for ischemic heart disease. However, the inability to achieve the target heart rate because of either chronotropic incompetence or poor exercise capacity is a significant limitation to its utility. We evaluated the usefulness of atropine in decreasing the number of tests with inconclusive results in patients with a poor chronotropic response or exercise capacity during TMST.

- **Methods**: The study comprised 126 patients undergoing TMST. In subjects experiencing fatigue at submaximal exercise, atropine was administered in doses of 0.5 mg per minute until the test conclusion (positive test results or target heart rate achieved) or until a maximum dose of 2 mg was administered.

- **Results**: Thirty-three of the 126 patients (26%) required atropine (mean dose, 1 mg) during the study; 23 of the 33 patients (70%) proceeded to achieve their target heart rate (n = 17) or positive test results (n = 6). The mean increase in heart rate after atropine administration was 25 beats/min (range 3–53 beats/min). Atropine was required in 39% of patients receiving beta-blockers, versus 21% of patients not receiving beta-blockers (P = 0.02). Among patients receiving atropine, a conclusive test was achieved significantly more often in patients not receiving beta-blockers (94% vs 46%, P = 0.01). No adverse events were associated with the use of atropine. Atropine administration resulted in conclusive tests more often in subjects with poor chronotropic response than in subjects with poor exercise capacity (78% vs 33%, P = < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Atropine improves conclusive test outcomes in patients with poor chronotropic response during TMST, especially in those not subjected to beta-blockers, without any adverse effects.

### Deliberate fingolimod overdose presenting with delayed hypotension and bradycardia responsive to atropine [^116r5i2g]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Fingolimod is an immunomodulating agent used in multiple sclerosis (MS). It is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist prescribed for relapsing forms of MS to delay the onset of physical disability. Since fingolimod is known to cause first-dose bradycardia, telemetry is recommended for the first 6 hours post-dose. We present the first reported case of deliberate fingolimod overdose requiring atropine administration for bradycardia and hemodynamic instability.

A 33-year-old woman ingested 14 mg of fingolimod and 2 g of phenoxymethylpenicillin. After presenting to the emergency department 19 hours later, she was initially hemodynamically stable (heart rate [HR] 60, blood pressure [BP] 113/89 mmHg). Two hours later, she developed bradycardia (HR 48) and hypotension (87/57 mmHg). Despite intravenous fluids, stabilization was only achieved after administration of atropine (300 μg). She was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further monitoring, where another episode of bradycardia and hypotension required atropine. She was monitored in the ICU for 48 hours and then discharged on day 5 with no further episodes.

Fingolimod is known to cause bradycardia in the first 6 hours post the first therapeutic dose. Following an intentional overdose, the onset of bradycardia occurred 21 hours post-ingestion and was associated with hypotension. Atropine was successful in treating bradycardia and associated hypotension.

### Corlanor [^113kzc2f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: Overdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia. In the event of bradycardia with poor hemodynamic tolerance, temporary cardiac pacing may be required. Supportive treatment, including intravenous (IV) fluids, atropine, and intravenous beta-stimulating agents such as isoproterenol, may be considered.

### 2020 APHRS/HRS expert consensus statement on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and patients with sudden cardiac arrest, and of their families [^1132hnVy]. Heart rhythm (2021). Low credibility.

Adenosine challenge has been used to unmask pre-excitation that may otherwise be missed. In the absence of other causes, it will indicate the need for an electrophysiological study to evaluate the risk of the accessory pathway (rapidity of antegrade conduction), followed by ablation therapy. However, electrophysiological study is not routinely included in the workup of unexplained cardiac arrest. Indeed, previous consensus guidelines proposed a Class 3 indication when assessing a suspected primary electrical disorder. It does not add additional diagnostic or prognostic value unless there is evidence to indicate otherwise.

For example, pre-excited atrial fibrillation, bundle branch re-entrant ventricular tachycardia, and rapid supraventricular tachycardias that degenerate into ventricular fibrillation have all previously been described as culprits requiring an invasive approach to diagnosis and curative ablation therapy. Electroanatomic voltage mapping of the right ventricle is a discretionary tool that may be considered to detect evidence of subclinical arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. More recently, extensive endocardial and epicardial mapping of unexplained cardiac arrest cases has been employed to identify cases with either Purkinje triggers and/or subtle depolarization abnormalities that may be suitable for ablation therapy.

Recommendations for investigation of SCA survivors: provocative testing indicates that concealed Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, CPVT, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, pre-excitation, and coronary vasospasm may be uncovered by provocative measures.

### Heart rate response to intravenous atropine during propofol anesthesia [^1168J57G]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

We studied the dose-response relationships for atropine-induced heart rate (HR) changes in 61 patients during propofol anesthesia. The control group (n = 15) received no propofol.

- **Group P-5**: (n = 22) received IV propofol 1.25 mg/kg over 1 minute followed by propofol at 5 mg/kg/h. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with propofol 5 mg/kg/h and 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen.

- **Group P-10**: (n = 24) received IV propofol 2.5 mg/kg over 1 minute followed by propofol at 10 mg/kg/h. The P-10 protocol was otherwise identical.

All patients received incremental doses of IV atropine 5 microg/kg over 5 seconds at 2-minute intervals until HR increased > 20 bpm from baseline values. Heart rate response to atropine 10 microg/kg was attenuated in Groups P-5 (12 ± 7 bpm) and P-10 (9 ± 6 bpm) compared with the control group (28 ± 13 bpm). HR increased > 20 bpm in all patients of the control group but in only 43% and 13% of patients in Groups P-5 and P-10, respectively (P < 0.05).

These results indicate that the decreased HR responsiveness to IV atropine in patients receiving propofol, which cannot be effectively overcome by a large dose of atropine, is possibly attributable to propofol-induced suppression of the sympathetic nervous system.

Implications: Heart rate response to IV atropine is attenuated during propofol anesthesia, and the decreased responsiveness to atropine cannot be effectively overcome by a large dose of atropine.

### Modulation of QT interval during autonomic nervous system blockade in humans [^112gBW2X]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

It is thought that the autonomic nervous system modulates the QT interval, but traditional autonomic blockade combining propranolol and atropine has produced conflicting results. We used the alternative approach of interrupting neurotransmission at the level of autonomic ganglia to determine its effect on the QT interval.

- **Methods and results**: We infused trimethaphan at increasing doses (0.5 to 10 mg/min IV) while monitoring heart rate, heart rate variability spectra, QT interval, and blood pressure in 10 normal volunteers, 9 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 8 patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTc). Patients with PAF had very low heart rate variability and a prolonged QTc at baseline (465 ± 8 ms) compared with patients with MSA (448 ± 6 ms) and normal subjects (432 ± 6 ms). In normal subjects, trimethaphan dose-dependently prolonged QTc (to 469 ± 7 ms), decreased RR interval (from 995 ± 45 to 670 ± 35 ms), and abolished heart rate variability. In MSA patients, trimethaphan also prolonged QTc (to 463 ± 7 ms) and reduced heart rate variability but did not significantly change the RR interval (from 813 ± 38 to 801 ± 39 ms).

- **Conclusions**: Autonomic blockade prolongs the QT interval in normal subjects to a similar duration as in PAF patients. Furthermore, blocking residual autonomic tone in PAF patients is associated with a further increase in QT interval length. Patients with MSA have greater residual sympathetic tone and greater prolongation of the QT interval during ganglionic blockade than normal subjects.

### Sectral [^116Hq6g5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

No specific information on emergency treatment of overdosage is available for Sectral. However, overdosage with other β-blocking agents has been accompanied by extreme bradycardia, advanced atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction defects, hypotension, severe congestive heart failure, seizures, and in susceptible patients, bronchospasm and hypoglycemia. Although specific information on the emergency treatment of Sectral overdose is not available, based on the pharmacological actions and observations in treating overdoses with other β-blockers, the following general measures should be considered:

- **Empty stomach**: By emesis or lavage.
- **Bradycardia**: IV atropine (1 to 3 mg in divided doses). If the antivagal response is inadequate, administer isoproterenol cautiously, as larger than usual doses of isoproterenol may be required.
- **Persistent hypotension in spite of correction of bradycardia**: Administer vasopressor (e.g. epinephrine, levarterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) with frequent monitoring of blood pressure and pulse rate.
- **Bronchospasm**: A theophylline derivative, such as aminophylline and/or a parenteral β2-stimulant, such as terbutaline.
- **Cardiac failure**: Digitalize the patient and/or administer a diuretic. It has been reported that glucagon is useful in this situation.

### Cardizem [^116tya22]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases, intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required, and patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

### Percutaneous injection of lidocaine within the carotid body area in carotid artery stenting: an "old-new" technique [^11181Pob]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Severe bradycardia is a common untoward effect during balloon angioplasty when performing carotid artery stenting. Therefore, atropine injection even before dilatation and the presence of an anesthesiologist are advocated for all patients. In surgical literature, the injection of a local anesthetic agent into the carotid sinus before carotid endarterectomy has been performed in an attempt to ameliorate perioperative hemodynamic instability. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that percutaneous infiltration of the carotid sinus with a local anesthetic immediately before balloon dilatation reduces bradycardia and decreases the need for atropine injection or the presence of an anesthesiologist. Infiltration of the carotid sinus with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine, 3 minutes before dilatation, was performed in 30 consecutive patients. No one exhibited any significant rhythm change that required atropine injection. The anesthesiologist did not encounter any hemodynamic instability during the carotid artery stenting procedure.

### Addition of atropine to submaximal exercise stress testing in patients evaluated for suspected ischaemia with SPECT imaging: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116vzo9Z]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of the addition of atropine to exercise testing in patients who failed to achieve their target heart rate during stress myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

- **Methods**: The study was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease who failed to achieve a target heart rate (≥ 85% of maximal predicted HR) during exercise SPECT imaging were randomized to receive intravenous atropine (n = 100) or placebo (n = 101).

- **Results**: The two groups of patients did not differ with respect to demographic or clinical characteristics. A higher proportion of patients in the atropine group achieved the target heart rate compared to the placebo group (60% versus 3%, p < 0.0001). SPECT imaging was abnormal in a higher proportion of patients in the atropine group as compared to the placebo group (57% versus 42%, p < 0.05). Stress-induced myocardial ischaemia was present in more patients in the atropine group as compared to placebo (47% versus 29%, p < 0.01). In both groups of patients, no major side effects occurred.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of atropine at the end of exercise testing is more effective than placebo in raising heart rate to adequate levels, without additional risks of complications. The use of atropine in patients who initially failed to achieve their maximal predicted heart rate is associated with a higher probability of achieving a diagnostic myocardial perfusion study.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112WE9tS]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for cardiac syncope and arrhythmic syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting arrhythmic syncope with high probability in the presence of any of the following ECG findings (Class: I, Level: C):

- **Persistent sinus bradycardia**: Greater than 3 seconds in the awake state and in the absence of physical training.
- **Mobitz II second- and third-degree AV block**.
- **Alternating LBBB and RBBB**.
- **VT or rapid paroxysmal SVT**.
- **Non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT and long or short QT interval**.
- **Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator malfunction**: Accompanied by cardiac pauses.

### Signifor [^116vrVMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia and QT prolongation**: Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as a history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.

- **QT prolongation**: SIGNIFOR is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with SIGNIFOR, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. SIGNIFOR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those with congenital long QT syndrome, uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia), those on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances known to cause QT prolongation, or those with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.

A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR, and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to SIGNIFOR administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy.

### Bradyarrhythmias, temporary and permanent pacing [^115gLXxM]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is common in critical care units. It may be transient, asymptomatic, and of little consequence, or it may be life-threatening. Bradycardia may result from abnormalities of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, or the His-Purkinje system. It may also be precipitated by drug effects or enhanced vagal tone. Proper diagnosis is pivotal to determining prognosis and management. Temporary and permanent pacing are now readily available, markedly improving the morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias.

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^112DV1qV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Randomization and blinding**: Using a computer-generated randomization table, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the glycopyrrolate group (group G) or the atropine group (group A). Group assignments were secured in a sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelope, which was then handed to a nurse who was not involved in the study. Test drugs were prepared in identical 10 mL syringes by the same nurse. The anesthesiologists involved in anesthesia management and postoperative follow-up were blinded to the group assignments.

- **Anesthetic and surgical management**: Once in the operating room, all subjects underwent standard monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG), NBP, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and bispectral index (BIS). After inducing general anesthesia with alfentanil (0.03–0.08 mg/kg), etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg), tracheal intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. The appropriate depth of anesthesia (BIS value 40–60) was maintained by micropump infusion of propofol (2–4 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.05–0.15 ug/kg/min), and 0.5–2 vol% sevoflurane/oxygen/air mix inhalation. Intraoperative blood pressure was kept within 20% of baseline, and heart rate was maintained at 45–90 beats per min (bpm). One-third of the induction dose of cisatracurium was added intraoperatively as needed. There were no additional muscle relaxants administered for at least 30 minutes before the procedure ended. At the end of the surgical procedure, the administration of sevoflurane inhalation, propofol, and remifentanil pumping was discontinued.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, more specifically with respect to electrophysiology study, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an electrophysiology study in selected patients with symptoms suspected to be attributable to bradycardia for diagnosis and elucidation of the bradycardia mechanism if the initial noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in oncological patients-epidemiology, risk factors, and management within the context of the new ESC 2022 guidelines [^111ATDF3]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). High credibility.

Bradycardia episodes secondary to cancer treatment are usually asymptomatic depending on the heart rate at the time of the episode. Possible symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, pre-syncope, or syncope. If the patient is symptomatic, Holter-ECG is recommended to assess the severity of the bradycardia and exclude long sinus pauses. A trial of withdrawing anticancer drugs should be performed to confirm the coincidence with the symptoms. A multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the treatment at a lower dose and eventually consider alternative therapy. Pacemaker implantation is indicated when there is no substitution for the treatment. The final decision should take into account patients' preferences and should be made after consultation with both a cardiologist and an oncologist.

To summarize, the management of arrhythmias in oncological patients should be based on clinical practice guidelines, especially the newest ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology. Careful patient observation for possible symptoms of arrhythmia and ECG monitoring are the basis of management during oncological treatment with high arrhythmogenic potential.

### Alecensa [^112kLYE9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia**: Symptomatic bradycardia occurred in patients treated with Alecensa. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], bradycardia occurred in 11% of patients treated with Alecensa. Additionally, 20% of the 521 patients treated with Alecensa, for whom serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were available, experienced post-dose heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).

It is recommended to monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. For asymptomatic bradycardia, dose modification is not required. For symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, Alecensa should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, and an evaluation of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medications, should be conducted. If bradycardia is attributable to a concomitant medication, resume Alecensa at a reduced dose (see Table 2) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated.

Permanently discontinue Alecensa in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Permanently discontinue Alecensa for recurrence of life-threatening bradycardia.

### A randomized controlled trial of intravenous aminophylline for atropine-resistant out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest [^114nwmMk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Myocardial ischemia during cardiopulmonary arrest can lead to atropine-resistant bradyasystole due to the interstitial accumulation of endogenous adenosine. Aminophylline is a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist capable of reversing ischemia-induced bradyasystole in a variety of settings. This study hypothesized that aminophylline improves the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when used early in the resuscitation effort.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial set in an urban emergency medical services system serving a population of 250,000. All non-pregnant, normothermic adults suffering nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (February 1999 to August 2000) with asystole were eligible. Patients remaining in asystole after initial doses of epinephrine and atropine received either aminophylline 250 mg or a matching placebo as a bolus injection through a peripheral intravenous line. All other aspects of the attempted resuscitation proceeded in accordance with standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. A sample size of 102 patients was calculated to yield a power of 80% to show an absolute improvement of 25% in ROSC. The aminophylline and control groups were compared by calculating 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and the data were modeled using logistic regression.

- **Results**: The investigators enrolled 112 consecutive patients. One subject was dropped prior to analysis because of missing data. Data for 111 patients were analyzed.

### Atropine [^112X5AFU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the event of accidental ingestion or toxic overdosage with atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, supportive care may include a short-acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended.

Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required.

Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations.

The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal.

### Amisulpride and symptomatic bradycardia: a case report [^113oVRUL]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Amisulpride is a second-generation antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and other major psychotic illnesses. Amisulpride-induced bradycardia is a rare condition of unknown etiology and mechanism. Asymptomatic bradycardia has been associated with amisulpride in only two cases. In our case, the association was rated as "probable" on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale.

- **Method**: Case report.

- **Results**: A 45-year-old male patient developed symptomatic bradycardia during usage of amisulpride (400–800 mg/day), which dramatically improved after the complete termination of amisulpride usage. The psychiatric condition remained relatively stable without bradycardia after administration of another antipsychotic agent [risperidone (3 mg/day)].

- **Conclusion**: This is the first case report of symptomatic bradycardia associated with the use of amisulpride. Although bradycardia is a rare adverse reaction to antipsychotics, this finding may alert psychiatrists and physicians to this antipsychotic drug side effect. Further study is needed to disclose the role of antipsychotics in bringing about symptomatic bradycardia.

### Vosevi [^116zrsfD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported when Vosevi is coadministered with amiodarone. Postmarketing cases include symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention. Notably, a fatal cardiac arrest occurred in a patient taking amiodarone and a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)). Bradycardia typically manifests within hours to days, though instances have been recorded up to two weeks after initiating treatment for HCV. Patients who are also on beta blockers, have underlying cardiac conditions, or have advanced liver disease are at increased risk of symptomatic bradycardia with this coadministration. Bradycardia usually resolves after discontinuation of HCV treatment; however, the mechanism remains unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with Vosevi is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who lack other treatment alternatives and will be coadministered Vosevi:

- **Counsel patients**: Inform them about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia.
- **Cardiac monitoring**: In-patient monitoring is advised for the first 48 hours of coadministration, followed by outpatient or self-monitoring of heart rate daily for at least the initial two weeks of treatment.

Patients starting amiodarone therapy due to lack of alternatives should follow similar cardiac monitoring protocols as described above. Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, patients discontinuing amiodarone therapy with Vosevi should also adhere to these guidelines.

### The use of atropine in a nerve agent response with specific reference to children: are current guidelines too cautious [^112cFnxV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This review examines the potential use of nerve agents by a terrorist organization against a civilian population, which has become an increasingly apparent threat in the UK. Present guidelines for the use of atropine, particularly in children, following such an event are unclear. No precise agreement exists on the most appropriate dose of atropine or the frequency with which it should be administered. This uncertainty leaves children vulnerable as potentially life-saving treatment may be crucially delayed. Guidelines must be standardized to allow rapid antidotal delivery and maximize the potential for survivors. This review examines the issues currently surrounding the use of atropine in children following a nerve agent attack and proposes strategies for treating exposed children.

### Guideline removal of atropine and survival after adult in-hospital cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm [^112WgpGN]. Resuscitation (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine whether the removal of atropine from the 2010 ACLS guidelines for non-shockable cardiac arrests was associated with a change in survival.

Using the Get With The Guidelines® - Resuscitation registry, adults with an index in-hospital cardiac arrest between 2006 and 2015 were included. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation and favorable functional outcomes. An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted to compare survival before (pre-guidelines) and after (post-guidelines) the introduction of the 2010 guidelines. A difference-in-difference approach was employed to compare the interrupted time-series results between the non-shockable and shockable cohorts, accounting for guideline changes unrelated to atropine.

Results indicated the inclusion of 20,499 non-shockable and 3,968 shockable cardiac arrests. Patient characteristics were similar across the pre-guidelines and post-guidelines periods. Atropine usage was recorded in 8,653 (87%) non-shockable and 680 (35%) shockable cardiac arrests during the pre-guidelines period, and in 3,643 (35%) non-shockable and 320 (16%) shockable cardiac arrests during the post-guidelines period. There was no significant difference in the change over time in survival from the pre-guidelines to the post-guidelines period for the non-shockable compared to the shockable cohort (risk difference: 2.0% [95% CI: -0.8, 4.8] per year, p = 0.17). The immediate change in survival following the introduction of the guidelines was also not significantly different between the cohorts (risk difference: 3.5% [95% CI: -2.6, 9.7], p = 0.26).

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: Diagnosis of atrioventricular block in the emergency department [^1167sXcF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with bradycardia are commonly encountered by the emergency physician. Among the possible bradydysrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks (AVB) represent a significant portion of these presentations. In this article, we provide four illustrative cases of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with AVB. We review the various types of AV block dysrhythmias (1st, 2nd, and 3rd degrees) and their underlying etiologies. This discussion also focuses on the presentation, clinical considerations, management, and acute treatment of AVB dysrhythmias in the emergent setting.

### Epclusa [^111LcCKy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious symptomatic bradycardia when coadministered with amiodarone: Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, including those requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI® [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to two weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with the coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with EPCLUSA is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered EPCLUSA:

- **Counsel patients**: About the risk of symptomatic bradycardia.
- **Cardiac monitoring**: In-patient monitoring for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first two weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking EPCLUSA and need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone require continued monitoring.

### Atropine-resistant bradycardia due to hyperkalaemia [^112hmc6e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Symptomatic sinus bradycardia is routinely treated in the emergency department with atropine and pacing. Two cases are presented that illustrate the importance of considering hyperkalaemia, particularly in the presence of atropine-resistant symptomatic bradycardia. The administration of calcium in such cases acts to stabilize the myocardium and resolve the bradycardia. Blood gas analysis provides a rapid estimate of serum potassium concentrations, facilitating timely treatment.
