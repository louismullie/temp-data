## Question

12.370. The base of the pyramid is a right-angled triangle, one of whose acute angles is α. All lateral edges are equally inclined to the plane of the base. Find the dihedral angles at the base if the height of the pyramid is equal to the hypotenuse of the triangle lying in its base.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the dihedral angles at the base of a pyramid whose base is a right-angled triangle with an acute angle α, where all lateral edges are equally inclined to the base plane and the pyramid's height equals the hypotenuse of the base triangle. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and what "equally inclined lateral edges" implies for the apex position. Then, I should verify how the height constraint relates the pyramid's height to the base triangle's hypotenuse. Next, I will derive expressions for the slant heights and the dihedral angles using trigonometry. Finally, I will check special cases and ensure the solution is consistent with the problem constraints.

> Let me first confirm the base geometry and notation. The base is a right-angled triangle ABC with right angle at C, acute angle α at vertex A, and therefore the other acute angle is 90° − α at vertex B. The hypotenuse AB has length c, the side opposite α is BC = c sin α, and the adjacent side is AC = c cos α, which sets the base dimensions in terms of c and α.

> Now, I need to ensure I interpret "all lateral edges equally inclined to the plane of the base" correctly. This condition implies that the apex S projects to the circumcenter of the base triangle, because only then do all lateral edges SA, SB, SC make the same angle with the base plane. For a right-angled triangle, the circumcenter lies at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, so the foot of the altitude from S is the midpoint M of AB, and SM is the height of the pyramid, which I'll denote as h.

> Wait, let me verify the height constraint. The problem states the height of the pyramid equals the hypotenuse of the base triangle, so h = c. That means SM = AB = c, which is a key relationship I will use to relate slant heights and angles in the lateral faces.

> Next, I should review the dihedral angle definition. The dihedral angle at a base edge is the angle between the base plane and the lateral face containing that edge. To compute it, I can drop a perpendicular from the apex projection M to the edge, which gives the apothem of the base relative to that edge, and then use a right triangle formed by the pyramid's height, the apothem, and the slant height to find the desired angle.

> I will now examine the dihedral angle at edge AC. Let me consider the perpendicular from M to AC; call the foot P. Then MP is the apothem for edge AC, and in right triangle SMP, the dihedral angle at AC is the angle between SM and SP, which is ∠SPM. I should double-check the trigonometry: tan(∠SPM) = SM / MP, so ∠SPM = arctan(SM / MP). I need to express MP in terms of c and α. Since M is the midpoint of AB and AC = c cos α, and by similar triangle reasoning or coordinate geometry, MP = (1/2) BC = (1/2) c sin α, so ∠SPM = arctan(c / [(1/2) c sin α]) = arctan(2 / sin α).

> Hold on, I should verify the dihedral angle at edge BC similarly. Let Q be the foot of the perpendicular from M to BC. Then MQ is the apothem for edge BC, and in right triangle SMQ, the dihedral angle at BC is ∠SQM, with tan(∠SQM) = SM / MQ. By symmetry and the base geometry, MQ = (1/2) AC = (1/2) c cos α, so ∠SQM = arctan(c / [(1/2) c cos α]) = arctan(2 / cos α).

> I need to check the dihedral angle at the hypotenuse AB. Since M lies on AB, the apothem for AB is zero, which means the lateral face SAB is perpendicular to the base plane. Therefore, the dihedral angle at AB is 90 degrees. Let me reconsider to ensure I'm not missing a subtlety: yes, when the apex projects onto an edge, the face containing that edge is perpendicular to the base, so the angle is indeed 90°.

> Let me summarize the three dihedral angles at the base. The dihedral angle at AC is arctan(2 / sin α), the dihedral angle at BC is arctan(2 / cos α), and the dihedral angle at AB is 90°. I should confirm that these expressions are dimensionless and depend only on α, which they do, and that they satisfy intuitive limits as α varies.

> But wait, what if α is 45°? In that isosceles right-triangle case, sin α = cos α = √2/2, so both arctan expressions become arctan(2 / (√2/2)) = arctan(2√2) ≈ 70.53°, and the hypotenuse angle remains 90°, which seems geometrically reasonable. If α approaches 0°, the angle at AC approaches arctan(∞) = 90° while the angle at BC approaches arctan(2), and vice versa as α approaches 90°, which aligns with the triangle becoming very flat in one direction and the corresponding lateral face becoming steep.

> Final answer: The dihedral angles at the base are arctan(2 / sin α) at the edge opposite angle α, arctan(2 / cos α) at the edge adjacent to angle α, and 90° at the hypotenuse.

---

The dihedral angles at the base of the pyramid are **arctan(2/sin α)** along the leg opposite α, **arctan(2/cos α)** along the leg adjacent to α, and **90°** along the hypotenuse. These results follow from the fact that the apex projects to the circumcenter of the right-angled base (midpoint of the hypotenuse), and the height equals the hypotenuse, yielding slant heights that depend on the base triangle's acute angle α.

---

## Geometric setup and key properties

- **Base triangle**: right-angled triangle ABC with right angle at C, acute angle α at A, hypotenuse AB = c.
- **Pyramid height**: h = c (given).
- **Apex projection**: since all lateral edges are equally inclined to the base, the apex S projects to the circumcenter of the base, which for a right triangle is the midpoint M of the hypotenuse AB.
- **Slant heights**: the slant heights to the legs are the distances from S to AC and BC, and to the hypotenuse is the height h itself.

---

## Dihedral angle along the hypotenuse (AB)

The lateral face SAB contains the hypotenuse AB and the apex S. Since the apex projects to the midpoint of AB, the plane SAB is perpendicular to the base, so the dihedral angle at AB is **90°**.

---

## Dihedral angles along the legs (AC and BC)

For a leg (say AC), the dihedral angle is the angle between the base and the lateral face SAC. This is the angle between the base and the slant height to AC, which can be found using the right triangle formed by the height, the apothem from M to AC, and the slant height.

- **Apothem to AC**: the distance from M to AC is half the length of the leg opposite α, i.e. (c sin α)/2.
- **Slant height to AC**: by Pythagoras, √(h² + [(c sin α)/2]²) = √(c² + (c² sin² α)/4) = (c/2)√(4 + sin² α).
- **Dihedral angle**: tan θ = h / [(c sin α)/2] = c / [(c sin α)/2] = 2/sin α, so θ = arctan(2/sin α).

Similarly, for the leg BC, the apothem is (c cos α)/2, and the dihedral angle is **arctan(2/cos α)**.

---

## Summary of dihedral angles

| **Edge** | **Dihedral angle** |
|-|-|
| Hypotenuse (AB) | 90° |
| Leg opposite α (BC) | arctan(2/cos α) |
| Leg adjacent to α (AC) | arctan(2/sin α) |

---

Thus, the dihedral angles at the base are **arctan(2/sin α)** along the leg opposite α, **arctan(2/cos α)** along the leg adjacent to α, and **90°** along the hypotenuse.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^111VAeX4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Such a crease pattern has a a rigid folding mechanism that we parameterize via the dihedral angle γ from which the remaining dihedral angles shown in Fig. 3 C. (θ, θ ″ ≡ 2 π − θ, ψ, and ψ ″ ≡ 2 π − ψ) are determined. We compute the coarse-grained fundamental forms for a generic ground state then we use the mean curvature to determine the radius and the Jacobian to determine the characteristic height:We find the components of the fundamental forms exactly match those shown in Eqn. ((1), (2), (3)). We denote the number of cells in the azimuthal direction as N 1 and the number of cells in the axial direction as N 2, then identify the instantaneous bounds of the coordinates in our continuum approximation as 0 ≤ φ ≤ N 1 η (γ) and 0 ≤ z ≤ N 2 h (γ). Consequently, the configuration manifold is bounded by the closure condition of the faces γ = π shown in Fig. 3 F and the closure condition of the cylinder N 1 η = 2 π shown in Fig. 3 H. We find these conditions restrict the space of viable configurations and system sizes, but we do not provide a thorough exploration of the design space in this work. We write the explicit expressions for the geometry along the rigid folding mechanism in Methods, Arc-Morph Geometry. We show the radius as a function of the height along the configuration manifold in Fig. 3 E, and use the inset to highlight a change in slope after the cylinder reaches its maximum height as shown in Fig. 3 G. Since we have explicit formulae for the radius and the height, it is straightforward to expand the fundamental forms about infinitesimal changes to the dihedral angle γ along the rigid mechanism (see Supplementary Note 5). However, we utilize our framework for the rigid isometry to compare it with existing methods.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^112HgXvj]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Direct chiroptical correlation of dissymmetric crystal morphologies [^1148VY25]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One of the best views of the morphology comes from X-ray microtomography (microCT; Fig. 2D). Some of these crystals have several curious features. (1) The bipyramids are longer on the bottom than on the top, as pictured in Figs. 1 B2 and 2D. The length of the top pyramid is 75–80% of the bottom. (2) The bottom pyramid is more acute than the top, albeit this apparent angle depends upon the azimuth of the micrograph with respect to the vertical axis. The angle of the top pyramid is near 55° in projection, whereas the angle in the bottom pyramid is closer to 45°. These morphologies are consistent with the polar point group 6, as opposed to 622 where the top and bottom are equivalent. The sense of this axis could be a consequence of differences in mass transport that make some crystals appear polar. (3) The interfacial edges that separate the top and bottom pyramids have long and short bounding edges, horizontal and inclined, respectively. We have found that the best way to approximate this intersectionis with two types of pyramids: the bottom pyramid with isohedral facesand the top pyramid with enantiomorphous faces either {122} or {212}. In contrast, symmetry 622 with twelve {111} facets, i.e. symmetry 6 with six {111} facets and sixfacets, would give a bipyramid with edges between the large faces of top and bottom pyramids nearly parallel to the intersecting planes. The crystal face assignments been validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. S4). Interpenetrated twinned crystals (RR, LL, and RL) were also observed as clearly seen by micro-CT (Fig. S5).

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^113LJPsb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We repeat this analysis for the nonrigid isometry which we cannot describe in terms of changes to the dihedral angles exclusively. Since this crease pattern falls within the broader set of TBO that our theory applies to, the nonrigid isometry is represented by the vertex amplitudesand the face amplitudes. We again integrate the changes in the lattice vectors and the lattice rotation matrices, then average according to our coarse-graining procedure to find:where we determine σ 1 and σ 2 directly fromandand find that the diagonal components of the strain vanish: ε φ φ = ε z z = 0. We confirm these quantities are self consistent with δ I φ z = δ I z φ = R 2 σ 1 + σ 2, δ I I φ z = δ I I z φ = R σ 1 without any adjustment to the averaging step of our coarse-graining procedure. Here, there is an apparent discrepancy regarding the units of σ 1 and σ 2: from dimensional analysis of Eqn. (7), σ 1 must have units of inverse area and σ 2 must be dimensionless. However, our calculations leading to Eqns. ((15), (16)) use a dimensionless face amplitude to simplify our calculations while the integration framework assumes the face amplitude has units of inverse length. This is in contrast to the vertex amplitudes which are always dimensionless. Introducing such a length scale, for example from the square root of the cell area, resolves the apparent discrepancy. The self consistency of our results relies on both the averaging process in our coarse-graining method and the inclusion of the Jacobian to transform from the discrete lattice coordinates to the continuous surface coordinates. While for the nonrigid isometries of parallelogram-based origami the averaging is also important, the Jacobian may be neglected because the ground states are quasi-planar.

### Spiral phyllotaxis predicts left-right asymmetric growth and style deflection in mirror-image flowers of cyanella alba [^116PqcWQ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To test the feasibility of this mechanism and investigate the contribution of differential elongation of different carpel walls, we developed a biophysical model of the C. alba pistil. Our aim was to test whether differential elongation of different carpels can drive style deflection to the extent observed in C. alba ovaries. As individual ovaries varied substantially in size and shape, we opted for a model that captures organ shape in a simple description, to which we could fit the individual ovaries, rather than a model reproducing realistic organ shapes. To this end, we developed a bead-spring model with as few springs per carpel as possible to capture the essence of the developmental process. Bead-spring mechanical models are well-suited for identifying differential growth patterns without the need for complex geometries or full organ-level modelling. We used a three-dimensional polyhedral model to represent the ovary, which is composed of a triangular prism topped by a truncated pyramid (Fig. 3C and Supporting Information Text; Figs. S3, S4; Tables S2 –S 8). Deflection of the truncated face of the pyramid such that it is no longer parallel to the base of the triangular prism indicates style deflection. We applied this model to images of six ovaries in two steps. First, we identified for each ovary the "target" polyhedron whose two-dimensional side view most accurately represented the ovary in its later stages of development (see Fig. 3B–E, and Figs. S3, S4). The resulting solid figures were skewed at the top, reflecting the differential carpel elongation responsible for stylar deflection. Second, we searched for the parameters that most closely reproduced the target polyhedron as a bead-spring system at its dynamic equilibrium, with the polyhedron edges as springs (Fig. 3F). We allowed different elongation (increase in resting length) and stiffness in the springs on the carpel 1 (Fig. 4A; the adaxial carpel opposite the direction of style deflection) vs carpel 2 (the adaxial carpel on the side to which the style deflects) and carpel 3 (the abaxial carpel) sides compared to a symmetric polyhedron based on very-early bud measurements (Fig. S5A, B, Table S4 and Supporting Text). We used random search optimisation algorithms, to identify the parameters of our mechanistic model that best reproduced the target polyhedron and, hence, of the ovary of C. alba during the late developmental stage (Figs. 3, S 5, S 6, Table S6).

### Trigonometry in daily ultrasound practice [^1167YmMJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have read with interest the editorial by Piton et al. regarding application of Pythagoras' theorem in central venous cannulation. Geometry is at the base of our daily life and we should apply his theorems and axioms to obtain the best result in our daily practice.

We believe that trigonometry is another important branch of geometry in addition to Pythagoras' theorem that has to be taken into consideration while performing invasive procedures under ultrasound guidance. Sine, cosine and tangent are the basis of trigonometry, they represent the ratio between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Sin(α) is the ratio between side B and the hypotenuse (H) (Fig. 1), Cos(α) is the ratio between side A and the hypotenuse (H), and Tan(α) is the ratio between side B and side A. It is important to note that, for a given angle α, the ratio between the sides is unconnected from the triangle size.

Fig. 1
Internal jugular vein ultrasound anatomy. H hypotenuse; A and B are catheti of the triangle

As already stated by Piton, in our ultrasound daily practice, we constantly build right-angled triangles: the hypotenuse is the needle route, side A is the distance measured on the skin between needle insertion point and target projection on the skin, and side B is the depth of the target.

Side B is determined by the patient's anatomy and the operator cannot modify it. As reported by Schulman et al. needle/skin angulation between 30° and 45° is considered to be ideal while performing ultrasound procedure.

Trigonometry is helpful in determining which targets can be reached with such needle angulation. At 45° angulation tan(α) is equal to 1, meaning that side A and side B have to be equal. For example, if our target jugular internal vein is 2 cm deep, the needle has to be inserted 2 cm from the target. Generalizing, we have a good needle visualization whenever Tan(α) ≤ 1 with side B equal to or shorter than side A.

In conclusion, physicians have to take into account target depth while choosing the ultrasound linear probe of appropriate size to be able to visualize all needle routes and the needle skin entrance site.

### Emergent geometry and duality in the carbon nucleus [^113dFy9H]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The carbon atom provides the backbone for the complex organic chemistry composing the building blocks of life. The physics of the carbon nucleus in its predominant isotope, 12 C, is similarly full of multifaceted complexity. Here we provide a model-independent density map of the geometry of the nuclear states of 12 C using the ab initio framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory. We find that the well-known but enigmatic Hoyle state is composed of a "bent-arm" or obtuse triangular arrangement of alpha clusters. We identify all of the low-lying nuclear states of 12 C as having an intrinsic shape composed of three alpha clusters forming either an equilateral triangle or an obtuse triangle. The states with the equilateral triangle formation also have a dual description in terms of particle-hole excitations in the mean-field picture.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^111qMwK3]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular access is routinely performed by critical care physicians and the use of ultrasonography is recommended. However, complications during vessel puncture are not rare, particularly for residents in training with low levels of experience. Reminding about the properties of the isosceles right triangle might be of interest to teach young fellows a secure step by step technique for vessel catheterization.

An isosceles right triangle has two equal legs and has angles of 90°, 45° and 45°. For two equal legs having the length ɭ, the hypotenuse has a length corresponding to ɭ × √2. This last number, also called Pythagoras' constant, corresponds approximately to 1.4. After a longitudinal scan of the vein run, let's insert the needle in the skin, just over the vein (Fig. 1a). Let's position the probe perpendicular to the skin, just over the vein, at a length ɭ of the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vein under the probe. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe.

Fig. 1
Global overview of ultrasound-guided vessel puncture and use of the isosceles right triangle. a Taking a distance between the probe and the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vessel, a probe perpendicular to the skin, and an angle between the skin and the needle of 45°, the third angle will be automatically positioned into the vein. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe. b The long-axis plane, which passes through the length of the vessel, corresponds to the view obtained in the in-plane technique with the vessel in the long-axis. Three points determine the long-axis plane: the needle insertion point, identified by inserting the needle in the skin just above the vessel, the vessel being viewed in the long axis; the middle of the probe on the skin, the vessel being visualized at the center of the ultrasound screen in the short axis; the middle of the probe's top, the probe being perpendicular to the skin. The operator should attempt to maintain the syringe in the axis of the probe top (dotted line)

Nuclear density distributions for several 12 C states using the SU(4) interaction.

a – f Results for the density distribution of the two inner angles of the triangle formed by the three alpha clusters for the, states respectively. The two axes are for the two inner angles θ 1 and θ 2 measured in degrees. g – l Results for the two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the, states respectively. In each case the orientation of the shortest root-mean-square direction is aligned with the x axis.

We now define a model-independent two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the states of 12 C. In order to construct this projection, we first identify the x axis as the direction with the smallest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the center of mass. For the nuclear states that we have already identified as having an equilateral triangular shape, we rotate the density configurations along the x axis so that one of the three clusters is pointing along the positive z direction. We then symmetrize with respect to 0°, 120° and 240° rotations about the x axis. For nuclear states that we have already identified as having an obtuse isosceles shape, we identify the z axis as the direction with the longest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the CM. We then rotate the density configurations along the z axis so that the alpha cluster closest to the CM lies on the positive y axis.

In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show the density distribution of selected states of 12 C for the SU(4) interaction. The density distributions obtained using the N2LO chiral interaction are presented in Fig. 3 and the Supplementary Information and are in excellent agreement with the SU(4) interaction results. The, andstates (see Supplementary Information for the last two) have similar intrinsic equilateral triangular shapes, consistent with an interpretation as members of a rotational band built on top of thestate. The, states (see Supplementary Information for the last one) have similar intrinsic obtuse isosceles triangle shapes and are consistent with belonging to a rotational band built on top of thestate. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the literature based on group theoretical considerations. We note that models where the Hoyle state has an equilateral triangle symmetry predict an additional 3 − and 4 − state in the Hoyle state rotational band.

### Ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture with a horizontal and perpendicular paramedian approach based on positioning in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy: a case report and technical description [^113z3BJg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Then the transverse scan is performed by positioning the probe perpendicular to the long axis of the spine. To obtain a normalized transverse view, a rocking maneuver was required which indicates an angled median approach (Fig. 2 d-f). To make the angle of needle insertion easier to grasp, we introduced a LP's triangle model to convert this angled approach to a horizontal path right to the center of the thecal sac. The right triangle's hypotenuse is the angled median approach, while its base is the horizontal paramedian approach and its height is the lateral offset from the midline. To locate this needle entry point, the probe was held perpendicularly to the edge of the bed at the marked interspace, parallel to the floor as verified by a spirit level attached on the probe, with the dural sac centering on the ultrasound screen (Fig. 2 g-i). The intersection of the midpoints of the probe's long and short edges was used as the needle entry point. After local infiltration, a 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted horizontally and perpendicularly to the edge of the bed. There was only one needle pass with a 30-second procedure time (defined as the time from first spinal needle contact to the skin to visualization of the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid) and nusinersen was successfully injected intrathecally. In accordance with the recommended dosing schedule, the nusinersen injection was performed on treatment days 0, 14, 28, and 63 (four loading dosing) followed by maintenance doses every 4 months thereafter for this patient. Therefore, this patient experienced a total of eight lumbar punctures during a period of 18 months. Using this approach of horizontal and perpendicular needle trajectory, first-pass success and first-attempt success was achieved during the following seven nusinersen administrations. For all the eight lumbar punctures, the median locating time (from when the probe was first placed on the skin until the skin marking was complete) was 10.8 min [IQR, 7.8–13.7 min; range, 6 to 17 min], with a procedure time of 36 s [IQR, 30–42 s; range, 28 to 60 s]. The median depth of needle insertion was 5.3 cm [IQR, 5.2–5.5 cm; range, 5.1 to 5.5 cm]. No adverse events were observed during the procedure and within three post-dural puncture days. Both the patient and the proceduralists expressed satisfaction with the ease of injection.

### Stability bounds on superluminal propagation in active structures [^117CmmMA]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For any real frequency, the transmission phaseis given bywhere the anglesare defined as the acute vertex formed by the-plane points[see Fig. 3(a)], and we split the phase into the free-space component and the one due to. The amplitude at a given frequency is the product of the distance from the zeros divided by the product of the distance from the poles, i.e.

The pole defines the bandwidth, and it is located at. The maximum advance-bandwidth product is found to be 3/2. For unitary transmission at, the zero must lie on the red curve in the figure, along which the maximum value is. The corresponding pole-zero pairs also exist at mirror positions around the imaginary axis. The solid black lines indicate (unequal, for illustrative purposes) contours of.

The group delay, written as the sum of the delays in free space and in the structure. The zeros contribute negatively to the group delay when in the lower half-plane, and the poles positively. In order to yield a broadband negative delay, the zeros should be optimally tailored to support a broadband response (with bandwidth increasing as the zero moves away from the real axis), but also have a fast angular derivative over the bandwidth of interest (implying they should not be too far from the axis). At the same time, to minimize the positive delays introduced by the poles, they should be positioned to have a small angular derivative over the operating bandwidth. This can either be achieved with poles with large negativevalues, or placed near the-axis outside the frequency range. In the former case, the amplitude in the superluminal regime will be small, as in the case of anomalous dispersion in the presence of large losses. The latter requires active structures, as the system will exhibit gain at frequencies near the pole.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^114ksHcf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the posteriorly inclined segment in the sagittal profile of the spine was hypothesized to be a risk factor for scoliosis development. In order to study this hypothesis, the length and tilt angle of the posteriorly inclined segment were analyzed on sagittal standing full-spine radiographs that were made before the onset of scoliosis. To capture both the length and the tilt angle, we developed the concept of the "posteriorly inclined triangle" (PIT) (Fig. 1). This triangle can have different shapes depending on the length and inclination of the hypotenuse, but its surface area is an expression of the overall magnitude of the posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors. This concept was first explored in a pilot study that included sample size calculations that we used in the current study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the sagittal shape of the spine before the onset of scoliosis can predict later scoliosis development in the population of patients with 22q11.2DS. We hypothesized that the children who ultimately develop scoliosis have more posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors acting on their spine, as expressed by a larger PIT area. In addition, we expected that the shape of the initial triangle (the inclination of the hypotenuse) determines which vertebrae are at risk for rotating into scoliosis, and is thus related to the ultimate type of scoliotic curve that develops.

### X-ray linear dichroic tomography of crystallographic and topological defects [^114HXVDd]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Origin of linear dichroism in α-V 2 O 5

V 2 O 5 has a layered orthorhombic crystal structure consisting of distorted [VO 5] pyramids, shown schematically in Fig. 1b. These pyramids tile along the a – b plane and are bound with van der Waals interactions along the c axis. The apical, vanadyl bond of these pyramids, aligned with the crystallographic c axis, is shorter (1.57 Å) compared with the bonds on the base of the pyramid (1.87 Å). This shorter bond breaks the symmetry of an otherwise regular square pyramid. To examine the spatial orientation of the apical bond and, in turn, the orientation of entire grains and deviations within them, the energy of the incident X-rays was set to that of the vanadium K pre-edge peak. This peak arises from the V (1 s) to V (4p-3d) transition, more specifically, to V (3d e g + 4 p) + O 2p z mixing states, which become accessible as a result of the deviation of the V coordination from the octahedral symmetry. When the apical bond is parallel to the direction of the electric field of the incident X-rays, the interaction is strong, as the transition V (1 s) to V (4p-3d) is allowed. When the apical bond is instead perpendicular to the incident polarization, the interaction is weaker. An illustration of the different absorption strengths that result from the relative orientation between the incident X-ray polarization and the apical bond, known as linear dichroism, is shown in Fig. 1b. The X-ray near-edge absorption and phase spectra of V 2 O 5 measured using LH and LV polarizations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 and a schematic of the layered crystal structure is provided in ref.

In the above-described relationship between the polarization state of the illumination and the examined asymmetry or anisotropy, the linearly polarized light acts as a 'search light' for the resonant bond to which the polarization is parallel. This relationship applies, in principle, to all cases of natural linear dichroism. The connection between the investigated anisotropy orientation and the unit-cell orientation of the material can be obtained through the use of reference samples, as showcased in 2D linear dichroic microscopy applications, and is already available in the literature for numerous materials. It can also be readily determined with previous knowledge of the material's crystal structure (or molecular arrangement).

### Measuring osteotomy wedge angle is more important than measuring wedge height in open wedge osteotomies around the knee in preoperative planning [^114CjzPn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Medial open wedge proximal tibial osteotomy is planned following lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Per case, 27 osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and nine hinge points (A–C). Osteotomy entry points as well as hinge points were determined in a standardized fashion in a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Twenty‐one variations of DFO, each combining a different hinge and entry point, were planned to adjust the WBL to align with 50.0% of the tibial plateau's width, measured from the medial edge of the plateau (Figure 3). Conversely, a standardized coordinate system was defined to determine hinge and entry points (Figure 3). Osteotomy B7 was considered the optimal hinge position.

Figure 3
Lateral open wedge distal femur osteotomy is planned after initial lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Twenty‐one osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and seven hinge points (A–C). Points were determined standardized on a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Of each planned osteotomy, the osteotomy depth and wedge height were measured manually. The widths of the tibia and femur were measured at their widest diameters, parallel to the tibial or femoral joint line. The correction angle, as well as the mechanical lateral distal femur angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibia angle (MPTA), joint line convergence angle (JLCA) and mFA‐mTA, were calculated using the mediCAD® software.

Mathematical prediction of wedge height

The wedge height was calculated using a formula based on the correction angle and osteotomy depth. In opening osteotomies, the wedge forms an isosceles triangle comprising two congruent right‐angled triangles, with the hypotenuses representing the osteotomy depth and the alpha angle being half the opening angle. Wedge height, calculated using the sine function, is the sum of the opposite sides relative to the hinge point (Figure 4). Example calculations are in Table 1. The wedge height was both manually measured and mathematically calculated, and deviations were determined.

Figure 4
The osteotomy wedge is an isosceles triangle consisting of two identical congruent right‐angled triangles. Using the sine function, the wedge height can be calculated as displayed.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^1176z4TG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Nested helicoids in biological microstructures [^115ssvbJ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Another so-far unnoticed structural feature also appears from our observations: in addition to the twist angle, the laminae are progressively rotated upward and downward ('tilted') out-of-plane, reminiscent of a handheld fan. This is seen for example in Fig. 2c, e, where the midplane lamina of a BLU is roughly parallel to the xy plane, whereas the laminae close to the top and bottom of the BLU tend to be perpendicular to the xy plane. Thus, the tilting angle starts from 0° at the midplane lamina and reaches about ± 90° turn close to the interlayers. Accordingly, the total tilt angle is about 180°, and the tilting angular increment of each lamina is about 1.8°–4.5° depending on the number of laminae, approximately the same as that of the twisting angle. The tilting axis is orthogonal to the z -axis (that is, parallel to the xy plane), and is located within the plane of each lamina, coinciding with the axis of the innermost fiber (the fiber that intersects the twisting axis). Thus, the tilting axis is a local axis within a lamina, running through one of its edges. Because all the fibers in the lamina seem to lie parallel to each other (see for example the exposed laminae edges in Fig. 2f), they remain parallel to the xy plane regardless of the twist and tilt angles. Note that the orientation of the xy plane and the z -axis is globally fixed with respect to the samples, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and is not affected by either twisting or tilting.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^1126F8Dz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

The PIT

All of the radiographic measurements were performed with Surgimap imaging software (version 2.3.2.1; Nemaris), which has been validated for measuring spinopelvic parameters. A single trained observer blinded to the outcome analyzed the freestanding lateral full-spine radiographs, which had been made in a standardized manner, of every patient at inclusion. At that time, all of the patients were skeletally immature, and those with scoliosis on the coronal radiograph were excluded. First, the observer utilized Surgimap's Spinal Wizard software to segment both femoral heads and all vertebral body end plates; manual adjustments were made where necessary (Fig. 1). Second, the software automatically calculated the inclination of each vertebral body based on the upper end plate in the sagittal plane, and the centroids of the most cranial and most caudal posteriorly inclined vertebrae were annotated. Third, the right-angled triangle between these 2 points and the vertical was drawn, and 3 parameters were determined: (1) the PIT area was calculated with the basic formula formula for the area of a triangle, 0.5 × width × height, (2) the PIT length was calculated as the length of the hypotenuse, and (3) the PIT inclination was calculated as the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical (Fig. 1). Finally, the pelvic incidenceand the length of the spine from T1 to S1 were measured, also in the sagittal plane, using the same Surgimap software. The T1-S1 spinal length was used to normalize the PIT area to account for absolute body size. This was done by calculating the ratio between the T1-S1 length of each patient and the study's population mean, with no distinction between sexes since the T1-S1 length was not significantly different between boys and girls. Using this ratio allowed the PIT area and the PIT length to be normalized for the patient's size but still retain their physical units (cm and cm 2).

### The ambiguity of names and landmarks in radiographs of the pediatric pelvis: variations and a historical perspective [^113uEYLJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The definition of landmarks is brief in these original articles, and after describing the horizontal line that now bears his name (Figure 2), Hilgenreiner simply states, "In addition I determine the acetabular angle — which is the angle formed by the more-or-less inclined acetabulum with the above-mentioned line".

Kleinberg and Liebermanndescribed the measurement as follows: "The acetabular index is the angle formed between the roof or iliac portion of the acetabulum and a horizontal line passing through the triradiate cartilages".

Sharp introduced a different acetabular angle in 1950 that has gained widespread use (Figure 3) (according to Tönnis, an equivalent parameter was introduced by Ullman already in 1939, but this is less well-known. We were unable to find that reference in the original form). Sharp focused on adult patients and wrote, "In the radiograph of the normal acetabulum only two points lend themselves readily to mensuration, namely the lateral edge of the acetabular roof and the inferior tip of what commonly is known as the pelvic tear drop. Using these two points and the horizontal line between the tear drops, the angle of inclination of the acetabulum can be measured — the acetabular angle".

Figure 3
Diagram showing an adult pelvis. In this adult pelvis, the horizontal line is drawn from the base of the teardrops, although other reference points have been described. On the right side (Dx), Sharp angle is measured from the teardrop to the bony edge with the black line X (AA-c) and in the modified manner to the edge of the sourcil with the green Y line (AA-m). On the left hip, Tönnis angle is visualized using the red Z line. The horizontal line is parallel to Hilgenreiner' line while the second line extends from the medial to the lateral aspects of the sourcil.

This angle has since often been referred to as "Sharp angle" to distinguish it from the angles described earlier; however, some publications refer to it by other names (Figure 1).

### 2006 to 2019 story; percutaneously implantable aortic valve prototypes [^117PPHud]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

To construct the valve, ten parameters were taken into consideration; radius of the base and commissures, height of the valve, angle of free edge to the plane through the three commissures, angle of the bottom surface of leaflet to the plane through the three commissures, coaptation height at the centre, commissural height, length of the leaflet free edge, length of the leaflet in the radial direction, sinus depth and sinus height. These dimensions do not stay constant; they change as a function of aortic pressure and time during each heart cycle. The change in function shows that the aortic valve has a dynamic configuration. For example, the radius of the base and the bottom surface angle slightly increases in response to a rise in pressure however the valve height remains consistent, and the coaptation height remarkably decreases.

Five parameters are of main focus when designing an aortic valve. They are the radius of the base, radius of the commissures, valve height, commissures height and the angle of the open leaflet to the vertical known as Beta.

Also, it is vital to know the composing features of a valve. Firstly the leaflet must be cylindrical. The free edge of the open leaflet must lie in a plane passing through the three commissures, and part of the line of the leaflet connection must be vertical. Lastly the leaflet's attachment residual line should also lie on a plane intersection, enabling the leaflet reflection to produce a closed valve.

There are specific optimal values for the parameters which act as reference values. The radius of the base should be 10 mm in length, while the radius of commissures 8.3 mm and the valve height 11.7 mm. The commissure height should be 1.8 mm and the angle Beta 5.6 degrees. It is important to note that these measurements may vary with each valve design.

Objective

Part of the review included a section on the anatomy of the aortic valve and a history and role of TAVR. This is purely for coherence and further benefit of the reader. However, the main objective of this review was to analyse a selected range of developments of transcatheter aortic valve implants over the past 15 years, whilst detailing strengths and weaknesses of each design. The review also provides an outline of how an efficient and effective prosthetic design is produced when using the optimal geometric measurements of the native aortic valve.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^115DPCUb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

### Modeling of the sagittal cervical spine as a method to discriminate hypolordosis: results of elliptical and circular modeling in 72 asymptomatic subjects, 52 acute neck pain subjects, and 70 chronic neck pain subjects [^112k5wrF]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Computer analysis of digitized vertebral body corners on lateral cervical radiographs.

Objectives

Using elliptical and circular modeling, the geometric shape of the path of the posterior bodies of C2-C7 was sought in normal, acute pain, and chronic pain subjects. To determine the least squares error per point for paths of geometric shapes, minor axis to major axis elliptical ratios (b/a), Cobb angles, sagittal balance of C2 above C7, and posterior tangent segmental and global angles.

Summary Of Background Data

When restricted to cervical lordotic configurations, normal, acute pain, and chronic pain subjects have not been compared for similarities or differences of these parameters. Conventional Cobb angles provide only a comparison of the endplates of the distal vertebrae, while geometric modeling provides the shape of the entire sagittal curves, the orientation of the spine, and segmental angles.

Methods

Radiographs of 72 normal subjects, 52 acute neck pain subjects, and 70 chronic neck pain subjects were digitized. For normal subjects, the inclusion criteria were no kyphotic cervical segments, no cranial-cervical symptoms, and less than ± 10 mm horizontal displacement of C2 above C7. In pain subjects, inclusion criteria were no kyphotic cervical segments and less than 25 mm of horizontal displacement of C2 above C7. Measurements included segmental angles, global angles of lordosis (C1-C7 and C2-C7), height-to-length ratios, anterior weight bearing, and from modeling, circular center, and radius of curvature.

Results

In the normal group, a family of ellipses was found to closely approximate the posterior body margins of C2-C7 with a least squares error of less than 1 mm per vertebral body point. The only ellipse/circle found to include T1, with a least squares error of less than 1 mm, was a circle. Compared with the normal group, the pain group's mean radiographic angles were reduced and the radius of curvature was larger. For normal, acute, and chronic pain groups, the mean angles between posterior tangents on C2-C7 were 34.5 degrees, 28.6 degrees, and 22.0 degrees, C2-C7 Cobb angles were 26.8 degrees, 16.5 degrees, and 12.7 degrees, and radius of curvature were r = 132.8 mm, r = 179 mm, and r = 245.4 mm, respectively.

Conclusions

The mean cervical lordosis for all groups could be closely modeled with a circle. Pain groups had hypolordosis and larger radiuses of curvature compared with the normal group. Circular modeling may be a valuable tool in the discrimination between normal lordosis and hypolordosis in normal and pain subjects.

### Distribution of angle alpha in a large population in Eastern China: an analysis of the 30705 eyes using the ray tracing aberrometer [^1157fcHp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Reflecting the current state of knowledge, this study represented the most comprehensive investigation into angle alpha globally to date. By evaluating angle alpha's distribution within a substantial cohort, this research offered critical insights into its variability. Crucially, it established a clear correlation between the magnitude of angle alpha and key demographic factors, including ocular laterality, gender, and age, thereby enriching our understanding of its clinical significance.

In terms of the orientation of angle alpha, the predominant alignment was horizontal, with a particular emphasis on the temporal side, corroborating the findings of several previous research. However, discrepancies emerged in comparing of the magnitude with prior studies, in which the average magnitude of angle alpha was estimated to be around 0.44 and 0.45 mm.

In our study, the overall sample's results showed an average angle alpha magnitude of about 0.30 mm, which is smaller than those observed in other studies. A summary of the angle alpha magnitude in previous studies were shown in Table 4. Our findings indicate that the magnitude of angle alpha is associated with factors such as age, refractive status, and ethnicity. The participants in our study ranged from 10 to 99 years of age, with a large number of myopic young patients. Both the wide age span and the proportion of myopia patients were the major factors leading to the differences with other previous studies. Geometrically, this difference can be intuitively understood, considering that angle alpha represents one side of a right triangle defined by the axial length and the transverse displacement of the fovea of the macula. Consequently, patients with high myopia frequently exhibit a smaller angle alpha.

### Large-scale modular and uniformly thick origami-inspired adaptable and load-carrying structures [^113Zf1n4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this work, we derive necessary conditions for flat foldability and developability of an arbitrary origami vertex consisting of thick panels connected by rotational hinges (see Fig. 2B). Prior research has shown that the loop closure constraint of equivalent spatial linkages provides a necessary condition for rigid foldability in thick origami. This constraint has the following form:where the termis the Denavit-Hartenberg transformation matrix expressed as:

In this matrix, are the sector angles, are the fold angles, andare the thickness offsets (Fig. 2B). For thick origami vertices, we have, because there is no offset in the localaxis. The demonstrated local coordinate convention in Fig. 2B is different from traditional conventions used in prior research of thick origami, where it is common to align the localaxis with the thickness offset. Using this traditional convention prevents us from computing a generalized scalar equation for an arbitrary degree-N origami vertex (see Supplementary Note Section S 2). Instead, the convention presented here uses the right-hand rule, defined by the counterclockwise direction of sector angles, to set up the local coordinates (as shown in Fig. 2B). This convention allows universal representation for sector anglesand fold angles, and embeds a directional sign into the thickness offset. Universal representation for sector anglesand fold anglesare useful for deriving the necessary conditions for developability and flat foldability of arbitrary degree-N thick origami vertices.

For a thick origami to be developable, it needs to satisfy Eq. (1) when no creases are folded. If we setin Eq. (1) the first row of the fourth column will give a thickness-based necessary condition for developability:

The thickness offsetis the distance between adjacent creases when projected to the normal vectorof panel(see Fig. 2B).

To understand Eq. (3), imagine we are walking around a thick vertex (see Fig. 2B left). Each time we move from one panel to the next panel, we need to climb up a positive offset, climb down a negative offset, or stay at the same elevation with. Thus, after walking around the thick vertex, we should return to where we started and recover a zero in the equation (see robust derivation in Supplementary Note Section S 2.1).

### Re-interpreting mesenteric vascular anatomy on 3D virtual and / or physical models, part II: anatomy of relevance to surgeons operating splenic flexure cancer [^111TzqKD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Morphological and morphometric analyses

All distances were measured on 3D virtual models in Osirix using a length tool.

The difference in level between the MCA origin and the IMA origin was named a mesenteric inter-arterial stair. The values measured and the relationship between the values are clarified in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Distance A: From the MCA origin to the IMA origin. Distance B: Parallel to the aorta axis from the IMA origin to the transverse plane through the MCA origin. Distance C: In the transverse plane from the MCA origin to the intersection with Distance B. The angle between the Distance A and Distance B intersection was named Angle AB Vessels MCA middle colic artery, SMA superior mesenteric artery, IMA inferior mesenteric artery

Distance A (oblique distance) was measured from the MCA origin to the IMA origin. Distance B (longitudinal distance) was measured parallel to the aorta axis from the IMA origin to the intersection with the transverse plane through the MCA origin. Distance C (lateral distance) and the angle AB were calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. These lines form a right-angled triangle with the MCA origin in one and the IMA origin in the other vertex.

The angle AB represents the direction, distance A (oblique distance) represents the length, and distance C (lateral distance) represents the height of the mesenteric inter-arterial stair.

The distance from the IMA origin to the LCA origin was measured on the IMA in a stepwise manner along the vessel. Calibres of the vessels were measured at their base, using a length tool, and measuring the largest diameter.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^114BCwDn]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^113CS7yb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,… This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### The alpha angle [^116cv93q]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

➢ The alpha angle was originally defined on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, using a plane, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. However, much of the literature on the alpha angle has used radiographs or other imaging modalities to quantify the alpha angle.➢ The measurement of the alpha angle can be unreliable, particularly on radiographs and ultrasound.➢ If radiographs are used to measure the alpha angle, the circle of best-fit method should be used on multiple different views to capture various locations of the cam lesion, and "eyeballing" or estimating the alpha angle should be avoided.➢ The cam lesion is a dynamic and 3-dimensional (3D) problem and is unlikely to be adequately defined or captured by a single angle.➢ Modern technology, including readily available 3D imaging modalities, as well as intraoperative and dynamic imaging options, provides novel, and potentially more clinically relevant, ways to quantify the alpha angle.

### International consensus statement on nomenclature and classification of the congenital bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy, for clinical, surgical, interventional and research purposes [^112jN86h]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Definition and identification of congenital bicuspid aortic valve — The congenital BAV is most commonly diagnosed by base-of-the-heart short-axis aortic valve imaging with TTE, ECG-gated CCT or CMR, demonstrating the existence of only 2 cusps, with only 2 commissures; on echocardiographic long-axis imaging, systolic doming of the conjoined cusp may be appreciated particularly for right-left coronary cusp fusion but is less reliable for other phenotypes. The diagnosis can also be made by direct surgical observation and pathological examination, and a tricuspid aortic valve that is fibrotic and calcified or rheumatic may present a pattern of acquired fusion of 2 cusps that may be difficult to differentiate from congenital BAV. In the operating theatre the surgeon can define the congenital bicuspid nature by noting a 'pseudocommissure' whose height is lower within the root than the true commissures; additional inspection features include the angle between fused cusps (obtuse: congenital fusion; acute: acquired fusion) and the cleavage plane on the ventricular aspect of fused cusps (absent: congenital; present: acquired). In severely calcified valves, it is critical to utilize information provided by the surgeon and especially the pathologist to determine the presence of a congenital BAV.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^114GDJEN]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

More generally, we can imagine adjusting this criterion in various directions. For example, we could require that a and c are not independent of n but have a mild n dependence. In the Supplementary Information, we mention a boundthat was proved in the context of nilpotent Lie groups of the formwhere 0 < α < 1. This implies that the fractional error vanishes at large d at a rate no slower than d α −1. This is a stronger statement than equation (22) if c is left unspecified, but it is a slightly weaker statement than equation (22) if it requires c = 1.

In the context of discrete groups, an elementary result is that the coarse geometry defined by the Cayley graph is independent of the choice of generating set. That is, we can consider a group G that is generated by some set of easy elements g 1, …, g k. The distance from the identity to some group element g is the minimum length of the word formed from g 1, …, g k that expresses g. Although the metric depends on the choice of generating set (or more generally, the penalty factors associated with each group element), the claim is that different choices of generating sets give distance functions that satisfy equation (22). Furthermore, we can consider properties of the geometry that depend on only the equivalence class. A particularly interesting property is δ -hyperbolicity, which is a notion of negative curvature that applies even in this discrete context. We can identify negative curvature by observing that all triangles in negatively curved spaces are slim — that is, any point on one side of the triangle is close to some point on another side of the triangle, with the maximum separation set by the curvature scale. This property defines what is known as Gromov hyperbolic groupsand is the subject of ongoing mathematical work. A simple example is a free group, where the Cayley graph is an infinite tree. This notion of negative curvature may explain our conjecture that the critical metric has negative sectional curvatures. In particular, the notion of δ -hyperbolicity shows that the concept of large-scale curvature is not a contradiction. In the context of Lie groups, we expect that although many members of a given equivalence class exhibit extreme local curvatures, their large-scale curvatures (for example, that probed by large triangles) should approximately agree with the large-scale curvatures of the critical metric.

### The emergence of three-dimensional chiral domain walls in polar vortices [^115Cy2A2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Explaining the origin of triple points

Whenever a pair of domain walls (β, γ or α, γ or α, β) break the inversion symmetry across α, β or γ domains, we form a triple point pair with the opposite sense of rotation. If the inversion symmetry across α, β or γ domains is not broken, we form triple point pairs with the same sense of rotation. The origin of triple point pairs can be understood by the following hypothesis. Consider an example of the first triple point pair in Fig. 3b. If this particular type of triple point has to be isolated, then the β boundary would infinitely separate the positive and negative chirality regions. If β boundary is not infinite, then it has to meet an α boundary somewhere to continue separating the positive and negative chirality regions. Now, if a β boundary (change in axial polarization) meets an α boundary (change in lateral polarization), a γ boundary appears (change in both lateral and axial polarization). In such a scenario, we get another triple point in the vicinity of the first triple point thus explaining the origins behind the existance of pairs for the majority of cases. α / β boundary could be isolated only in very special circumstances when they are born/die at the surface or they are infinitely long.

### Triangular prism-shaped β-peptoid helices as unique biomimetic scaffolds [^111fdmLF]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

β-Peptoids are peptidomimetics based on N-alkylated β-aminopropionic acid residues (or N-alkyl-β-alanines). This type of peptide mimic has previously been incorporated in biologically active ligands and has been hypothesized to be able to exhibit foldamer properties. Here we show, for the first time, that β-peptoids can be tuned to fold into stable helical structures. We provide high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of homomeric β-peptoid hexamers, which reveal right-handed helical conformations with exactly three residues per turn and a helical pitch of 9.6–9.8Å between turns. The presence of folded conformations in solution is supported by circular dichroism spectroscopy showing length- and solvent dependency, and molecular dynamics simulations provide further support for a stabilized helical secondary structure in organic solvent. We thus outline a framework for future design of novel biomimetics that display functional groups with high accuracy in three dimensions, which has potential for development of new functional materials.

### EAE / ASE recommendations for image acquisition and display using three-dimensional echocardiography [^114oEEG9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular modeling in three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) — landmarks and segmentation are described as follows: "The landmarks used for this process are the mitral annulus and LV apex, which are used to initiate edge detection by semi-automated quantification software". "Other anatomic features of importance are the LV trabeculae and papillary muscles, which should be included within the LV cavity for the calculation of LV volumes". "The 17-segment model distinguishes six segments (inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, lateral, inferolateral, inferior) in the base and six in the mid left ventricle, four segments (septal, anterior, lateral, inferior) in the apex, and the apical cap". In the transverse plane, "the segments comprise 60°, arcs, starting at the midpoint of the septum, which itself is defined by the anterior and posterior RV insertion points of the septum".

### A PET / CT approach to spinal cord metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112HCDbd]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Image analysis

The different spinal canal and SC districts were defined anatomically considering the cervical segment as the region between the skull base and the plane adjacent to the caudal face of the C7 vertebral body. The dorsal segment was defined as the district between this plane and the one adjacent to the caudal face of D12. The sacral and lumbar canal districts were a priori considered free from SC and were thus excluded from the analysis.

Images were analysed according to a previously validated method based on generalization of the Hough transform technique for pattern recognition. According to the original definition, given a pointin the image plane satisfying the equation of a straight linethe Hough transform of P, with respect to the class of straight lines, is the straight line of equationinto the parameter space where the two independent real parameters a, b vary. This definition implies that all points on the line (1) in the image space correspond to lines in the parameter space that all intersect at the point (a, b) uniquely identifying the original line. This correspondence between the image and the parameter spaces holds not only for lines, but also for several classes of algebraic curves. This simple fact inspired the following pattern recognition algorithm for the identification of curves in a digital image:
Apply the traditional Canny edge detection algorithm to extract discontinuities.
Compute the Hough transforms with respect to the selected family of curves of all points in the image plane highlighted by the edge detection process.
Discretize the parameter space into cells whose size is optimized for the specific recognition problem (for the recognition of SC the four-dimensional parameter space is discretized with hypercubes with side equal to 0.02, while for the recognition of the spinal canal the two-dimensional parameter space is discretized with squares with side again 0.02).
Construct an accumulator function defined on the discretized parameter space such that for each cell the value of the accumulator function is equal to the number of Hough transforms passing through that cell.
Search for the parameter values identifying the cell where the accumulator function reaches its maximum.

### Exact, time-dependent analytical equations for spiral trajectories and matching gradient and density-correction waveforms [^115DJXVP]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of "vector" trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### Editorial commentary: is the lateral center-edge angle sufficient for the approximation of acetabular coverage? [^111pnryi]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The lateral center-edge angle is a robust technique with proven clinical applicability for quantifying acetabular coverage. However, it measures only the lateral coverage of the femoral head without consideration of other important portions of the acetabulum such as the anterior or posterior wall. Three-dimensional acetabular coverage measurement techniques capable of quantifying the entire acetabulum have become available, thus posing the question of whether we should still rely on the lateral center-edge angle for the assessment of acetabular coverage.

### International expert consensus statement about methods and indications for keyhole microneurosurgery from international society on minimally invasive neurosurgery [^115Rcc22]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Head position

The patient is placed in the lateral park bench position. The patient's head is rotated about 10°–20° to the contralateral side from the lateral position to provide a direct view angle with less retraction to the cerebellar hemisphere and can open the cerebellopontine angle cistern successfully. During the operation, based on the location of the lesion, the view angle can be adjusted by changing the degree of inclination (left and right) of the operating bed.

Surgical procedures

Starting at the junction line of the external occipital protuberance and mastoid roots, about 1.5–2.0 cm posterior to the mastoid roots, a vertical, oblique (along the hairline) incision, or a horizontal incision of about 4 cm long is made. In the case of craniectomy, a burr hole about 2.5 cm in diameter is created behind the mastoid. In the case of craniotomy, a burr hole of about 5 mm is made at the junction between the transverse and the sigmoid sinus junction. Then, a craniotomy of about 2.5 cm in diameter is performed using a craniotome. The top of the bone window is near the horizontal inferior margin of the transverse sinus, and its lateral edge is on the posterior edge of the sigmoid sinus. Mastoid air cells are closed with bone wax. The dura is incised in a flap shape with its base located at the sigmoid sinus. The lower lateral cerebellum is gently lifted from the petrous bone, and the lateral cerebellomedullar cistern is opened gradually to release CSF. The cerebellopontine angle cistern and lateral cerebellomedullar cistern are dissected to expose the anatomical structures.

### New parameters to represent the position of the aorta relative to the spine for pedicle screw placement [^1144Gu5c]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Parameters of the position of the aorta in previous reports were determined for anterior surgery. This study evaluated the relative position of the aorta to the spine by new parameters, which could enhance the safety of pedicle screw placement. Three parameters were defined in a new Cartesian coordinate system. We selected an entry point of a left pedicle screw as the origin. The transverse plane was determined to include both the bases of the superior facet and to be parallel to the upper endplate of the vertebral body. A line connecting the entry points of both sides was defined as the X-axis. The angle formed by the Y-axis and a line connecting the origin and the center of the aorta was defined as the left pedicle-aorta angle. The length of a line connecting the origin and the aorta edge was defined as the left pedicle-aorta distance. Distance from the edge of the aorta to the X-axis was defined as the pedicular line-aorta distance. These parameters were measured preoperatively in 293 vertebral bodies of 24 patients with a right thoracic curve. We simulated the placement of the pedicle screw with variable length and with some direction error. We defined a warning pedicle as that when the aorta enters the expected area of the screw. Sensitivity analysis was performed to find the warning pedicle ratio in 12 scenarios. The left pedicle-aorta angle averaged 29.7 degrees at the thoracic spine and -16.3 degrees at the lumbar spine; the left pedicle-aorta distance averaged 23.7 and 55.2 mm; the pedicular line-aorta distance averaged 18.3 and 51.0 mm, respectively. The ratio of warning pedicles was consistently high at T4-5 and T10-12. When a left pedicle screw perforates an anterior/lateral wall of the vertebral body, the aorta may be at risk. These new parameters enable surgeons to intuitively understand the position of the aorta in surgical planning or in placement of a pedicle screw.

### Robotic heller myotomy and dor fundoplication: twelve steps [^111tE9zy]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

The appropriate size of the hernia is decided on based on the surgeon's judgment, but in general, it should be not tight around the esophagus with the gastroscope in the stomach, and not too loose to allow herniation.
12 Dor fundoplication (Video 10): using five 2 to 0 TiCron stitches the wrap is created.

First stitch: from the tip of the fundus to left edge of the myotomy to the left crus.

Second stitch: from the base of the fundus (at the angle of His) to the left edge of the myotomy.

Third stitch: after folding the fundus anteriorly on the esophagus, a stitch is taken between the fundus at the line of the divided short gastric vessels to the lateral edge of the right crus at "9 o'clock" on the hiatus. This bite can also incorporate the right lateral edge of the myotomy.

Fourth stitch: from the line of the divided short gastric on the fundus to the right edge of the myotomy to the right crus.

Fifth stitch: typically, fundus to edge of myotomy, but more inferiorly.

The sutured are arranged in this way to help splay the myotomy edges open to minimize the risk of esophageal outflow obstruction.
Our keys to a successful Dor fundoplication include: (1) appropriate closure of the crura; (2) recreation of the angle of His; (3) avoid twisting of the distal esophagus/GEJ/cardia; and (4) avoid acute angulation across the esophagus.

We prefer to do the Dor over an EGD to help prevent angulation and torsion and to allow for inspection after the creation of the fundoplication.

The gastroscope is taken out after checking the fundoplication and the integrity of the mucosa. Typically, the EGJ The robotic instruments are taken out under direct vision, the robot is undocked, and the incisions are closed.

The patients are kept nothing by mouth on the day of surgery, advanced to clear liquid diet on the following day, then discharged on the second postoperative day on full liquid diet for 2 weeks. The diet is advanced gradually afterwards.

### Assembly of planar chiral superlattices from achiral building blocks [^1175TkkU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The spontaneous assembly of chiral structures from building blocks that lack chirality is fundamentally important for colloidal chemistry and has implications for the formation of advanced optical materials. Here, we find that purified achiral gold tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticles assemble into two-dimensional superlattices that exhibit planar chirality under a balance of repulsive electrostatic and attractive van der Waals and depletion forces. A model accounting for these interactions shows that the growth of planar structures is kinetically preferred over similar three-dimensional products, explaining their selective formation. Exploration and mapping of different packing symmetries demonstrates that the hexagonal chiral phase forms exclusively because of geometric constraints imposed by the presence of constituent tetrahedra with sharp tips. A formation mechanism is proposed in which the chiral phase nucleates from within a related 2D achiral phase by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of tetrahedra about their central axis. These results lay the scientific foundation for the high-throughput assembly of planar chiral metamaterials.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Critical factors in achieving fine-scale functional MRI: removing sources of inadvertent spatial smoothing [^114k6jo3]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

4.4 Disadvantages of nearest‐neighbor interpolation

Although we demonstrated through simulations based on synthetic noise data that nearest‐neighbor interpolation may be advantageous since it induces the smallest spatial blur (Figures 2 and 3), we chose not to use nearest‐neighbor interpolation in our V2 stripe analysis, rather we opted to use trilinear interpolation. Our reasoning behind this decision to not use nearest‐neighbor interpolation is that it also causes displacement and local distortion artifacts, both in the context of volume transformations and surface projections.

Nearest‐neighbor interpolation applied to when transforming volumetric data is known to does not correctly account for subvoxel displacements (Grootoonk et al.) because it is a nonlinear interpolation — small displacements relative to the voxel grid may cause no changes in intensity after interpolation, and if the magnitude of displacement increases steadily there can be sudden jumps in intensity after interpolation.

Nearest‐neighbor interpolation applied to volume‐to‐surface projection when using coarse grid spacing on surface mesh relative to a dense volume grid can cause displacement artifacts (i.e. fine‐scale distortion) and missing voxels (Figure 4). This can lead to artifactual truncated appearance of the data projected onto the surface; this manifests as an aliased appearance of the activation pattern and artifactual edges, which may give misleading fine‐scale structure in the activation pattern. Nevertheless, we note that nearest‐neighbor surface interpolation can be beneficial provided that the surface mesh spacing is sufficiently fine relative to the volume resolution.

4.5 Other methods exist for representing voxel data on surface

Our results show that surface refinement can help decrease the number of missing fMRI voxels when projecting data onto cortical surfaces. However, our tests demonstrate that the number of unique voxels does not plateau until three iterations of refinement have been performed. If we were to require that all fMRI voxels intersecting the cortex are included in the projection, an even denser vertex mesh might be needed, however, each step of refinement dramatically increases the computational load of the analysis while providing diminishing returns. We note that the number and density of vertices are dependent upon the algorithm used to reconstruct the surface mesh, and in the method used by FreeSurfer these are a function of the voxel grid used in the anatomical data, which in our case was a 1‐mm MPRAGE. As higher‐resolution anatomical data, which have been shown to provide improved surface reconstruction accuracy, become more common, so will higher density surfaces, which will require less refinement.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^111ndbni]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Clinical course — hip morphology and osteoarthritis (OA) risk: Current evidence suggests that both hip dysplasia and cam morphology are associated with the development of hip OA. Prospective studies identified hips with a lateral center edge angle (LCEA) less than 25° as being 2.3 times more likely to develop OA compared to those hips with an LCEA greater than or equal to 25°. Prospective studies reported hips with alpha angle measurements greater than 60° were 2.5 times more likely to develop OA compared to hips with alpha angle measurements less than or equal to 60°. While an association between pincer morphology (LCEA > 39°) and the presence of OA was described in cross-sectional studies, prospective studies did not support an association, and inconsistent definitions and lack of clinical context support the need for further research.

### Content-based estimation of brain MRI tilt in three orthogonal directions [^111QceGZ]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Estimating the pitch angle: (a) relationship between the AC-PC line and line joining the Nasion (N) and Inion (I) point, (b) estimation of pitch angle (ω) with respect to the line joining the Nasion (N) and Inion (I), and (c) in anterior, Nasion (N) is the point that has a minimum distance from Centroid (C), and in posterior, Inion (I) is the point that has the maximum distance from the Centroid (C) (the Nasion and Inion point marked by visual inspection)

The pitch angle is the angle of rotation observed about X -direction. Evaluation of this angle considers the mid-sagittal slice that shows the midbrain structures (like medulla oblongata and pons) and corpus callosum with AC and PC. Dividing the total number of sagittal slices of 3D-volumetric brain MRI data by 2 can obtain a mid-sagittal slice. The histogram of MR images showed the bimodal distribution due to which mid-sagittal slice is subjected to Otsu thresholding to get the head contour. The head contour's centroid is computed based on the number of pixels (of value 1) within the head contours. There are three points in the head contour's anterior part with a minimum distance from the Centroid; they are Nasion, Philtrum, and labial Commissure. A percentage of pixels above and below the Centroid is obtained that encloses only Nasion. After several observations, we chose half of the section between the top of the contour and the Centroid, and from the Centroid to the half of the section between the Centroid and bottom of the contour. Suppose we choose the section beyond this limit; in that case, the section will include Philtrum and labial Commissure, which increases the ambiguity in choosing the correct Nasion point because Philtrum and labial Commissure also have a minimum distance from the Centroid. The range is considered based on the assumption that the Nasion point and Inion point lies within this range. Then, we computed Euclidean distance between the Centroid and the set of points located at the head contour's anterior boundary within this range. The Nasion (N) point is the one that has a minimum distance from Centroid (C) (as shown in Fig. 2 c). Compute Euclidean distance between the Centroid and the set of points located at the head contour's posterior boundary within this range. Anatomically, the Inion point is the crest present at the posterior part of the skull, so the Inion point is the one that has a maximum distance from the Centroid (C). Then, compute pitch angle (ω) by finding the angle made by the line joining the Nasion point and Inion point with horizontal (or Y -axis). The line joined the Nasion, and Inion varied by 15 mm ± 2.3 mm. The Nasion and Inion point identified by the proposed algorithm varied by 1 mm ± 0.5 mm and 3 mm ± 0.75 mm. Visual inspection of Nasion is easier than Inion because of the major depression felt between the eyes. To estimate the pitch angle using the proposed algorithm, one must ensure that MR volume should have a Nasion point. Figure 3 illustrates the pseudo-code for estimating the pitch angle.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^113krrR7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — imaging guidance highlights initial radiography, radiographic classifications, and anatomic measurements. These ACR Appropriateness Criteria state that hip and pelvic radiographs are recommended as the initial choice for imaging in those with acute or chronic hip pain, and findings on the hip and pelvic radiographs may lead to diagnosis such as radiographic OA or to additional ancillary imaging. The anteroposterior pelvic radiograph is most useful for assessing acetabular over- and undercoverage of the femoral head, associated with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The Tonnis Classification is commonly used and defines as follows: Grade 0 (no signs of OA); Grade 1 (Mild; increased sclerosis, slight narrowing of the joint space, no or slight loss of head sphericity); Grade 2 (Moderate; small cysts, moderate narrowing of the joint space, moderate loss of head sphericity); and Grade 3 (Severe; large cysts, severe narrowing or obliteration of the joint space, severe deformity of the head). Acetabular depth is commonly defined by the lateral center edge angle of Wiberg and is the angle measured between a vertical line from the center of the femoral head and a line from the lateral edge of the acetabulum; the angle for normal is between 25° and 39°, values less than 25° indicate lateral acetabular undercoverage, and values above 39° indicate lateral or excessive acetabular overcoverage. Specialized views, such as the false profile, frog lateral, elongated femoral neck lateral (Dunn) views, or cross-table lateral, allow for radiographic assessment measures of femoral head and neck deformities; radiographic indicators of pincer morphology associated with acetabular retroversion include the crossover and ischial spine signs, and cam morphology is identified on the lateral radiographic views and quantified by measuring the alpha angle and anterior offset distance.

### Transcarotid vascular access for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: is choosing the left side always right? [^1123mzPH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Tortuosity index

To assess the level of vessel tortuosity, we employed two parameters. The first parameter was the tortuosity index (TI), which is calculated as the percentage ratio of actual length of the arterial segment (determined from curvilinear reconstructions) divided by the shortest distance between the two points (as shown in Fig. 1, point A to point B). The TI has been previously used to assess arterial tortuosity in various conditions, including aortic diseases. In our study, the shortest distance between points A and B was measured using calipers on three-dimensional volume rendering reconstructions. A TI value of "1" indicates no tortuosity and as the value increases, the vessel is considered more tortuous. Inter-observer reproducibility was not tested, based on the results of a previous study.

Sum of angles metric

The second method used to evaluate vessel tortuosity was the sum of angles metric. This approach involved measuring the angles of concave curvatures in a three-dimensional manner for each vessel. For example, in Fig. 2, the relevant angles between each CCA and the aortic annulus were first assessed. Each angle was then measured, and angulation was categorized as severe (< 30°), moderate (30–60°) or mild (> 60°), based on a previously established classification. The measured angles for each side were summed, with a smaller sum of angles indicating a more tortuous pathway. In cases where one side had two angles and the other one had three angles, 180° were added to the first side to ensure comparability. It is important to note that the sum of angles metric may be subject to inter-observer variability and should be interpreted with caution.

Fig. 2
Measure of the sum of angles from the right and left CCAs to the center of the aortic annulus (respectively left and right panels). In both cases, three angles (respectively αR1, αR2, αR3 and αL1, αL2, αL3) were measured

Plaque burden

Plaque burden was determined by the presence of any arterial plaque on the vessels, irrespective of the number or type (calcified, mixed, or non-calcified) of the plaques. The assessment did not involve quantification of the stenotic effect of the plaque (> 50% stenosis), unless it was considered clinically relevant.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^117N79hR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Nasal anatomy definitions — Table 2 clarifies structures relevant to rhinoplasty, including the upper lateral cartilage, lower lateral cartilage, internal nasal valve, external nasal valve, nasal septum, and nasal turbinates. The upper lateral cartilage is the lateral cartilage piece of the nose, triangular in shape, meeting with the nasal bones superiorly and the lower lateral cartilages inferiorly and fusing with the septum in the midline. The lower lateral cartilage is a thin flexible plate of cartilage folded on itself and situated just below the upper lateral cartilage, making up the medial and lateral wall of the nostril. The internal nasal valve refers to the area bordered by the upper lateral cartilage laterally, the septum medially, the head of the inferior turbinate, and the floor of the nose, while the external nasal valve refers to the area bordered by the lateral limb of the lower lateral cartilage laterally, the medial limb of the lower lateral cartilage and the septum medially, and the floor of the nose. The nasal septum is the wall of cartilage and bone that runs down the middle of the nose dividing it into left and right nasal passages, and the nasal turbinates are long narrow curved shelves of bone covered in mucus membrane and protruding into the nasal passage.

### The ambiguity of names and landmarks in radiographs of the pediatric pelvis: variations and a historical perspective [^113dGDPN]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In the 1950s, Massie et al modified the measuring technique so that the horizontal line was instead aligned with the pelvis, similar to the line described by Hilgenreiner. Values of the CEA are often reported without pointing out whether Wiberg's original femoral head center-to-center or a pelvic-based reference line has been used. Without doubt, the latter is the accepted norm in contemporary research (Figures 5 and 6).

Figure 6
Diagram showing an adult pelvis. In this adult pelvis, the horizontal line is drawn from the base of the teardrops, although other reference points have been described. On the right hip (Dx), the traditional CEA, as modified by Massie, is illustrated with the black X line. In the modified version (sometimes referred to as Ogata' angle), the edge of the sourcil is used instead as shown by the red Y line. CEA = center-edge angle.

Lequesneelaborated on the CEA (using the term "VCE — vertical centre externe") and modified the method by pointing out that the lateral landmark should not be at the outer end of the ileum but instead at the lateral end of the sourcil ("Le point E est léxtrémité externe du toit et non le bord externe de l'íléon: il est marqué par la fin de la ligne condense du toit"). Later, Ogata et alcompared measuring the CEA using the lateral end of the sourcil versus the lateral bony end of the acetabulum. They found that using the end of the sourcil provided a more accurate assessment of the femoral head cover when comparing plain radiographs with CT scans, particularly in dysplastic hips and in younger children. CEA using the lateral end of the sourcil as a reference point has since sometimes been called "Ogata angle" but uses the same landmark as Lequesne.

Lequesne also proposed a method to assess the acetabular coverage in the sagittal plane as an adjunct to Wiberg's original measurement in the coronal plane. Using a false-profile radiographic view (Le faux profil), the anterior CEA or vertical centre antérieure has become an established method and is sometimes called "the Lequesneangle".

### Association between early sonographic findings and acetabular index at the age of 6 months: a prospective observational study [^116xNXm8]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In the Graf method, the alpha angle refers to the angle between the vertical cortex of the ilium (base line) and the bony acetabular roof line; the beta angle is formed by the base line and the triangular labral fibrocartilage line (Fig. 1). Graf type I was defined as an alpha angle ≥ 60°; type IIa and IIb were defined as an alpha angle between 50°and 59° in newborns younger or older than 3 months old, respectively; type IIc and type D were defined as an alpha angle between 43°and 49° with a beta angle greater or less than 77°, respectively; type III and IV were dislocated hips defined as an alpha angle < 43° with an absence or presence of inverted labrum, respectively. Graf type > I was defined as immature. The FHC ratio was measured as the length from the base line to the parallel line connected to the most medial femoral head divided by the length between the 2 lines parallel to the base line that connected to the most medial and lateral femoral head (Fig. 1). FHC < 50% was considered abnormal.

### Optimal blade pitch control for enhanced vertical-axis wind turbine performance [^115twMAo]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The optimal individuals improve their power coefficient by a factor 2.5 to 3.2 and reduce the pitching moment standard deviation by 60% to 77% (Fig. 3 a). Overall, both objectives can be achieved hand in hand and the remaining trade-off between increasing performance and reducing fluctuations is tied to subtle changes in the pitching kinematics.

The Pareto-optimal pitching kinematics all execute an outward pitching manoeuvre during the upwind phase, followed by inward pitching manoeuvre during the downwind phase (Fig. 3 b). The initial outward pitching manoeuvre serves to reduce the blade's effective angle of attack, delay the moment the critical static stall angle is exceeded, and reduce the maximum effective angle of attack (Fig. 3 c, d). The blade pitching kinematics that yield the highest power coefficients have a higher amplitude of the mean offset angle (Fig. 3 e) and have a higher contribution of the third order terms from the sine-series described by equation (2) (Fig. 3 f). The highest power coefficient kinematics with a large amplitude of A 3 also yield the lowest reduction in the pitching moment fluctuations. The variations for the amplitudes of all sine terms are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. These more complicated kinematics perform well in our controlled laboratory environment, but for general applications, we would recommend using the simpler kinematics that are likely to be more robust and further reduce the pitching moment standard deviation.

The inward pitching manoeuvre during the downwind phase serves to decrease the magnitude of the blade's effective angle of attack below the critical stall angle between t / T = 0.70 and t / T = 0.78 for all Pareto-optimal solutions (Fig. 3 c). The magnitude of the effective angle of attack of the non-actuated turbine blade remains above the critical limit during most of the downwind (∣ α eff ∣ > α ss from t / T = 0.52 to t / T = 0.90) which prevents the turbine from creating significant power during the downwind phase (Fig. 4). The earlier recovery in the Pareto-optimal blade pitching cases allows for a second region of substantial power production in the second half of the downwind phase (Fig. 4).

### Generation of spatiotemporal acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented orbital angular momentum [^112QmViA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Direct rotation of spatiotemporal (ST) vortices in three-dimensional (3D) space

While previous studies on acoustic OAM have primarily focused on longitudinal and transverse OAM, it is essential to recognize that acoustic OAM can exhibit arbitrary orientations. To alter the direction of the OAM, we can directly rotate the wave packet carrying transverse or longitudinal OAM in 3D space. Here, we take the example of rotating a wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM. Considering a 45-degree rotation around the-axis of the acoustic pressure field described in Eq. (1) and setting, the rotated wave packet is expressed as:

The wave packet carrying longitudinal OAM is rotated without altering its propagation direction along the-axis. The intrinsic OAM carried by the tilted wave packet can be calculated using Eqs. (3)–(5) as, indicating that the OAM direction also rotates 45 degrees around the-axis. The 3D iso-intensity profiles, derived from both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for the rotated wave packet, are illustrated in Fig. 3 a, b, including perspective, front, side, and top views. The direction of the OAM after rotation is indicated by orange arrows in Fig. 3a. From the three views, it is evident that there is a tunnel tilted at a 45-degree angle upwards relative to the-axis. This is because the singularity line is rotated from being aligned with the z-axis to a direction at a 45-degree angle to the z-axis. Figure 3 c, d presents the amplitude distributions in the, andcross-sections passing through the center of the wave packet, and Fig. 3 e, f illustrate the corresponding phase distributions, based on both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Due to the rotation of the wave packet, the previously circular intensity distribution on theplane is now rotated onto a plane with a normal vector of. The tilted annular intensity distribution obtained after rotation exhibits an elliptical intensity distribution on both theandcross-sections, while the diagonal line with zero intensity in thecross-section corresponds to the tilted tunnel passing through the center of the wave packet, as illustrated in Fig. 3 c, d. The phase distribution in thecross-section exhibits an edge phase dislocation, corresponding to the transverse OAM component in the-direction, while the phase distribution in thecross-section manifests a helical phase dislocation, corresponding to the longitudinal OAM component in the-direction, as shown in Fig. 3 e, f. Here, only an example of a wave packet rotating 45 degrees around the-axis is shown. More generally, by controlling the direction and angle of rotation of the wave packet, the orientation of OAM can be precisely manipulated in the 3D space.

### Spontaneous curvature in two-dimensional van der waals heterostructures [^113opKEa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We also investigate the effect of lattice orientation on the curvature of Gr/BN bilayer. Figure 6a, b depict the height displacement distribution of Gr and BN layers with a twist angle φ ~ 1.5°. The periodic length of the moiré superlattice is 79 Å, significantly smaller than that of the Gr/BN moiré superlattice with practically aligned crystallographic axes (φ = 0°). Consequently, the maximum height displacement of the twisted Gr/BN bilayer also decreased to 1.2 Å. Additionally, the distribution of stacking states in the twisted Gr/BN bilayer is consistent with that of the aligned Gr/BN heterostructure. At the lowest height in the twisted Gr/BN heterostructure, the stacking state is CB stacking, while at the highest and second-highest sites, AA and CB stacking are observed, respectively.

The out-of-plane topology of a the Gr layer and b the BN layer. The bond length distribution of c the Gr layer and d the BN layer. e The curvature of Gr and BN layers calculated according to the atomic positions along the white dashed line in (a) and (b), respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Figure 6c, d indicate the bond length distribution of Gr and BN layers in twisted Gr/BN bilayer. The bond length is stretched within the domain and compressed within the domain wall in the Gr layer. However, there is no sharp change in bond length across the domain wall in each moiré unit cell, making it difficult to identify the edge of the domain wall. The distinct difference in bond length distribution between the Gr/BN heterostructure with φ ~ 1.5° and φ ~ 0° was previously observed and recognized as the commensurate-incommensurate transition. Based on the explicit atomic arrangement from MD simulations, we found that the bond length is highly anisotropic within the twisted Gr/BN moiré superlattice and exhibits in-plane rotation. Local bond extension and suppression co-exist in the transition region where the stacking states changes from AA to CN stacking.

### Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for quantification of pulmonary edema in acute lung injury [^1167cUTo]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Data processing of EIT data and calculation of lung water ratio EIT

Each EIT dataset was processed offline. The EIT-based parameter lung water ratio EIT was calculated from data in the three defined body positions. First, the differences in tidal ventilation (TV) between the left and the right lungs were calculated. For this purpose, the sum of the TV signals of all pixels representing the left and right hemithorax were computed separately and filtered using a Butterworth low-pass filter (cutoff frequency 2 Hz, filter order 8) to remove higher-frequency noise and cardiac activity. TV within the left and right hemithorax was expressed as the percentage of the total TV of both lungs. Two coefficients were computed by taking the root mean square value of the cyclic components of the two aforementioned V T signals. These coefficients were then labeled TV L and TV R and represented the tidal ventilation within the left and right lungs, respectively (Fig. 1). From these two coefficients, an imbalance coefficient (IM L–R) was calculated that expressed the ratio of ventilation between the left and right lungs:

Fig. 1
Process for extracting the tidal ventilation of the left lung and the tidal ventilation of the right lung (TV L and TV R, respectively) from sets of electrical impedance tomographic images. RMS root mean square

This parameter was normalized between +1 (only the left lung is ventilated; TV R = 0) and −1 (only the right lung is ventilated; TV L = 0). This imbalance coefficient (IM L–R) was calculated for each pig in each position at baseline and after acute lung injury.

For calculation of lung water ratio EIT, a set of data collected at the three different lateral rotation angles during baseline and acute lung injury was used to calculate a characteristic slope (Fig. 2). The parameter lung water ratio EIT is the slope of the trend line (least square regression, first order) assuming that the distance on the x -axis between two successive positions (left tilt, horizontal and right tilt) is 1.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^112pSeFT]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^116ZYG3W]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### Two-dimensional ferroelasticity in van der waals β'-InSe [^112Tf3Je]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Besides the wrinkled surface across 120° DWs, the shear strain in 3R β' -In 2 Se 3 also leads to inclined 60° DWs as required by the mechanical compatibility, for coherent DWs (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2). Such inclined 60° DWs are indeed observed via both polarized-light microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). As shown in Fig. 7b, across a step edge with the height ~270 nm, all the 60° DWs exhibit a horizontal shift of ~480 nm, reflecting their inclined nature. We note that the observed domain contrast in lateral PFM phase image (Fig. 7b) is attributed to the second-order electrostrictive effect, and thus the phase difference between domains is less than 180° (see Supplementary Note 5).

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^1172Tgi9]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^111RRQix]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Research and clinical application of three-dimensional location of amygdaloid body [^111Genoa]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Accurately representing the spatial location of the amygdaloid body can lay an anatomical basis for the neurosurgery operation for amputation of the amygdaloid body through lateral fissure approach. As we know, there are a number of nerve nucleuses and essential structures locating around amygdaloid body in our brain, especially optic tract. However, only few research had been done to protect these tissues or nerve nucleuses. Thus, we reconstructed the three-dimensional images of the amygdaloid body of the human brain and established a coordinate system. The morphological parameters of the amygdaloid body and the three-dimensional coordinate data were measured. The spherical coordinates (R, θ, ϕ) were constructed by calculating the azimuth angle, elevation angle, and the distance from the coordinates origin to each amygdaloid body centroid. Sixty people brain MRI images without any visible organic disease were used in our research to investigate the average level of related parameters. The authors selected a proper coordinate origin and measured the value of anteroposterior diameter, right-and-left diameter, vertical diameter of the amygdaloid body, and the distance from the optic tract to amygdaloid body. The authors also measured the three-dimensional coordinate data of each centroid of the amygdaloid body in order to provide anatomical suggestion for surgery. The authors confirmed the nearest point from the foremost edge of the brain ventricle temporal horn to the lateral fissure, then viewed it as the coordinate origin. By means of coordinate translation, the authors got various morphological parameters and the coordinate values of each centroid of the amygdaloid body. Spherical coordinates were calculated from the three-dimensional coordinate values. The distances between the different layers of the amygdaloid body and the optic tract were also measured. The reconstruction of the three-dimensional coordinates of amygdaloid body is part of the digital engineering of the human body. The measurement of the parameters provides an important theoretical basis for the clinical amygdaloid body destruction surgery. Finally, the authors get conclusions as follows. There are no significant differences in the measured values of r1, r2, and r3 between the upper and lower diameters, the left and right diameters, the anteroposterior diameter of the amygdaloid body. The measured values of men and women are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Spherical coordinates (R, θ, ϕ) calculated from the three-dimensional coordinate values and values from different sexes of the amygdaloid body are not statistically significant, either (P > 0.05). The distance between the different levels of the amygdaloid body and the optic tract (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, and h7) are not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

### The emergence of three-dimensional chiral domain walls in polar vortices [^116vveBq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

From a theoretical perspective, there are three symmetry-breaking operations for the formation of domain walls, (1) Change in the lateral polarization direction, (2) Change in axial polarization direction, and (3) Change in the net lateral polarization due to the vortex core shifting away from the center. If we consider all three factors, then we expect to have six types of domain walls as shown in Fig. 4. The first pair of chiral domain walls, α / α ′, results from a combination of the factors 1 and 3. The second chiral domain wall pair, β / β ′, results from a combination of the factors 2 and 3. The third achiral domain wall pair results from all the three factors. Unfortunately, it is challenging to measure the quantitative net lateral component in the vortices due to the very low sensitivity of electron scattering to sample changes along the beam direction. Due to this, α / α ′, β / β ′, and γ / γ ′ are degenerate in this 4D-STEM experiment and thus we observe only three types of domain walls. This has been consistent in multiple such 4D STEM images as observed in Figs. S6 – S7. Future studies, such as depth sectioning or sample tilting experiments, may be able to probe this variation.

Types of chiral domain walls.

a Four possible combinations of alternating clockwise/counterclockwise vortices are displaced, Top and bottom cartoons differ by the direction of the axial component of the polarization (red dot and blue cross). Left and right cartons differ by the curl of the polarization. The possible domain walls between these configurations are marked as α / α ′, β / β ′, and γ / γ ′. α / α ′ and β / β ′ domain walls change the chirality at the domain wall. γ / γ ′ domains preserve the chirality. b – d Three-dimensional representation of three types of chiral domain walls observed by 4D-STEM measurements.

The last 3 decades have seen much progress in the treatment and outcome of patients with ALL. Unfortunately, the success that has been achieved in children with ALL has not yet been translated into adult patients. Insight into the biologic and molecular abnormalities in ALL may, however, provide the necessary clues that allow a clearer understanding of the crucial differences in the behavior of ALL in different groups of patients. As the molecular basis of the disease is deciphered, new targets are discovered that may prove useful for therapeutic interventions in the future.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^111vKSNn]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.
