## Question

Is it safe to take glyburide, metformin, and Rybelsus concurrently?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to take glyburide, metformin, and Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) together, including evidence, risks, dosing, interactions, and monitoring considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanisms of each agent. Then, I should verify the clinical trial and labeling evidence for adding oral semaglutide to metformin with or without a sulfonylurea. Next, I need to check hypoglycemia risk and dose adjustment of the sulfonylurea, review gastrointestinal tolerability, assess renal function constraints, and confirm other key safety warnings. After that, I should examine drug interaction and administration timing issues, outline practical dosing and titration, and define monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize an overall safety assessment and a clinically actionable recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the drug classes and mechanisms to anchor the risk-benefit framing. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue that increases pancreatic beta-cell insulin release and can cause hypoglycemia and weight gain, metformin is a biguanide that reduces hepatic glucose output and improves insulin sensitivity with minimal intrinsic hypoglycemia risk, and oral semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon, delays gastric emptying, and promotes weight loss; together, this regimen pairs two insulin-augmenting agents (glyburide and semaglutide) with metformin, which is mechanistically complementary but increases the potential for hypoglycemia from the secretagogue when a GLP-1 RA is added [^113jUu5p] [^116493Hw] [^111PJmoe] [^1145C2Rh] [^111EGdWy] [^114WZ4oy].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for using Rybelsus with metformin and a sulfonylurea, and I need to ensure that glyburide, specifically, is not excluded. The PIONEER 3 randomized trial evaluated oral semaglutide added to metformin with or without a sulfonylurea and demonstrated superior HbA1c and weight effects versus sitagliptin, with acceptable safety under monitoring; this reflects real-world backgrounds that included glyburide, and the FDA label summarizes these data, confirming that oral semaglutide was studied on top of metformin alone or metformin plus sulfonylurea, while PIONEER 4 addressed metformin ± SGLT2 inhibitor backgrounds, supporting efficacy across common regimens; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a "glyburide-only" subgroup — no trial isolates glyburide versus other sulfonylureas, but the class background supports the triple regimen in principle [^114Ycy6s] [^1124Ua7w] [^113FixFF] [^1156eKT5] [^1115f89a].

> Now, I will examine hypoglycemia risk and the need to adjust the sulfonylurea because that is the critical safety pressure point. Wait, let me verify the labeling language: GLP-1 RAs have low hypoglycemia risk by themselves due to glucose-dependent action, but the semaglutide label explicitly warns to use caution and consider reducing insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas when coadministered; in practice, reducing glyburide by roughly 50% at oral semaglutide initiation is a reasonable starting approach, with further down-titration guided by self-monitoring of blood glucose to avert hypoglycemia, and this is consistent with general glyburide/metformin labeling emphasizing careful titration to the minimum effective dose with close glucose monitoring during changes [^111EGdWy] [^115SqxRA] [^111PJmoe] [^113qCZic].

> I need to check gastrointestinal tolerability because both metformin and GLP-1 RAs contribute to GI adverse events that can affect adherence. Metformin commonly causes diarrhea, and oral semaglutide has GI disorders as the most frequent adverse events, with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea increasing especially during dose escalation; let me consider mitigation — slow and stepwise titration of semaglutide from 3 mg to 7 mg to 14 mg with allowances for slower up-titration or temporary dose reduction improves tolerability, and counseling patients about expected transient GI effects helps maintain adherence while preventing dehydration-related complications [^112aRVCf] [^114FGRFv] [^111EGdWy] [^111Yi84Z] [^112PdKXe].

> Hold on, I should verify renal function constraints and reconcile them across all three agents. I almost thought semaglutide was contraindicated in chronic kidney disease — wait, that's not correct; the semaglutide label shows no clinically significant PK differences in renal impairment, though severe GI reactions can precipitate acute kidney injury and warrant renal monitoring, whereas metformin is contraindicated at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and should not be initiated at eGFR 30–45, and glyburide requires caution in renal impairment due to prolonged hypoglycemia risk; accordingly, this triple therapy should be avoided if eGFR is less than 30, used with great caution and close monitoring if eGFR is 30–45, and more comfortably considered when eGFR is at least 45 [^112mBrPP] [^111EGdWy] [^115EQ2nd] [^114Gsh44] [^113qCZic].

> Next, I should review other serious safety warnings to ensure no overlooked contraindication. Semaglutide carries pancreatitis warnings and a boxed C-cell tumor warning with contraindication in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2, sulfonylureas as a class have lingering cardiovascular mortality concerns dating back to tolbutamide, and metformin carries lactic acidosis warnings, particularly in the setting of renal or hepatic dysfunction, hypoxia, or alcohol excess; I need to ensure these are screened and counseled before triple therapy is initiated [^111EGdWy] [^115zpJzQ] [^1165KTuv] [^113qCZic].

> I will now examine drug interaction and administration timing because Rybelsus' absorption nuances can create real-world pitfalls. Oral semaglutide delays gastric emptying and can alter absorption of concomitant oral medications, with a notable levothyroxine exposure increase in formal studies; administration must be first thing in the morning with no more than 120 mL water, then wait at least 30 minutes before any food, drink, or other oral medications, which means glyburide/metformin doses should come after this interval; hmm, wait a minute, I started to think 60 minutes was required — let me double-check — data show longer post-dose fasting improves exposure, but the labeled minimum interval is 30 minutes, and that is the pragmatic instruction to follow while acknowledging that some clinicians may extend the interval if feasible [^112mBrPP] [^116rRQ4S] [^111Yi84Z] [^113ARm81].

> Let me outline dosing and titration to operationalize this safely. For glyburide/metformin, start low, give with meals, and titrate to effect while avoiding hypoglycemia, not exceeding 20 mg/2000 mg per day in divided doses; for Rybelsus, use 3 mg daily for 30 days, then 7 mg daily, with optional escalation to 14 mg if additional glycemic control is needed, keeping the strict fasting administration rules; hold on, I should confirm maximums and meal timing — the combination product labeling supports meal-associated dosing for glyburide/metformin to reduce GI upset, while semaglutide must be on an empty stomach separate from other meds, which dictates morning workflow and later breakfast dosing of the sulfonylurea/metformin [^115XC1pV] [^111PJmoe] [^111Yi84Z] [^116rRQ4S].

> I should double-check monitoring requirements to mitigate foreseeable risks during initiation and titration. Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is needed during semaglutide up-titration and after sulfonylurea dose reductions, HbA1c should be assessed about every three months to gauge efficacy, renal function should be checked at baseline and periodically according to risk, patients should be educated to recognize and treat hypoglycemia, and they should be counseled to report persistent severe abdominal pain suggesting pancreatitis, neck mass or hoarseness suggestive of MTC in at-risk individuals, and significant or persistent GI intolerance; monitoring for metformin-associated vitamin B12 deficiency over time is also prudent [^111PJmoe] [^113qCZic] [^111EGdWy] [^115zpJzQ] [^112aRVCf].

> Let me consider cardiometabolic context so I neither overstate nor understate benefits. Oral semaglutide reduces HbA1c and weight and improves cardiometabolic risk biomarkers, and while there is supportive CV outcome evidence for subcutaneous semaglutide, dedicated CV outcomes data for the oral formulation remain limited; therefore, any CV benefit statements for oral semaglutide should be cautious and framed around risk factor improvements rather than hard outcomes at this time [^114WZ4oy] [^1156eKT5].

> But wait, what if the patient has borderline renal function, prior pancreatitis, or a thyroid cancer family history; these would change the calculus. In eGFR less than 30, metformin is contraindicated and the triple regimen is off the table; a prior history of pancreatitis or a personal/family history of MTC/MEN2 would steer me away from semaglutide; if hypoglycemia remains problematic despite reducing or discontinuing glyburide, the sulfonylurea should be re-evaluated in favor of alternatives with lower hypoglycemia risk, acknowledging that the semaglutide component still offers glycemic and weight benefits independent of the sulfonylurea [^115EQ2nd] [^111EGdWy] [^1165KTuv] [^113qCZic].

> Synthesizing an overall safety assessment, I need to ensure patient selection aligns with the evidence and labeling. Concurrent use of glyburide, metformin, and oral semaglutide is evidence-based and clinically reasonable on metformin backgrounds with or without a sulfonylurea, provided I preempt hypoglycemia with a sulfonylurea dose reduction, manage GI effects with gradual semaglutide titration, respect renal thresholds driven largely by metformin, and exclude patients with GLP-1 RA contraindications such as MTC/MEN2; in appropriate patients, this approach can improve glycemic control and weight while maintaining safety under close monitoring [^114Ycy6s] [^1124Ua7w] [^112aRVCf] [^111EGdWy] [^1165KTuv].

> In practical terms, I should confirm eGFR is at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m² before initiating or intensifying metformin-containing therapy, reduce the glyburide dose by about half when starting Rybelsus and adjust based on self-monitored glucose, instruct the patient to take Rybelsus first thing in the morning with up to 120 mL water and wait at least 30 minutes before food or other medications, and schedule follow-up for glucose logs, symptoms, and labs within 4–8 weeks to titrate therapy and address adverse effects promptly [^114Gsh44] [^111PJmoe] [^111Yi84Z] [^116rRQ4S].

> Final recommendation, keeping all the above verified: proceed with the triple regimen in a patient without GLP-1 RA contraindications and with eGFR at least 45, proactively down-titrate glyburide to curb hypoglycemia, counsel on GI effects and exact Rybelsus administration, monitor closely for renal function, hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, and B12 status, and be prepared to further reduce or discontinue the sulfonylurea if hypoglycemia or GI intolerance persists, recognizing that the combination is supported by PIONEER data and current labeling when implemented with these safeguards [^114Ycy6s] [^1124Ua7w] [^111EGdWy] [^113qCZic] [^112aRVCf].

---

Yes, glyburide/metformin and Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) can be used together for type 2 diabetes, but **hypoglycemia risk increases** due to glyburide. Monitor glucose closely and **consider reducing the glyburide dose** [^113qCZic] [^111EGdWy]. Rybelsus should be taken first thing in the morning with ≤ 120 mL water [^116rRQ4S], then **wait at least 30 minutes** before food or other medications [^111Yi84Z]; take glyburide/metformin with meals to reduce GI effects and hypoglycemia risk [^111PJmoe]. Monitor for hypoglycemia, GI effects, and rare pancreatitis [^111EGdWy], adjust doses as needed and avoid in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115EQ2nd] or a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^1165KTuv].

## Pharmacological considerations

### Glyburide/metformin combination

The combination pairs glyburide, a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion and **increases hypoglycemia risk**, especially when used with other glucose-lowering agents [^113qCZic], with metformin, a biguanide that reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity with low hypoglycemia risk when used alone [^111PJmoe]. Together, these agents provide complementary mechanisms for improved glycemic control, but the hypoglycemia risk is higher because of glyburide [^113jUu5p].

---

### Rybelsus (oral semaglutide)

Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion [^1145C2Rh], decreases glucagon, delays gastric emptying, and promotes weight loss [^114YQ4nW]. As monotherapy, it has a low hypoglycemia risk, but the **risk is higher when combined with sulfonylureas or insulin** [^111EGdWy].

---

## Clinical evidence for combination therapy

Clinical trials and real-world data **support using Rybelsus with metformin and/or sulfonylureas**, demonstrating improved glycemic control and weight loss, but **hypoglycemia occurs more often when a sulfonylurea is included** [^1124Ua7w] [^1156eKT5] [^111EGdWy]. In the PIONEER 3 trial, adding oral semaglutide to metformin ± sulfonylurea improved HbA1c and weight, with more hypoglycemia when a sulfonylurea was included [^114Ycy6s]. A SUSTAIN subgroup analysis similarly found HbA1c and weight reductions regardless of a metformin or metformin+sulfonylurea background, but hypoglycemia was more frequent with sulfonylureas.

---

## Potential benefits of combination therapy

- **Improved glycemic control**: Complementary mechanisms can achieve better HbA1c reduction than monotherapy [^114Ycy6s].

- **Weight management**: Semaglutide-associated weight loss may offset glyburide-related weight gain [^114YQ4nW].

- **Cardiometabolic benefits**: Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors, potentially benefiting high-risk patients [^116Sih32] [^114WZ4oy].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hypoglycemia**: Increased risk due to glyburide; monitor closely and consider dose reduction [^113qCZic].

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common with semaglutide and metformin [^111EGdWy] [^112aRVCf].

- **Pancreatitis**: Rare but serious; discontinue semaglutide if suspected [^111EGdWy].

- **Renal impairment**: Use caution with metformin and semaglutide in renal impairment; monitor renal function [^113qCZic] [^112mBrPP] [^111EGdWy].

## Recommended dosing and administration guidelines

| **Medication** | **Recommended dosing** | **Administration guidelines** |
|-|-|-|
| Glyburide/metformin | - Start: 1.25/250 mg PO q12–24h <br/> - Maintenance: 1.25–10/250–1,000 mg PO q12–24h <br/> - Max: 20/2,000 mg/day [^115XC1pV] | - Take with meals to reduce GI side effects and hypoglycemia risk [^111PJmoe] [^113qCZic] |
| Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) | - Start: 3 mg once daily for 30 days <br/> - Then 7 mg once daily <br/> - May increase to 14 mg once daily if needed [^111Yi84Z] [^113FixFF] | - Take first thing in the morning with ≤ 120 mL water [^116rRQ4S] <br/> - Wait ≥ 30 minutes before food, drink, or other medications [^111Yi84Z] |

## Monitoring and patient education

Regularly monitor **glucose and HbA1c** to assess efficacy and detect hypoglycemia [^114Ycy6s]. Educate patients to recognize and manage hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal adverse effects, and symptoms of pancreatitis [^111EGdWy]. Titrate doses based on response and tolerability, reducing glyburide if hypoglycemia occurs.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, metabolic acidosis, and a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^115EQ2nd] [^113qCZic] [^1165KTuv]. Use caution in renal or hepatic impairment, older adults, and patients at risk for hypoglycemia or pancreatitis [^112mBrPP] [^113qCZic] [^111EGdWy].

---

## Clinical scenarios for combination therapy

- **Inadequate glycemic control**: Consider when metformin and glyburide alone do not achieve targets [^114Ycy6s].

- **Obesity or weight management**: Useful when weight loss is desired [^114YQ4nW].

- **Cardiometabolic risk**: Consider in patients with high cardiovascular risk or multiple comorbidities [^116Sih32].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy may not be appropriate

Avoid **combination therapy** in patients with frequent or severe hypoglycemia, those with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), or individuals with a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer. In these cases, safety concerns outweigh potential glycemic benefits [^113qCZic] [^115EQ2nd] [^111EGdWy].

---

Glyburide/metformin and Rybelsus **can be combined** for type 2 diabetes, but monitor for hypoglycemia and GI effects, and adjust doses as needed [^114Ycy6s]. This combination can improve glycemic control and support weight loss, but requires careful monitoring and patient education [^113FixFF].

### Glucovance [^111PJmoe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Dosage of Glucovance must be individualized based on both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin. Glucovance should be given with meals and initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glyburide), reduce gastrointestinal side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate blood glucose control for the individual patient.

With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Glucovance and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to Glucovance therapy in patients taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of glyburide / metformin PO (also known as Glucovance):

- **Cardiovascular mortality**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the risk of increased cardiovascular mortality observed with tolbutamide may also apply to other sulfonylureas.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients at risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients, those on concomitant hypoglycemic medications or alcohol, and patients with renal, hepatic, adrenal, or pituitary impairment, malnutrition, calorie deficit, or after severe or prolonged exercise.

- **Decreased serum glyburide levels**: Use caution in patients taking colesevelam. Advise taking glyburide/metformin at least 4 hours before colesevelam.

- **Decreased serum vitamin B12**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metformin has been associated with an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Assess hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B12 every 2–3 years.

- **Lactic acidosis**: Use extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate), age ≥ 65 years, undergoing a radiological evaluation with contrast, surgery, and other procedures, hypoxic states (such as acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Assess eGFR before initiating metformin and monitor annually or more frequently in patients at risk of renal impairment.

Patients will be assigned to two groups, with one receiving the active agent and the other receiving a placebo. The active substance will be the oral GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide (Rybelsus 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg tablets; Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvaerd, Denmark). The drug must be taken on an empty stomach in the morning after at least an 8-hour fasting period. After the oral semaglutide tablet is ingested, subjects must wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking other oral medications. The oral semaglutide tablet must be taken with no more than a half glass of water (120 ml), must be swallowed whole, and cannot be split, crushed, or chewed.

The starting dose of oral semaglutide will be 3 mg; after 30 days, a dose escalation to 7 mg is anticipated, with a further escalation to 14 mg after another 30 days, which is expected to be the maintenance dose. A dose escalation regimen is needed to avoid the development of potential side effects. Dose escalation will be encouraged by notifying the patient by phone, with the call made one day prior to the day on which the new dose starts. If treatment with oral semaglutide is associated with unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects (moderate to severe), dose reduction or extension of dose escalation intervals will be allowed as judged by the unblinded nurse involved in the randomization process.

The placebo and semaglutide tablets will be provided in identical cases, will be identically shaped, and will be packaged to…

### Clinical features, cardiovascular risk profile, and therapeutic trajectories of patients with type 2 diabetes candidate for oral semaglutide therapy in the Italian specialist care [^114WZ4oy]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first orally delivered, peptidic hormone-based therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It utilizes advanced pharmaceutical technology to ensure its absorption and effectiveness when taken orally. Semaglutide is combined with SNAC (sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate) to protect the peptide from enzymatic degradation in the stomach, thereby increasing permeability and absorption. Compared to injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), it has the advantage of greater patient acceptability.

Based on results from the PIONEER trial program, oral semaglutide is the most effective drug for controlling glycemia and body weight among available oral medications for T2D. Additionally, oral semaglutide has demonstrated the ability to improve cardiovascular risk biomarkers, including blood pressure, lipids, abdominal adiposity, and inflammation. These characteristics make oral semaglutide an ideal option for the early treatment of patients with T2D following failure of metformin monotherapy, or in the presence of contraindications or intolerance to metformin.

Treatment of patients with T2D using oral semaglutide results in an improvement of cardiovascular risk factors. Although there is still no evidence that oral semaglutide improves cardiovascular outcomes for T2D, the same active compound, when administered subcutaneously in the SUSTAIN-6 trial, reduced the rate of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE) compared to placebo. In the pre-marketing PIONEER-6 trial, a similarly low HR for 3P-MACE was observed for oral semaglutide.

Very common adverse reactions (over 10%) associated with the use of glyburide/metformin PO (also known as Glucovance) include decreased blood glucose and diarrhea.

### Glyburide [^113jUu5p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Patients should be retitrated when transferred from glyburide (micronized) tablets or other oral hypoglycemic agents (see precautions).

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with glyburide tablets. In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient. This helps to detect primary failure, which is the inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and to detect secondary failure, which is the loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be valuable in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.

Short-term administration of glyburide tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.

### Rybelsus [^116rRQ4S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effect of volume and timing of water consumption was studied with single 10 mg doses of oral semaglutide (formulation R1) administered with 50 mL or 240 mL of water after an 8-hour overnight fast and a continued fast of 4 hours post-dose in healthy subjects. Semaglutide absorption (i.e. area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentrations (Cmax)) was higher following dosing with 50 mL water compared to that with 240 mL water.

For 10 days, healthy subjects received 10 mg of oral semaglutide (formulation R1) once daily with 50 mL or 120 mL of water under fasting conditions with post-dose fasting periods of 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. In this study, semaglutide absorption (i.e. AUC and Cmax) was higher following a longer post-dose fasting period. There were no clinically significant differences in semaglutide absorption with administration of 50 mL or 120 mL of water.

- **Distribution**: Semaglutide's absolute volume of distribution is approximately 8 L in patients with type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is > 99% bound to plasma albumin.

- **Elimination**: Semaglutide's elimination half-life is approximately one week with an absolute clearance of approximately 0.04 L/hour in patients with type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is present in the circulation for about five weeks after the last Rybelsus dose.

### Rybelsus [^115zpJzQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in mice and rats after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether Rybelsus causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as the human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period. The data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

Rybelsus is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with the use of Rybelsus and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors, such as a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, or persistent hoarseness.

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Rybelsus. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC, and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L.

### Oral semaglutide versus subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes (PIONEER 4): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3a trial [^1156eKT5]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight, but are currently only approved for use as subcutaneous injections. Oral semaglutide, a novel GLP-1 agonist, was compared with subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3a trial, we recruited patients with type 2 diabetes from 100 sites in 12 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with HbA1c of 7.0–9.5% (53–80.3 mmol/mol), on a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg or maximum tolerated) with or without a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) with an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and country of origin, to once-daily oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg), once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (dose escalated to 1.8 mg), or placebo for 52 weeks. Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of study drug discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (assumed all participants were on study drug without rescue medication) in all participants who were randomly assigned. The treatment policy estimand was the primary estimand. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and non-inferiority [margin: 0.4%] and superiority vs subcutaneous liraglutide), and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^114YQ4nW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacological options. The efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for weight loss in adults with obesity has not been confirmed.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind trial, 1961 adults with a body-mass index of 30 or greater (≥ 27 in persons with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) without diabetes were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achieving at least 5% weight reduction. The primary estimand evaluated the effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or the use of rescue interventions.

- **Results**: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group, compared with -2.4% in the placebo group, resulting in an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -13.4 to -11.5; P < 0.001). A greater proportion of participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).

### Rybelsus [^112mBrPP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain.

Excretion: The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and feces. Approximately 3% of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide.

- **Specific populations**: No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (≥ 18 years old), sex, race (White, Asian, or Black or African American), ethnicity, body weight (40 to 188 kg), upper GI disease (i.e. chronic gastritis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease), hepatic impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe based on the Child-Pugh system), and renal impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe, end-stage renal disease).

- **Drug interaction studies**:
	- **Clinical studies and model-informed approaches**: The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. Trials were conducted to study the potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of oral drugs taken with semaglutide administered orally at steady-state exposure.
	- **Levothyroxine**: Total thyroxine (i.e. adjusted for endogenous levels) AUC was increased by 33% following administration of a single dose of levothyroxine 600 mcg concomitantly administered with oral semaglutide. Maximum exposure (Cmax) was unchanged.
	- **Other drugs**: No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with omep.

### Rybelsus [^1145C2Rh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacodynamic evaluations described below were conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received once-weekly subcutaneous injections of either placebo or semaglutide over 12 weeks (semaglutide-treated patients were started on lower dosages and then titrated up to 1 mg once weekly). Rybelsus is not approved for subcutaneous use.

- **Fasting and postprandial glucose**: Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with a 1 mg semaglutide injection resulted in an absolute change from baseline and a relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration.

- **Insulin secretion**: Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with semaglutide compared with those given a placebo.

- **Glucagon secretion**: Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations.

- **Glucose-dependent insulin and glucagon secretion**: Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter-regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Gastric emptying**: Semaglutide causes a delay in early postprandial gastric emptying.

### Effect of additional oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin on glycated hemoglobin in adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin alone or with sulfonylurea: The PIONEER 3 randomized clinical trial [^114Ycy6s]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy.

- **Objective**: To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg, added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight.

- **Results**: Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n = 879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed.

### Oral semaglutide: Dosage in special situations [^113ARm81]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Ramadan fasting is characterized by month-long fasting from dawn to dusk, during which faithful believers abstain from food and water. Oral semaglutide can be taken 30–60 minutes before the suhur (early morning) meal, but this may be inconvenient for many. Another option is to take the drug before the iftar (evening) meal, but this will extend the fasting period by a half hour to one hour, which may not be welcome.

An alternative is to take oral semaglutide half an hour before midnight snacks, which can be consumed before or after Tarawih prayers. Consuming the semaglutide tablet with up to half a glass of water, performing the prayer, and then taking a small snack may provide an effortless way of taking the drug without intruding into one's lifestyle. It is advisable to always maintain a minimum of six hours of fasting before taking oral semaglutide to achieve the desired bioavailability.

- **Key dosing instructions**:
	- The drug should be taken with minimal water not exceeding 120 mL or 4 oz.
	- The patient should wait 30 minutes after taking the drug before consuming any food, drink, or medication.
	- Although patients should wait 30 minutes before consuming food, they should ideally eat a snack or meal within 30–60 minutes after taking the drug.
	- It is recommended that tablet semaglutide remain in the blister pack until consumption and not be placed in a pill box.
	- Co-administration of oral semaglutide may have a small impact on certain drugs such as metformin, furosemide, rosuvastatin, and thyroxine, and their effects should be monitored.

### A 26-week randomized controlled trial of semaglutide once daily versus liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on diet and exercise with or without metformin [^114FGRFv]. Diabetes Care (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily semaglutide in comparison to once-daily liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Research design and methods**: This 26-week, multicenter, double-blind trial involved patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c levels ranging from 7.0% to 10.0% (53–86 mmol/mol) and treated with diet and exercise, with or without metformin. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily semaglutide, liraglutide, or placebo in one of four volume-matched doses (semaglutide 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg and liraglutide 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg, with both compared within each volume-matched dose group). The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26.

- **Results**: In total, 705 randomized patients were exposed to trial products. At week 26, a dose-dependent change in HbA1c was observed with semaglutide from -1.1% (0.05 mg) to -1.9% (0.3 mg) and with liraglutide from -0.5% (0.3 mg) to -1.3% (1.8 mg), all P < 0.001 in favor of volume-matched semaglutide dose. The change with pooled placebo was -0.02% (P < 0.0001 vs. semaglutide). Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the most common adverse events (AEs) with semaglutide and liraglutide, occurring in 32.8–54.0% and 21.9–41.5% of patients, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily semaglutide at doses up to 0.3 mg/day resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c compared with liraglutide or placebo but with a higher frequency of GI AEs.

### Long-term cost-effectiveness analyses of empagliflozin versus oral semaglutide, in addition to metformin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the UK [^113VpCfV]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend treatment with a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with progression on metformin. In the randomized, controlled Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) 2 trial, the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin was compared with the GLP-1 receptor agonist oral semaglutide, in addition to metformin. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin 25 mg versus oral semaglutide 14 mg, in addition to metformin, for T2DM patients in the UK.

- **Methods**: Analyses were conducted from the UK healthcare payer perspective, using the IQVIA Core Diabetes model, with a time horizon of 50 years. Patients received either empagliflozin or oral semaglutide, in addition to metformin, until HbA1c threshold of 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) was exceeded, following which treatment intensification with insulin glargine in addition to empagliflozin or oral semaglutide plus metformin was assumed. Baseline cohort characteristics and 52-week treatment effects were derived from the PIONEER 2 trial. Treatment effects of empagliflozin and GLP-1 receptor agonists on hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) were based on the Empagliflozin Comparative Effectiveness and Safety (EMPRISE) real-world study. Utilities, treatment costs, and costs of diabetes-related complications were obtained from published sources.

- **Results**: Direct costs for empagliflozin plus metformin were considerably lo

### Glyburide [^112NJ2kF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

The usual maintenance dose of glyburide is typically between 1.25 to 20 mg daily. This can be administered either as a single dose or in divided doses. Dosage increases should occur in increments of no more than 2.5 mg at weekly intervals based on the patient's blood glucose response.

There is no exact dosage relationship between glyburide tablets and other oral hypoglycemic agents. Although patients may transition from the maximum dose of other sulfonylureas, it is important to adhere to the maximum starting dose of 5 mg of glyburide. A maintenance dose of 5 mg of glyburide provides approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 to 375 mg of chlorpropamide, 250 to 375 mg of tolazamide, 500 to 750 mg of acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg of tolbutamide.

When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily, it is recommended that they start with a daily dose of 5 mg glyburide, accompanied by a 50% reduction in insulin dose. Progressive withdrawal of insulin and an increase of glyburide in increments of 1.25 to 2.5 mg every 2 to 10 days should then be carried out. During this conversion period, when both insulin and glyburide are being used, hypoglycemia may occur. It is crucial for patients to test their urine for glucose and acetone at least three times daily and report the results to their physician. The presence of persistent acetonuria with glycosuria indicates that the patient is a Type I diabetic who requires insulin therapy.

### Glyburide/metformin combination product is safe and efficacious in patients with type 2 diabetes failing sulphonylurea therapy [^116ucyso]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a fixed combination of glyburide/metformin with those of glyburide or metformin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by sulphonylurea, diet, and exercise.

In this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, 639 patients with inadequate glycemic control on at least a half-maximal dose of sulphonylurea were randomly assigned to receive glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. (n = 164), metformin 500 mg (n = 153), glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg (n = 160), or glyburide/metformin 5 mg/500 mg (n = 162). Titration was allowed to maximum doses of 2000 mg for metformin or 10 mg/2000 mg and 20 mg/2000 mg for glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg and 5 mg/500 mg, respectively. The primary outcome measure was the HbA1c level after 16 weeks; secondary endpoints included fasting and 2-hour post-prandial plasma glucose levels. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded and summarized by treatment group.

Both strengths of glyburide/metformin reduced mean HbA1c by 1.7% more than glyburide alone (p < 0.001) and by 1.9% more than metformin alone (p < 0.001). Final mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations were also lower in both glyburide/metformin groups than in the glyburide group (-2.8 mmol/l, -51.3 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and the metformin group (-3.6 mmol/l, -64.2 mg/dl; p < 0.001). Safety and tolerability were similar across all treatment groups, except for a higher incidence of gastrointestinal AEs in the metformin monotherapy group and more patients reporting mild or moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### Rybelsus [^111DfJ8J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment with RYBELSUS 7 mg and RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily for 26 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to sitagliptin 100 mg once daily.

- **Intent-to-treat population**: The study included all randomized patients. At week 26, the primary HbA1c endpoint was missing for 5.8%, 6.2%, and 4.5% of patients randomized to RYBELSUS 7 mg, RYBELSUS 14 mg, and sitagliptin 100 mg, respectively. Missing values were imputed using a pattern mixture model with multiple imputation. The pattern was defined by randomized treatment and treatment status at week 26.

- **Additional medication**: During the trial, additional anti-diabetic medication was initiated as an add-on to randomized treatment by 2.4%, 1.1%, and 2.8% of patients randomized to RYBELSUS 7 mg, RYBELSUS 14 mg, and sitagliptin 100 mg, respectively.

- **Estimated outcomes**: Outcomes were estimated using an ANCOVA based on data regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication, adjusted for baseline value, background medication, and region.

### Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide versus dulaglutide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^111J8NDH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are appealing as glucose-lowering therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as they also reduce body weight and are associated with low rates of hypoglycemia. This analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg vs. dulaglutide 1.5 mg (two once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists) from a UK healthcare payer perspective, based on the head-to-head SUSTAIN 7 trial, to inform healthcare decision-making.

- **Materials and methods**: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0). Baseline cohort characteristics, changes in physiological parameters, and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SUSTAIN 7 trial. Costs to a healthcare payer were assessed, capturing pharmacy costs and costs of complications. Utilities were taken from published sources.

- **Results**: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 35 with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and GBP 106 with the once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, resulting from fewer diabetes-related complications due to better glycemic control. Therefore, both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were considered dominant vs. dulaglutide 1.5 mg (improving outcomes and reducing costs).

Compared with treatment with dulaglutide, once-weekly semaglutide represents a more cost-effective option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

- **Interventions**: Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results showed baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years), treatment effects were observed.

### A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis comparing once-weekly semaglutide with other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving 1–2 oral anti-diabetic drugs [^115s3v9Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed in accordance with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), ISPOR, and the Cochrane Institute to compare the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The primary intervention of interest was once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), and the primary comparators of interest were all other licensed doses of GLP-1 RAs: liraglutide once-daily (QD), dulaglutide once-weekly (QW), exenatide twice-daily (BID), exenatide QW, lixisenatide QD, and albiglutide QW. While albiglutide is soon to be withdrawn from the market, it remains a comparator of interest as the reason for withdrawal was not related to the safety of the medicine.

GLP-1 RAs were often taken with other background anti-diabetic medications in the trials. To reduce variability between populations across different trials, the definition of the add-on to 1–2 oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) population was aligned as closely as possible with the relevant SUSTAIN trials of once-weekly semaglutide (the primary intervention of interest). Therefore, studies assessing GLP-1 RAs as an add-on to one OAD (defined as > 90% of patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, sufficiently similar to the patient population in SUSTAIN 2 or 7) or as an add-on to 1–2 OADs (defined as < 100% of patients inadequately controlled on two OADs, sufficiently similar to the patient population in SUSTAIN 3 and 4) were considered for inclusion. Trials involving patients inadequately controlled on one OAD that was not metformin were excluded.

### The cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous semaglutide versus empagliflozin in type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin alone in Denmark [^111NiBGR]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

In a recent cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) conducted by Ramos et al, empagliflozin plus metformin was proven to be cost-effective and even dominant, providing better health outcomes with lower costs, compared to oral semaglutide plus metformin in the UK setting when effects on hospitalization rates due to heart failure were taken into account. That effect, compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists, was observed in a real-world study and was not implemented in the analysis.

Empagliflozin has also shown a positive impact on patients with a history of cardiovascular (CV) disease. This resulted in a CEA based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, suggesting that empagliflozin is highly cost-effective in the UK for treating people with diabetes and high cardiovascular disease compared to placebo. Additionally, previous work comparing empagliflozin and liraglutide has shown the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in this population in the Danish setting.

There are certain limitations pertaining to the present analysis. First, the long-term cost-effectiveness results for subcutaneous (SC) semaglutide plus metformin versus empagliflozin plus metformin were based on projections of short-term outcomes on surrogate endpoints, as reported in Capehorn et al, using pooled data. No direct comparisons between empagliflozin have been conducted; thus, the short-term effects are based on a network meta-analysis. Also, no long-term studies have been conducted showing the impact on hard outcomes in this population with inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone. This warrants more robust clinical trials with long-term endpoints among the comparators of interest to provide more comprehensive evidence.

### Impact of baseline characteristics and beta-cell function on the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide: a patient-level, pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials [^112NAFmq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Reductions in body weight (BW) for semaglutide 0.5 mg ranged from −3.4 kg (other oral antidiabetic drugs [OADs]) to −4.2 kg (treatment‐naïve), and for semaglutide 1.0 mg ranged from −4.9 kg (treatment‐naïve) to −6.5 kg (basal insulin plus metformin).

Due to the limitations of comparisons using pooled data and data from individual trials (as described in section 2.3), subgroup effects were only analyzed in the background medication subgroups of metformin monotherapy and other OADs (SUSTAIN 2‐4). For the 0.5 mg semaglutide dose, there were no significant effects on the change from baseline in HbA1c (P = 0.114) or BW loss (P = 0.273). For the 1.0 mg dose, a significant difference was observed for BW loss (P = 0.034), but not for the change from baseline in HbA1c (P = 0.432), between metformin monotherapy and other OADs.

The proportions of subjects achieving the composite endpoint ranged from 42.0% to 66.4% for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 56.8% to 69.5% for semaglutide 1.0 mg. The lowest proportions of subjects achieving the composite endpoint were observed in those receiving other OADs for both semaglutide doses.

### Once-weekly semaglutide reduces Hba1c and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background common OAD: a subgroup analysis from SUSTAIN 2–4 and 10 [^1115f89a]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Despite treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), achieving effective glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains a challenge. The objective of this post hoc analysis of data from the SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4, and 10 active-controlled trials was to assess the efficacy and safety of the once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide in patients on background treatment with metformin (MET), with or without a sulphonylurea (SU).

- **Methods**: Data from the randomized phase 3 trials SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4, and 10 for subjects who received background MET alone or MET+SU were analyzed. Change from baseline in Hba1c and body weight at the end of treatment visit (week 30 in SUSTAIN 4 and 10, week 56 in SUSTAIN 2 and 3), and rates of hypoglycemia and adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation were assessed.

- **Results**: In total, 3411 subjects were included in the full analysis set (3410 in the safety analysis set). Across the four trials, semaglutide significantly reduced Hba1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.32 to -0.79%-points for semaglutide 0.5 mg, and -0.38 to -1.07%-points for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs comparators; p < 0.01) in subjects receiving both MET and MET+SU. Regardless of background OAD, semaglutide significantly reduced body weight (ETD -2.35 to -4.72 kg for semaglutide 0.5 mg, and -2.96 to -6.76 kg for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs comparators; p < 0.0001). Across the trials, hypoglycemic events were more common with background MET+SU than MET alone in subjects receiving either semaglutide or a comparator.

The rate of adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation requires further investigation to understand its implications fully.

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: patient-level meta-analysis [^115VUoKs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Fixed and random effects, such as baseline covariates, that could influence outcomes were explored. These can be broadly categorized into two groups: prognostic factors and effect modifiers. Prognostic factors affect outcomes independent of treatment, whereas effect modifiers affect outcomes that are dependent on treatment and the level of the variable. Prognostic factors and effect modifiers can be selected and included in statistical models to address variations in the trial/population resulting from the lack of randomization. In individual patient data (IPD) meta-regression analyses, potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers can be adjusted at an individual patient level, allowing for a better isolation of the effect of a single factor (treatment) on an outcome of interest than might be achieved with published aggregate data, thereby enabling a potentially less-biased comparison between trials.

Through a combination of statistical analyses of data on file, consultation with clinical experts, and review of published literature, the potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers were identified and incorporated into each model in our analyses. Although patient selection and duration were consistent across trials, we followed the recommendations for unanchored indirect comparison analyses provided by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit Technical Support Document 18. These recommendations state that potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers should be determined a priori, starting with the identification of those factors of clinical relevance.

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: Patient-level meta-analysis [^113hk1fL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) management.

- **Objective**: We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology.

- **Design, setting, participants, and interventions**: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed.

- **Results**: Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss response.

### Orally administered semaglutide versus GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving 1–2 oral antidiabetics: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116i3b6r]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

An NMA was performed in accordance with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), ISPOR, and the Cochrane Institute, to assess the relative efficacy of orally administered semaglutide compared with GLP-1 RAs for the treatment of T2D as an add-on to 1–2 OADs. In the analysis, the primary intervention of interest was orally administered semaglutide 14 mg QD and the primary comparators of interest were all licensed doses of injectable GLP-1 RAs — liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide twice daily (BID), exenatide extended release, lixisenatide, and subcutaneously administered semaglutide once weekly (QW).

Albiglutide was withdrawn from the market in 2018 and therefore was not considered a relevant comparator in the NMA. GLP-1 RAs were often taken with other background antidiabetic medications in the trials. To reduce variability between populations across the different trials, the definition of the population receiving an add-on to 1–2 OADs was aligned as closely as possible to populations in the relevant PIONEER trials of orally administered semaglutide (the primary intervention of interest).

The trial population in PIONEER 2 was patients inadequately controlled on metformin, and the trial populations in PIONEER 3, 4, and 7 were patients inadequately controlled on 1–2 OADs (metformin ± sulfonylureas) in PIONEER 3, metformin ± SGLT2i in PIONEER 4, and 1–2 OADs (metformin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2i or thiazolidinediones) in PIONEER 7.

### Effect of once-weekly semaglutide versus thrice-daily insulin aspart, both as add-on to metformin and optimized insulin glargine treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 11): A randomized, open-label, multinational, phase 3b trial [^113P2SSH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of once-weekly (OW) semaglutide versus thrice-daily (TID) insulin aspart (IAsp) in participants with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with insulin glargine (IGlar) and metformin, the SUSTAIN 11 (NCT03689374) trial was conducted. This was a randomized (1:1), parallel, open-label, multinational, phase 3b trial. After a 12-week run-in to optimize once-daily IGlar U100, 1748 adults with T2D (HbA1c > 7.5% to ≤ 10.0%) were randomized to OW semaglutide or TID IAsp as add-on to optimized IGlar and metformin for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from randomization to week 52. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic episodes and change in body weight (BW). Safety was assessed.

HbA1c (randomization: 8.6% [70.0 mmol/mol]) decreased by 1.5% points (16.6 mmol/mol) and 1.2% points (13.4 mmol/mol) with semaglutide (n = 874) and IAsp (n = 874), respectively (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.29% points [95% confidence interval {CI} -0.38; -0.20]; P < 0.0001 for non-inferiority). Few severe hypoglycemic episodes were recorded in either group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Change in BW from randomization (87.9 kg) to week 52 favored semaglutide (-4.1 kg) versus IAsp (+2.8 kg) (ETD -6.99 kg [95% CI -7.41; -6.57]). A higher proportion of participants experienced adverse events with semaglutide (58.5%) versus IAsp (52.1%); most were mild to moderate.

### Long-term cost-effectiveness analyses of empagliflozin versus oral semaglutide, in addition to metformin, for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the UK [^111BrtYE]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Three lines of treatment were analyzed: empagliflozin or oral semaglutide in addition to metformin, initial intensification with empagliflozin or oral semaglutide in addition to insulin glargine, and further intensification with high-dose insulin glargine alone.

When the effect of treatment on hospital heart failure (hHF) was not considered, empagliflozin plus metformin was associated with decreases in overall costs by GBP 6161. It also resulted in slightly lower life-years gained (−0.007) and QALYs gained (−0.033) compared with oral semaglutide plus metformin. Assuming a willingness to pay/accept threshold of GBP 20,000 per QALY gained, empagliflozin plus metformin resulted in a net monetary benefit (NMB) of GBP 5501. As the NMB is greater than the incremental cost, empagliflozin plus metformin can be considered cost-effective compared with oral semaglutide plus metformin, even when the effect of treatment on hHF is not considered.

- **Exploratory scenario analyses**: The results of the exploratory scenario analyses are presented. In the first scenario analysis, following initial treatment intensification with insulin glargine plus empagliflozin or oral semaglutide, patients who subsequently exceeded the HbA1c threshold of 7.5% underwent further intensification with a higher dose of insulin glargine alone. Empagliflozin plus metformin provided additional life-years gain (0.012) but had a slightly lower QALY gain (−0.025) and was less costly compared with oral semaglutide plus metformin (−GBP 2094) in the analysis that included the benefit on hHF.

### Pharmacodynamics of glyburide, metformin, and glyburide/metformin combination therapy in the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus [^116R8zZ2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

In gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), women are unable to compensate for the increased insulin resistance during pregnancy. Data are limited regarding the pharmacodynamic effects of metformin and glyburide during pregnancy. This study characterized insulin sensitivity (SI), β-cell responsivity, and disposition index (DI) in women with GDM utilizing a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) before and during treatment with glyburide monotherapy (GLY, n = 38), metformin monotherapy (MET, n = 34), or GLY and MET combination therapy (COMBO; n = 36). GLY significantly decreased dynamic β-cell responsivity by 31%. MET and COMBO significantly increased SI by 121% and 83%, respectively. Whereas GLY, MET, and COMBO improved DI, metformin (MET and COMBO) demonstrated a larger increase in DI (P = 0.05) and a larger decrease in MMTT peak glucose concentrations (P = 0.03) compared to subjects taking only GLY. Maximizing SI with MET followed by increasing β-cell responsivity with GLY or supplementing with insulin might be a more optimal strategy for GDM management than monotherapy.

### Oral semaglutide: Dosage in special situations [^112PdKXe]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide advises that dose escalation should occur after one month. This guidance aims to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms and maximize patient comfort.

However, there may be situations where patients require urgent glucose control to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Some individuals may be concerned about their glucose levels and seek early control.

If such patients demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, dose up-titration may be considered after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms and how to mitigate them.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus once-daily insulin glargine as add-on to metformin (with or without sulfonylureas) in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 4): A randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational, phase 3a trial [^111tUCcu]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Several pharmacological treatment options are available for type 2 diabetes; however, many patients do not achieve optimum glycaemic control, and therefore new therapies are necessary. We assessed the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue in clinical development, compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with metformin (with or without sulfonylureas).

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational, phase 3a trial (SUSTAIN 4) at 196 sites in 14 countries. Eligible participants were insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 18 years and older, who had insufficient glycaemic control with metformin either alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea.

	- We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to either subcutaneous once-weekly 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide (doses reached after following a fixed dose-escalation regimen) or once-daily insulin glargine (starting dose 10 IU per day, then titrated weekly to a pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose target of 4.0–5.5 mmol/L [72–99 mg/dL]) for 30 weeks. In all treatment groups, previous background metformin and sulfonylurea treatment was continued throughout the trial. Randomisation was conducted using an interactive voice or web response system.

	- The primary endpoint was change in mean HbA1c from baseline to week 30, and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was the change in mean bodyweight from baseline to week 30. We assessed efficacy and safety in the modified intent-to-treat population.

### Oral semaglutide: Dosage in special situations [^115KTs4W]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Oral semaglutide is a safe drug with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, if there is a sudden change in lifestyle or dietary pattern, there is typically no need to alter the dose of semaglutide. It is essential to counsel the patient to report such developments to the treating physician, as it may be necessary to modify the dosage of concomitant sulfonylurea or insulin therapy.

The mean baseline body weight was 93.2 kg, 95.5 kg, and 92.9 kg in the placebo, liraglutide 1.8 mg, and RYBELSUS 14 mg arms, respectively. The mean changes from baseline to week 26 were -0.5 kg, -3.1 kg, and -4.4 kg in the placebo, liraglutide 1.8 mg, and RYBELSUS 14 mg arms, respectively. The difference from placebo (95% CI) for RYBELSUS 14 mg was -3.8 kg (-4.7, -3.0). The difference from liraglutide 1.8 mg for RYBELSUS 14 mg was -1.2 (-1.9, -0.6).

- **Combination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment with metformin alone, sulfonylurea alone, basal insulin alone, or metformin in combination with either sulfonylurea or basal insulin**: In a 26-week, double-blind trial (NCT02827708), 324 adult patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFRCKD-EPI30–59 mL/min/1.73 m²) were randomized to RYBELSUS 14 mg or placebo once daily. RYBELSUS was added to the patient's stable pre-trial antidiabetic regimen. The insulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients on basal insulin. Dose reduction of insulin and sulfonylurea was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up-titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre-trial dose.

### Effect of once-weekly semaglutide versus thrice-daily insulin aspart, both as add-on to metformin and optimized insulin glargine treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 11): A randomized, open-label, multinational, phase 3b trial [^1137qxho]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Participants underwent a 2-week screening period, followed by 12-week run-in, 52-week treatment, and 5-week follow-up periods (Figure S1). At the start of the run-in, participants were transferred from their previous once- or twice-daily basal insulin (BI) injections to subcutaneous (s.c.) once-daily insulin glargine (IGlar U100). Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles were used to optimize the IGlar dose during the run-in and throughout the trial. For further details on the titration algorithms, see the supporting information. Participants continued metformin treatment (1500–3000 mg or the maximum tolerated dose) throughout the trial unless related safety concerns arose; additional oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) were discontinued.

At the end of the run-in period, participants with HbA1c levels of more than 7.5% to 10.0% (> 58 to ≤ 86 mmol/mol) were randomized 1:1 to receive once-weekly (OW) semaglutide 1.0 mg or thrice-daily (TID) insulin aspart (IAsp) 100 U/ml injections from week 0 (randomization/baseline) to week 52 (end of treatment [EOT]). Participants randomized to OW semaglutide underwent dose escalation as per label. Semaglutide dose reduction from 1.0 to 0.5 mg was allowed for safety concerns or unacceptable intolerability.

Participants randomized to IAsp were initiated at 4 U TID. Dose adjustments of both IGlar and IAsp were based on SMPG measurements according to the titration guidelines (supporting information) and individualized treatment goals, at the investigator's discretion. Persistent and/or unacceptable hyperglycemia was initially managed with the adjustment of insulin doses, followed by rescue medication, at the investigator's discretion.

### Efficacy of glyburide/metformin tablets compared with initial monotherapy in type 2 diabetes [^112jDk7t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve or maintain the American Diabetes Association's recommended treatment goal of glycosylated hemoglobin levels. This multicenter, double-blind trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control [glycosylated hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C), > 7% and < 12%] with diet and exercise alone to compare the benefits of initial therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets versus metformin or glyburide monotherapy.

Patients (n = 486) were randomized to receive glyburide/metformin tablets (1.25/250 mg), metformin (500 mg), or glyburide (2.5 mg). Changes in A1C, fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine, serum lipids, body weight, and 2-hour postprandial glucose following a standardized meal were assessed after 16 weeks of treatment. Glyburide/metformin tablets caused a superior mean reduction in A1C from baseline (-2.27%) compared to metformin (-1.53%) and glyburide (-1.90%) monotherapy (P = 0.0003). Glyburide/metformin also significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose values compared with either monotherapy. The final mean doses of glyburide/metformin (3.7/735 mg) were lower than those of metformin (1796 mg) and glyburide (7.6 mg).

First-line treatment with glyburide/metformin tablets provided superior glycemic control over component monotherapy, allowing more patients to achieve American Diabetes Association treatment goals with lower component doses in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Effect of once-weekly semaglutide versus thrice-daily insulin aspart, both as add-on to metformin and optimized insulin glargine treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 11): A randomized, open-label, multinational, phase 3b trial [^115nWPzq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

The SUSTAIN 11 results showed that once-weekly (OW) semaglutide was non-inferior (P < 0.0001) to thrice-daily (TID) insulin aspart (IAsp) for glycemic control in basal insulin (BI)-treated participants with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D), with a greater decrease in HbA1c over 52 weeks observed with semaglutide versus IAsp. Furthermore, a greater proportion of participants achieved HbA1c targets of 7.5% or less, less than 7.0%, and 6.5% or less with semaglutide versus IAsp (P < 0.0001). Although the estimated BI dose decreased with both semaglutide and IAsp, the reduction in HbA1c was still greater with semaglutide.

Improvements in glycemic control in both arms were accompanied by a very low (and lower than expected) risk for severe hypoglycemia, which was probably a result of the comparatively conservative insulin titration algorithms (with broad limits for no adjustments between 4.0 and 6.9 mmol/L) and broad HbA1c targets (individualized targets ranged from 6.5% to 7.5%), as well as increased caution and awareness from investigators in the context of a population with advanced T2D. All other non-severe, clinically significant hypoglycemic endpoints favored semaglutide over IAsp.

Reductions in HbA1c were accompanied by weight loss with semaglutide, whereas body weight (BW) increases were observed with IAsp; there was a numerical treatment difference in BW of 6.99 kg at the end of treatment (EOT) for semaglutide versus IAsp. Furthermore, higher proportions of participants achieved weight-loss responses of 5% or higher or 10% or higher with semaglutide compared with IAsp (P < 0.0001). This reflects the known effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and insulins on BW previously shown in other studies.

### In overweight or obese adults without diabetes, semaglutide increased weight loss and GI disorders [^112ox37B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine examined the effects of once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity. The research demonstrated that semaglutide significantly increased weight loss in individuals without diabetes. Additionally, it was observed that the medication led to an increase in gastrointestinal disorders. The findings contribute to the understanding of semaglutide's role in weight management and its potential side effects. The study offers insight into the benefits and risks associated with the use of semaglutide for weight reduction.

- **Endpoints**: The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c (% points) from randomization to the end of treatment (EOT). For further information on the primary estimand (hypothetical estimand), see the supporting information. Confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoints included the time to the first event adjudication committee (EAC)-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode; time to the first EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode requiring hospitalization or documented medical help, or that was life-threatening; and change in body weight (BW) in kilograms from randomization to EOT.

- **Secondary endpoints**: For other prespecified supportive secondary endpoints evaluating glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, anthropometric and patient-reported outcomes, see the supporting information. The following hypoglycaemic episodes were assessed: severe, documented symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pseudo-hypoglycaemia (≤ 3.9 mmol/L cut-off [> 3.9 mmol/L for pseudo-hypoglycaemia] as per the American Diabetes Association [ADA] 2013 definition); clinically significant hypoglycaemia (< 3.0 mmol/L cut-off, ADA 2018 definition); symptomatic or asymptomatic blood glucose (BG)-confirmed hypoglycaemia (< 3.1 mmol/L cut-off).

- **Safety endpoints**: These included the occurrence of adverse events (AEs); serious AEs (≥ 0.5% in any arm) by system organ class (SOC); AEs with fatal outcomes by SOC; and AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation. An external independent committee, blinded to treatment allocation, adjudicated the following events: severe hypoglycaemic episode, acute pancreatitis, and all deaths (for either association with severe hypoglycaemic episode [ADA definition] or acute pancreatitis).

### An indirect treatment comparison of semaglutide 2.0 mg vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg using multilevel network meta-regression [^115ATBcm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) provide an effective treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), offering improved glycemic control alongside weight management and cardiovascular benefits. Treatment guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs across the treatment pathway for patients with T2D not adequately controlled on metformin alone and as a preferred option for those with established cardiovascular disease, regardless of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Semaglutide and dulaglutide are both long-acting GLP-1 RAs, administered once weekly via subcutaneous injection. However, they differ in molecular structure, resulting in potential differences in their metabolic effects. Understanding the impact of these differences on clinical outcomes is important for clinicians.

Semaglutide and dulaglutide have both been investigated extensively as part of the SUSTAIN and AWARD clinical trial programs, respectively. A head-to-head trial, SUSTAIN 7, compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide and dulaglutide at lower doses (semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg) and higher doses (semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg) in patients with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin. The superiority of semaglutide compared with dulaglutide was demonstrated regarding reducing HbA1c and body weight at week 40.
