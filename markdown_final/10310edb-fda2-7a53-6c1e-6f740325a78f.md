## Question

Soap note for cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a SOAP note for cystitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the SOAP structure and how to apply it to cystitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach for acute uncomplicated cystitis versus recurrent or complicated presentations. Next, I will review objective testing thresholds and when to culture. After that, I need to check treatment choices, durations, and stewardship nuances. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and documentation best practices, ensuring each element is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the SOAP framework and its purpose. SOAP organizes clinical reasoning into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, which improves communication, supports billing, and reduces errors; I should ensure each section is concise, relevant, and avoids copying redundant data from the chart, aligning with pediatric documentation guidance and quality improvement literature on structured notes [^6203dddc] [^7147e151].

> Now, Subjective: I need to capture the core lower urinary tract symptoms and their time course, including dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort, and nocturia, and I should explicitly ask about vaginal discharge or irritation to help distinguish cystitis from vaginitis; I should also screen for fever, flank pain, chills, or systemic symptoms that would push me toward pyelonephritis or complicated infection, and I should confirm symptom chronicity to separate acute from recurrent disease, since recurrent UTI is defined as at least two symptomatic episodes in 6 months or three in 12 months, with at least one culture-proven infection [^c9156f44] [^edb6fcbe].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic weight of symptom combinations. The combination of sudden-onset dysuria plus frequency without vaginal discharge confers about a 90% probability of UTI, whereas isolated symptoms or atypical presentations lower that probability and should prompt culture before treatment; I should document this probability-based reasoning to justify empiric therapy or testing strategy [^db61e36c].

> Next, Objective: I should confirm vitals, including temperature, and perform a focused exam of the abdomen and suprapubic area for tenderness, and a genital exam to assess for vaginal discharge or irritation; I need to check for costovertebral angle tenderness to exclude pyelonephritis. For testing, I should obtain urinalysis with dipstick for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and microscopy for pyuria, and I should reserve urine culture for recurrent UTIs, treatment failure, atypical presentations, patients older than 65, or males; in women with classic symptoms and no complicating factors, empiric treatment without culture is acceptable, but I should double-check local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks before deciding [^d430b8bf] [^212a7d11] [^7d21489d].

> Hold on, I should verify culture thresholds and stewardship language. For recurrent UTI, guidelines recommend obtaining urinalysis and culture with susceptibilities prior to treatment to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy; I should document the rationale if I deviate from this, for example if the patient is severely ill or access to timely culture is limited, and I should plan to narrow therapy once results return [^68b5e22b] [^63925907].

> Assessment: I will now examine how to phrase this precisely. For acute uncomplicated cystitis in a nonpregnant, immunocompetent woman with classic symptoms and no red flags, I can state "Acute uncomplicated cystitis (rUTI if applicable)"; if symptoms are atypical or complicating factors exist, I should broaden to "possible complicated UTI" and specify the concern, such as male sex, pregnancy, immunocompromise, recent instrumentation, or structural disease; if vaginal discharge is present, I should consider vaginitis or cervicitis and defer UTI treatment until evaluation is complete [^c9156f44] [^212a7d11].

> Plan: I need to ensure antibiotic choice, duration, and alternatives are guideline-concordant. First-line options for uncomplicated cystitis include nitrofurantoin 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 3 days if local resistance is under 20%, or single-dose fosfomycin; I should avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to collateral damage and reserve them for resistance-driven scenarios; for males with uncomplicated UTI, a 7-day oral course is recommended; for recurrent UTI, I should consider culture-directed therapy and discuss nonantibiotic strategies such as hydration, d-mannose, or methenamine with shared decision-making; I should also offer acetaminophen or NSAIDs for symptom relief and consider a delayed or backup prescription if the patient prefers watchful waiting and there are no signs of progression [^2834ddd5] [^822aaf96] [^4670799a] [^92464a86] [^4a4fd215].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has antimicrobial resistance risk? In pregnancy, I should confirm the diagnosis with culture showing at least 10⁵ CFU/mL and treat with beta-lactams considered safe in pregnancy; in patients with ESBL risk or prior resistant isolates, I should obtain culture and consider nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible, or use IDSA guidance for ESBL-E cystitis; I should document the resistance risk and the rationale for empiric choices pending sensitivities [^8bb4d359] [^c5b8f351] [^0753f3b4].

> I should double-check follow-up and safety netting. For uncomplicated cases, advise return if fever, flank pain, vomiting, or symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours; for recurrent UTI, I should arrange follow-up to review culture results, assess for modifiable risk factors, and consider evaluation for bladder or bowel dysfunction, and in select cases discuss prophylaxis; I need to ensure I document patient education and shared decision-making, especially when using nonantibiotic strategies or delayed prescriptions [^68b5e22b] [^89c3b649].

> Finally, documentation hygiene matters. I should avoid copying forward irrelevant data, keep the note problem-focused, and include only what supports care, billing, and quality reporting; I should also timestamp entries and sign legibly, and if I use templates, I should customize them to the encounter to prevent errors and improve readability, consistent with pediatric EHR documentation guidance and SOAP best practices [^6203dddc] [^7147e151].

A SOAP note for cystitis should document **typical lower urinary tract symptoms** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort) [^c9156f44] and exclude vaginal discharge or systemic features to support an uncomplicated diagnosis [^212a7d11]. Objective findings include **urinalysis with pyuria and bacteriuria** [^7d21489d]; obtain a urine culture for recurrent UTIs, atypical presentations, or treatment failure [^d430b8bf]. Assessment is "uncomplicated cystitis" if symptoms are classic and there are no complicating factors. The plan should include **first-line antibiotics** (nitrofurantoin 5 days, TMP-SMX 3 days, or fosfomycin single dose) [^2834ddd5] [^9b1ec760], analgesia, and patient education on hydration and follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen [^92464a86] [^4a4fd215].

---

## Subjective (S)

Document the patient's **chief complaint** and **history of present illness**, including:

- **Chief complaint**: Dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort.
- **Onset and duration**: Acute onset over the past 24–48 hours.
- **Associated symptoms**: Hematuria, suprapubic pressure, nocturia.
- **Exclusions**: No fever, chills, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or vaginal discharge [^c9156f44].
- **Medical history**: Prior UTIs, diabetes, immunocompromise, pregnancy, recent sexual activity, or catheter use.
- **Medications**: Current medications, including antibiotics or immunosuppressants.
- **Allergies**: Document any drug allergies, especially to antibiotics.

---

## Objective (O)

Record **vital signs** and perform a focused physical examination, and order indicated tests:

| **Vital signs** | **Temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate** |
|-|-|
| General appearance | Well-appearing, no distress |
| Abdominal exam | Suprapubic tenderness, no flank tenderness |
| Genital exam | No vaginal discharge or irritation |
| Urinalysis | Pyuria, bacteriuria, positive leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites [^notfound] |
| Urine culture | Obtain if recurrent UTI, atypical presentation, or treatment failure [^d430b8bf] |

---

## Assessment (A)

The assessment should include the **diagnosis** — uncomplicated cystitis — and the **rationale**, noting classic lower urinary tract symptoms without systemic or vaginal symptoms [^c9156f44].

---

## Plan (P)

The plan should include **antibiotic therapy**, **symptomatic management**, and **patient education**:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: First-line options include nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days (if local resistance is < 20%), or fosfomycin 3 g single dose [^2834ddd5] [^9b1ec760].
- **Symptomatic management**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain relief [^92464a86].
- **Patient education**: Hydration, avoid irritants, return if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or worsen [^4a4fd215].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate if symptoms persist or recur; consider further evaluation for recurrent UTIs [^68b5e22b].

---

A SOAP note for cystitis should succinctly capture the **clinical picture**, guide appropriate testing, and outline evidence-based treatment and follow-up.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^89c3b649]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Health care provider satisfaction with a new electronic progress note format: SOAP vs APSO format… [^3b2ca8d7]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Using a prospective, observational design, we compared the time it took for health care providers to answer clinical questions from SOAP format notes vs APSO format notes. We compared mean time to respond to all questions using the paired t test and used linear regression to control for the order of questions. P <. 05 was considered statistically significant. The institutional review board approved the study. Six primary care and 2 specialty clinics chose to mandate the APSO format, whereas 3 primary care and 2 specialty clinics chose a voluntary APSO format. All 47 health care providers in the "mandatory" clinics and 37 of 73 health care providers in the "voluntary" clinics adopted APSO after 2 months. Respondents reported that "finding clinically relevant data" was "easier" or "much easier" with APSO.

Similarly, respondents reported "faster" or "much faster" browsing through EHR notes with APSO and they "preferred" or "strongly preferred" reading notes with the APSO format. When asked about "ease of following the flow of clinical reasoning across multiple notes, " a majority supported APSO. Seven health care providers were timed while reviewing 10 APSO notes followed by 10 SOAP notes, and 7 health care providers were timed reviewing 10 SOAP notes followed by 10 APSO notes. There was no statistically significant difference between the time taken to answer questions about APSO vs SOAP notes. Of 120 questions, 4 were answered incorrectly from SOAP notes and 3 of 120 were answered incorrectly from APSO notes. Particularly, 83% reported that APSO was faster, and 81% noted that it was easier to find data in APSO notes.

However, in our small sample, we were unable to detect a difference in the time health care providers took to answer questions from APSO vs SOAP notes. Further studies are needed to determine whether these outpatient findings at one center can apply to another, or to inpatient or emergency department settings, or even to radiology and pathology reports.

### Electronic documentation in pediatrics: the rationale and functionality requirements [^6203dddc]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric electronic documentation — SOAP note guidance, safety considerations, and educational impact are outlined: Documentation standards should include recommendations regarding electronic documentation functionalities (copy and paste, copy and forward, automated insertion), and misuse can result in inaccurate, outdated, or irrelevant information with potential quality and liability consequences. For copying and pasting, "the Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety made 4 recommendations that could improve the safety of its use: making copied and pasted text readily identifiable, referencing the text's origin, providing education on its safe use, and having practices in place to monitor its use". SOAP note guidance emphasizes succinct, original, accurate, problem-based notes with explicit directives including "Document only what you must to support patient care, accurate billing, and other newly defined minimum standards. Be specific"., "Do not repeat or copy what is already available in the record (data and/or other notes)"., "Include only relevant patient data that is are accurate and timely"., and "Evolve to a problem-oriented medical record". The goal "should be complying with billing, coding, and payer guidelines and providing data for quality reporting programs but also following best practices for electronic documentation". In medical education, "The EHR is an essential part of the daily work of medical students" and "Medical interns are estimated to spend 40% of their time dealing with EHR systems".

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^e835d1d7]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Measures

We calculated the notes expected to be filled under SOAP format during the 24 hours of a patient's stay and identified them as eligible notes. One note, each from the day and the night shift, that is, two out of four notes constituted eligible notes.

We studied ward-round notes wherein 'all' four headings of the SOAP template were used. Our consultant also studied whether information conveyed against each heading was appropriate and relevant to it. Our outcome measure was the percentage of notes written in SOAP format. Our primary process measure was compliance with the acronym on ward-round case sheets. We also monitored our compliance to our subsequent change idea in which we used visual prompters on the department information board. Our balancing measures were paediatrician and patient feedback during the implementation of the SOAP acronym.

Analysis

The outcome of the project was analysed using standard run charts which identified statistical significance in the outcome measure assessed on a regular basis. Based on run-chart rules proposed by Anhøj and Olesen, we saw a shift in the run on one side of the median, so we revised and calculated a new median. Also, towards the end of every cycle we collected team feedback using group discussions, focusing on the 'specific' intervention to learn team experiences and sentiments.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^f41ef943]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Over testing for UTIs is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture in the absence of vaginal symptoms are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis, however, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER. In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740). While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed the ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that over‐testing of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture‐negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient‐based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture‐negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either poorly documented in the clinical record or based on point‐of‐care urine dipstick testing. While the absence of pyuria on urinalysis has a high negative predictive value and can help rule out the diagnosis, urinalysis when utilized independent of UTI symptoms should not be used to guide treatment decisions even if positive for pyuria as it has a poor positive predictive value for UTI. Given that pyuria is common among women of all ages, especially elderly women, performing an initial screening urinalysis in the absence of urinary symptoms often results in overtreatment as it may be uncomfortable for providers to withhold antibiotic treatment in the face of positive laboratory results. These principles underlie clinical guidance by the US Preventative Services Task Force and Infectious Disease Society of America both recommending against screening urinalysis in nonpregnant adults. This is why we encourage not only antibiotic stewardship but also diagnostic stewardship appropriately restricting laboratory testing to patients in whom there is significant clinical suspicion for UTI.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^cb83b0b2]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|
|Non-low risk, first option|- Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis|
|Non-low risk, second option|- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis < br > - Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture if urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria) < br > - Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.|

### Electronic documentation in pediatrics: the rationale and functionality requirements [^0e3d2331]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Electronic clinical notes in pediatrics — note structure — should be constantly reviewed across note types, and the increasing length and limited use of notes argue for a more streamlined structure in which the most important clinical information is more readily found. A proposed solution is a modified subjective, objective, assessment, plan note that retains the original SOAP structure from the paper-based era while mitigating known concerns of electronic note systems.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: AUA guideline amendment [^664965e8]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this amendment is to provide an updated clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome based upon data received since the publication of original guideline in 2011.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE(®) database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. This initial review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The AUA update literature review process, in which an additional systematic review is conducted periodically to maintain guideline currency with newly published relevant literature, was conducted in July 2013. This review identified an additional 31 articles, which were added to the evidence base of this Guideline.

Results

Newly incorporated literature describing the treatment of IC/BPS was integrated into the Guideline with additional treatment information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. The diagnostic portion of the Guideline remains unchanged from the original publication and is still based on Expert Opinions and Clinical Principles.

Conclusions

The management of IC/BPS continues to evolve as can be seen by an expanding literature on the topic. This document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient. As the science relevant to IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies presented will require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of care.

Available knowledge

Well-written case notes provide accountability, corroborate the delivery of appropriate services, support clinical decisions, promote effective communication and prevent patient harm. Inadequate communication between different health professionals is associated with discontinuity of care, which can lead to errors and compromise patient safety. In present times, clinical notes also serve as a valuable document to audit the quality of healthcare services offered, determine issuance of insurance claims and, importantly, serve as a documentary evidence for medicolegal purpose.

Despite its importance, clinical record keeping is often given a low priority, and it is common to find missing information and inconsistency between the entries. Often, there is great variability in the format of clinical notes among different healthcare professionals and hospitals in different countries. These may be influenced by the doctor's/healthcare professional's years of experience, previous incidents (i.e. lessons that have been learnt) and relevant circumstances of the case (acute deterioration of the patient, etc). In densely populated nations such as ours, an additional role is played by limited consult times from enormous caseloads, resulting in priority towards clinical interaction over documentation.

The onus for improving records lies with individual health professionals. Structuring the clinical records especially at the time of admission is known to improve the quality of information recorded. This reduces clinical errors and improves patient outcomes. In the same context, ward-round proforma or templates have been employed to standardise recording of patient progress. This has demonstrated an improvement in documentation practices, patient safety, efficiency in ward roundsas well as completeness of records. These proformas have been typically designed to capture comprehensive information pertaining to a particular specialty (eg, surgery or orthopaedics) or a disease (eg, deep venous thromboembolism).

Another method commonly applied to improve documentation practices has been audit exercises to sensitise doctors regarding their performance. This includes educating them via trainings or reminder communications to perform against a benchmark. These audits engage either a concerned specialty centric template (eg, Shark, Crabel, Star, to name a few)or adhere to norms defined by quality accreditation programmes.

Both proforma as well as audit templates have focused on comprehensive aspects of record keeping such as investigations, drug prescription, information to patients, date and time of records, and regularity besides characteristics of the clinical information. There appears to be a paucity of literature demonstrating methods focused only on the nature of the clinical information relayed in the note.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

Background

Electronic medical records use standardised templates, which guide specific entries. As compilation of records on blank sheets permits individual preferences for compilation, it risks selective and deficient entries.

Ward-round notes in our hospital, like most healthcare facilities in India, are maintained on paper. Hospital case files are composed of several paper sheets which are assembled in a uniform order throughout the hospital. Some of these sheets carry preprinted templates and some are blank, but each sheet is assigned and labelled for a specific purpose. Our hospital is accredited under the National Accreditation Board for Hospital certification, and case records are regularly subject to detailed audits which assess adherence towards exhaustive record-keeping practices including date and time of the notes, regularity, legibility, patient medication details, investigation details, nursing records, pain score, etc. These audits, however, do not reflect evaluation of the content within the notes, whose inconsistency and selective filling were our prime concern.

Rationale

Recognising our need to structure our notes, we explored the methodology used by Dolan et al, i.e. structuring of the records incorporating the subjective, objective, assessment and planning (SOAP) template. The SOAP acronym is a derivative of problem-oriented medical record practice, which warrants that clinical records be structured around the patient's problems and updated in detail on a daily basis.SOAP prototype provides the cognitive framework for clinical reasoning while serving as a reminder for specific aspects of clinical information. A progress note under this format reflected essential parameters of ongoing patient progress and treatment information. We inferred from the available literature that structuring our notes will improve information recorded and thereby quality of documentation.

It was felt that SOAP format was suited to our system for two reasons. First, it served our requirement to balance out the neglected clinical parameters and save us from the implementation of exhaustive notes which could prove labour and time intensive for a busy system like ours. Second, its simple design circumvented the need for detailed department specific proforma, which would have required multiple approvals as well as institution-wide reforms around creation of distinct case files for different departments.

Aim

Our Specific, measurable, applicable, realistic and timely (SMART) aim was to improve the quality of documentation in ward-round notes, for paediatric inpatients aged between 1 month and 15 years, by application of the SOAP template to at least 80% of the eligible notes by 6 months. Eligible notes constituted two out of all the ward-round notes written during 24 hours of an inpatient stay.

(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

4.2 Primary Endpoint Outcomes for Clinical Studies/Trials

The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain is the most accepted and used measure to describe pain at baseline and during follow up in clinical pain trials. This 11‐point measure should be strongly considered as a primary outcome in clinical trials of IC/BPS treatments. The severity of pain can be described as a point in time, average or maximum pain over a predetermined time period (suggested mean maximum or worse pain over a minimum of 3 days for each trial assessment interval). This single patient's rating of pain can be considered a PRO, but its major limitation is that it is not specific to IC/BPS. A patient with IC/BPS has multi‐dimensional pain experience as part of the clinical experience.

Voiding diaries (frequency volume charting) should be strongly considered as a primary outcome in clinical trials of IC/BPS. The consensus is to evaluate 3 separate days for an individual outcome measurement assessment. Items of relevance for IC/BPS are (per 24 h); urinary frequency, urgency and voided volumes. It is important to know that urgency experienced by IC/BPS has another dimension compared to OAB patients – typically a gradually increasing pain or discomfort during bladder filling, leading to more frequent voiding to prevent such pain. Also of note is the variations between IC/BPS patients in storage and voiding behavior can depend on availability of toilets, activities (pre‐emptive voiding before recreation, work, social activities) and fluid intake as well as individual pain avoidance voiding patterns.

The FDA‐BRUDAC committee has suggested that co‐primary outcomes should be considered in clinical trials. However, an analysis from the Multi‐Disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network points out that pain and urinary symptoms should be assessed separately rather than combined in a single score. The same might prove true using pain and urinary scores as a co‐primary outcome.

A 7‐point Global Response Assessment (GRA) has been employed as a primary endpoint, co‐primary endpoint and as a secondary endpoint in published clinical trials. Patients self‐report their perception of their clinical condition relative to baseline. The GRA assesses the patient's overall perception of difference in bladder pain and urinary symptoms (equal number of positive and negative choices) without identifying specific symptoms. Responders for the GRA were typically defined as subjects reporting that they were "markedly improved" or "moderately improved" compared with baseline.

4.6 Limitations

The committee recognizes limitations related to individual committee members' personal bias, the inherent lack of outcome reliability studies and the lack of a gold standard comparison for the various outcomes. The methodology did not employ a systematic review and rating of the evidence as required by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, but rather a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature based on expertise, experience and expert group consensus feedback. The role of cystoscopy, urodynamics, and pain mapping (considered by some as possible non‐PRO outcomes) has been addressed by the Diagnosis and Phenotype IC/BPS consensus meeting committees and have not been addressed by this PRO committee. The impact of trial design (inclusion/exclusion criteria) on research outcomes are also beyond the scope of this committee.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^2ae63704]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^2719ebd4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. One RCT24 that explored the effect of hydration on UTIs found that increased water intake significantly reduced cystitis frequency in healthy women. This RCT included 140 healthy women with recurrent cystitis, defined as 3 or more episodes in the past year, who drank less than 1. 5 L of fluid per day. Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections. 78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Based on several randomized trials, shorter courses result in comparable outcomes to longer courses and are reasonable for the treatment of cystitis in children older than 2 months of age when the likelihood of pyelonephritis is deemed to be low. 100–102 Small study size, heterogeneity in trial design, end point definitions, and outcomes, preclude a clear recommendation for duration of treatment. Based on the totality of the evidence available, we can provide clear recommendations on the optimal durations of treatment for cystitis for the antimicrobial classes listed below: Nitrofurantoin: 5 days108-110 TMP/SMX: 3 days109, 111, 112.

Fluoroquinolones: 3 days109, 113–118 Oral fosfomycin: single dose78, 119–127 Pivmecillinam: 3 days109, 128–132 Gepotidacin: 5 days133 Data are insufficient to enable clear recommendations for duration of treatment for other potential treatment options, including β-lactams and parenteral aminoglycosides. Some pediatric data support a 5-day treatment duration when oral β-lactams are used to treat cystitis. 105.

Evidence strength determination and study quality — grading and assessment approach: The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies; AUA categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A (well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies), Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies), or Grade C (observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data). Quality of individual RCTs or crossover trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and because placebo effects are common, procedural deviations that could compromise randomization or blinding resulted in a rating of increased risk of bias; the quality of individual observational studies was not assessed. Because treatment data are difficult to interpret without placebo control, bodies of evidence entirely lacking placebo controls were assigned a strength rating of Grade C.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms that predict microscopic pyuria [^42dfd058]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Ethics committee approval was obtained from the East London and the City Research Ethics Committee. All patient data were anonymized after collection.

The evolution of the symptom set

The first task was to identify symptoms that described, as thoroughly as possible, the experience of lower urinary tract infections (LUTS) from the patients' perspective in patients referred with chronic LUTS to a tertiary referral centre. A computer programme was created that enabled a clinician to record symptoms while the patients narrated them. The software functioned to accumulate lists that were easy to add to. A core set of ubiquitous symptoms rapidly evolved, with rarer and idiosyncratic experiences being added as more patients participated. At the end of their narrative, patients were asked if they were confident that they had described everything. This method was deployed in our ordinary clinical service between 1991 and 1999.

In 1999, the data were analysed and we extracted all symptoms that occurred at least as frequently as dysuria (≥ 2% of respondents), because the latter is an archetypal symptom of cystitis. These questions were then grouped into the four main categories: storage and voiding symptoms, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pain. These questions were organised into an inventory that was used to elicit symptoms from patients by direct questioning, recording a "yes" or "no" response. The patients were always asked to supplement the information with additional material applicable to their experience. In 2004, the data were analysed again and a final inventory was constructed from those symptoms described by ≥ 2% of respondents. These 39 questions are listed in Table 1.

The literature search identified multiple PROs, PROMs, questionnaires and outcomes that have been used in research studies and clinical practice. A summary of the most used outcome measures including description, validation and pertinent references is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Background summary of IC/BPS patient related outcome measures.

The committee identified 4 critical areas of interest to the goals related to outcomes in IC/BPS. These included (1) PROs for both clinical trials and clinical practice; (2) Primary outcome endpoints for clinical trials; (3) Secondary (and tertiary) PROMs for research; and (4) Best IC/BPS symptom questionnaires for characterizing and following patients in general urology practice.

Corresponding clinical questions were formulated within those areas using a modified PICO format. The detailed modified PICO questions are listed in Table 2.

Modified PICO* questions addressed by the Outcomes subcommittee.

Based on the literature review, committee expertise and experience and feedback from the IC/BPS Consensus meeting, 12 recommendations (including the strength of recommendation) were decided upon (Table 3). These are not to be construed as guideline recommendations but rather practical recommendations to consider when designing clinical studies and/or trials or following patients in general urology practice.

Consensus recommendations for Outcome Measures for IC/BPS studies, trials and general clinical practice. A STRONG recommendation implies that the outcomes committee believed that the vast majority of experts would make this recommendation based on available evidence and clinical experience. A CONDITIONAL recommendation was made when the outcome committee believed most experts would opt for the recommendation based on the evidence, however, a substantial minority of experts would choose an alternative plan.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^c9e9404c]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary

A pertinent and a succinct ward-round note is a critical link to safe care delivery. Our ward-round notes were mostly unstructured and unmethodical, compromising interprofessional communication, patient and medico-legal safety.

We selected the SOAP format noting its attribute to capture specific information while offering flexibility to the doctor relying on a simple format. Team exchanges were instrumental in learning methods to apply the concept. Use of visual reminders in the form of acronyms emerged successful in embedding the change. Special cause variation from unexpected pandemic environments had a dense impact, warranting shift in the change idea, right in the middle of the journey. Regular physician engagements and reciprocity towards their sentiments aided continued team participation especially during unforeseen disruptions.

Interpretations

Out of the four interventions tested, visual reinforcements, i.e. SOAP acronym on the case sheet and visual reminder during huddles, had stronger and sustained impact. Visual reminders proved effective even during higher caseloads. This corroborates with previously tested interventions such as prefilled templates, which demonstrate sustained impact.

Themes from team feedback revealed that structured notes translated into meaningful clinical practice. Improved reflection of plan in the notes facilitated efficient discharge preparations besides enhanced communication opportunities with the family. Systematic representation of patient assessment also facilitated early detection in clinical deterioration and timely escalation of treatment. Meaningful practice perceived with structured notes proved to be a valuable factor in maintaining gains for 5 months in the pre-COVID phase. Subsequently, a minor modification of using reminders in department information board resulted in a prompt revival after the initial COVID-19 phase. This confirmed our belief that the clinicians valued the change.

However, despite the internal motivation, 100% application was difficult to achieve, likely due to prevailing time constraints of care aspects in a country with high caseloads.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^598e6665]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^49cf53f8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^69f26821]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^74043b09]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this difference-in-differences study, we implemented a multifaceted stewardship intervention that targeted inappropriate antibiotic choice and duration of treatment. An increased proportion of guideline-adherent prescriptions was observed in the intervention period of both intervention and control sites. However, in the difference-in-differences analysis, the intervention site had a significantly larger increase in adherence than the control site.

The audit and feedback stewardship intervention was successful for UTI treatment in emergency departmentsand acuteand long-term care. In this study, we applied the audit and feedback intervention to primary care settings, where antibiotic stewardship is urgently needed. Our intervention was based on a treatment algorithm derived from the IDSA guidelines and AAFP recommendations on management of uncomplicated UTI. Our qualitative study showed that differentiating uncomplicated cystitis from other UTI syndromes is a challenge for providers; therefore, providing a set of diagnostic criteria for uncomplicated cystitis was important. This treatment algorithm describes steps that providers should take when encountered with a patient with UTI-relevant symptoms. We used this algorithm as a starting point to provide personalised, interactive, one-on-one feedback with providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated UTI and treat UTI appropriately. The content was individualised for each recipient, and specific information about the correct solution was included to maximise feedback effectiveness. Besides improvements in the clinical outcomes, we also observed that the intervention was received positively by feedback recipients.

### The MAPP research network: design, patient characterization and operations [^a9f9060c]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are defined by the hallmark symptom of chronic pain in the region of the pelvis, urogenital floor, or external genitalia, often accompanied by urinary symptoms, such as urinary urgency or frequency. The bladder has historically been thought to be the origin of IC/BPS symptoms; whereas the prostate gland has traditionally been believed to be the source of CP/CPPS symptoms. However, this viewpoint has come under recent challenge, in large part from the observation that many IC/BPS and CP/CPPS patients exhibiting symptoms do not have identifiable pathology in these organs.

The impact and burden of IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are substantial. Patients suffer considerable morbidity resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life for both the patient and his/her partner due to the physical and psychological impact of the condition. In fact, the quality of life of IC patients has been characterized as being worse than that of patients undergoing dialysis. In the U.S. the prevalence of IC/BPS symptoms has been estimated to be 2.7% in women; whereas the prevalence for analogous symptoms is estimated to be 1.3% in men. Prevalence estimates for CP/CPPS in men vary between 1.8–6.4%, depending upon case definitions and screening methods.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of IC required cystoscopy and pathological findings, although more typically IC/BPS is defined from patient reported symptoms, due to the lack of consistent pathological findings, defined disease phenotypes or biological markers. Similarly, patient symptoms are used to define CP/CPPS. Each of these separate syndromes, however, may in fact represent a group of related conditions that manifest in a similar manner, but have differing etiologies. Based primarily on their somewhat similar symptom profiles, IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are here collectively termed urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) (see Table 1 for research definitions used in the MAPP Research Network). As noted in the only published phenotyping system, referred to as UPOINT, UCPPS patients have significant symptoms across the urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and tenderness domains, confirming the heterogenous nature of these syndromes.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^d1fc4d52]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Audits on record keeping practices at our multidisciplinary hospital revealed unstructured ward-round notes which were dissimilar from each other on aspects of patient information. Written as per the discretion of the rounding physician, the practice compromised team communication and medicolegal safety and risked patient harm. Paediatricians decided to address this concern for their department and proposed to improve the quality of documentation by structuring their notes using subjective, objective, assessment and planning (SOAP) format. On observing only 13% compliance with SOAP use despite education and training to use it, a series of interventions were explored to increase its application.

Methods

Brainstorming sessions with the paediatricians provided practical solutions. These were tested one by one using plan–do–study–act cycles to understand their impact. Team feedback was pursued towards the end of each cycle to understand the opinion of each team member.

Interventions

Interventions included verbal reminders, individual feedback and SOAP acronym display. Each of these were tested singularly and serially. Acronym display proved successful until the arrival of COVID-19, which disrupted its implementation and redirected paediatricians' work priorities. This led to exploration of a new solution, and paediatricians recommended use of visual reminders at the handover site. Quantitative information was analysed to reject or retain the ideas.

Results

Verbal reminders and individual feedback made no difference to SOAP usage. Acronym display improved compliance from 13% to 90% but it fell to 45% during COVID-19. Its replacement with visual reminders during pandemic times reinstated the compliance to a median of 84%.

Conclusions

Selection of a change idea that respected front liner's constraints and suited local work environment proved valuable. Both acronym display and visual reminders served as visual reinforcements towards embracing a note format and proved effective. Perceived benefits from methodically written notes encouraged paediatricians to re-establish simpler measures to retain SOAP application, otherwise disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Patient related outcomes for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome recommendations for clinical trials and general urology practice [^ea3f94e6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

It is risky and likely an impossible proposition to recommend a single outcome instrument that can be employed successfully to describe and follow patients suffering from IC/BPS. The outcomes committee recommendations regarding outcome measures that should be considered in IC/BPS are outlined in Table 3. They were based on what the committee members believed were the most critical areas to be examined and then formulated by addressing PICO type questions.

4.1 Patient Related Outcomes (PROs)

It is recognized that PROs are the "holy grail" of outcome evaluation in clinical trials and clinical practice. While the committee were impressed with several of the IC/BPS PROMs presently available, we could not identify any correctly designed and validated PROs specific to IC/BPS. The Bladder Pain Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (BPIC‐SS) was developed using a methodology incorporating both qualitative and quantitative approach, while the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) modified from the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI) and has been shown to be responsive to change in an unreplicated post hoc analysis of a small treatment study. It should be our top priority to develop evidence‐based PROs in IC/BPS (or modify and/or validate existing PROMs). The PRO would follow a patient centered approach to comprehensively assess the impact of treatment. Once such a PRO has been validated and found to be reliable for clinical follow‐up it could be used for either a primary (or to complement a primary) or secondary outcome in a clinical trial. Such a PRO would prove invaluable for follow‐up in clinical practice. The development and validation of IC/BPS PROs is beyond the scope of our objective. We recommend that a mixed method study design based on both quantitative like interview, focused group discussion and qualitative approaches should be our next essential step in this field.

Intervention 4: visual prompter on team compliance with SOAP usage

PDSA 4

We discontinued writing the SOAP acronym in files and ran a fresh PDSA in August 2020 to test a new intervention. We displayed our initiative's performance (as a measure of percentage notes written under SOAP format) on the department information board placed at the huddle station using a chart display (online supplemental annexure 4). A coloured printout of our chart displaying the latest data was pinned on the information board every Wednesday. We also maintained a log of these updates. Paediatricians reported that well-articulated notes relayed information efficiently among doctors and nurses. In COVID-19 times when patient interaction time was stressed and group exchanges were suspended, comprehensive notes relayed enhanced communication and improved work efficiency. On noting an improvement of 72% towards use of the SOAP template, we retained this change idea.

Study of the interventions

Every intervention was tested individually, and outcomes were analysed over the corresponding time frame using quantitative data to help ascertain their impact. We noted dismal compliance with SOAP notes with the first two interventions, while the last two demonstrated a significant rise in SOAP application.

We observed no improvement on testing our first intervention (verbal team reminders) even though it was easy and simple to execute. While the team agreed to use the SOAP format after this intervention, they were often using it partially. Paediatricians then recommended that we provide specific component-based reminders, which led to our second intervention. This intervention led to a marginal improvement with some paediatricians finding this a criticism of their documentation efforts. We therefore discarded the first two interventions. Our third intervention (visual reminder in case sheets) led to a steeper rise in compliance from 19% to 52% in the month of October 2019. This improved further to 60% in November 2019. This change was appreciated by the team as it was a strong cue to use the format especially during busy shifts. Our maximum compliance reached 92% against a low case load and stayed close to 90% even during heavy caseloads.

Both our outcome and process measures plunged with the arrival of COVID-19. Further, ability to enter the acronym also suffered and implementation processes declined from 67% to 33%, resulting from reduced manpower and COVID-19 driven anxieties. This warranted a switch to our fourth intervention in August 2020, which demonstrated a rise in SOAP use from 72% to 91% in December 2020.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^3c557e5b]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — analgesic selection and titration: It is important that the patient understand that finding the medication or combination of medications that provide effective pain control requires a "trial and error" method of prescribing. The efficacy of each analgesic administered should be determined and only one drug should be titrated at a time; otherwise it is not possible to assess the effects of a certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals, guided by pain scores and side effects, and this requires frequent contact between the patient and the clinician. It is important for the patient and the prescribing clinician to understand that some side effects actually improve as the patient continues to take the drug for several weeks, and if these side effects are not intolerable, then the patient should be guided through this period. Patients and clinicians should be aware that 100% pain relief is often not achievable; the focus of pain management is to minimize discomfort and maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9b1102dd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^edb6fcbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

5 Summary

The outcomes committee of the IC/BPS Consensus Meeting believes that more effort must be made to develop and validate a better IC/BPS specific PRO, based on unbiased patient qualitative research methodology, to better delineate outcomes in this enigmatic and variable pain/urinary syndrome. At the present time, the only recommend primary outcome is the NRS/VAS pain scale and voiding diaries as reasonable primary endpoint outcome measures. These are crude outcome measures that do not consider the complexities of the condition, of patients' variable clinical phenotypes and/or patients' desires and expectations. The committee believes that the best available IC/BPS specific secondary PROMs include the patients' subjective assessment of outcomes (GRA) and composite scores of pain, urinary symptoms and impact/quality of life. Arguably the most accepted contemporary composite IC/BPS specific PROM is the NIH GUPI (the OS ICSI/PI can be used for trial comparisons), although further validation and reliability testing of other instruments may result in better and simpler assessment outcome tools. Researchers and physicians managing IC/BPS patients need to be aware and if appropriate, use generic PROMs that measure and describe pain, quality of life, sexual, and psychosocial parameters of this complex biopsychosocial condition. Until a validated PRO that reliably measures change over time is developed, the committee believes that the NIH GUPI or the PUF questionnaire provides reasonable clinical evaluation of patients in standard general practice. Above all, the committee strongly believes that more research is required to create better IC/BPS PRO‐based outcome measures.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^f814ecab]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^df08f009]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Interventions

In May 2019, we met all paediatricians and highlighted the concerns arising from unstructured ward-round notes, particularly the aspect of selective and variable patient information by different doctors compromising team communication and medicolegal integrity. We introduced the concept of structuring these notes using the SOAP format and shared information material on its methodology. The concept was appreciated by all, and many expressed familiarity with it from their training years. Following their agreement to use the format, training sessions were conducted to educate all consultants to implement it during rounds. All consultants were covered using serial training sessions by the end of the month. In the months of May 2019–July 2019, we evaluated our paediatric case files to learn our compliances with SOAP format (this constituted as our baseline). For this, we identified a senior consultant who audited all paediatric case records daily and ascertained whether information relayed in the ward-round notes matched the SOAP format and was relevant to each component of the acronym. However, we observed only a marginal compliance of 13% with SOAP use for these months.

Following this, we organised a brainstorming session where we sought their ideas on how to imbibe the practice in routine functioning. Our front liners put forth several reminder-based solutions which were tested using month-long plan–do–study–act (PDSA) cycles.

Intervention 1: verbal reminders to use SOAP format (August 2019)

PDSA 1

This change idea was tested with a PDSA cycle conducted throughout the month of August 2019. We selected 2 days of the week and on those days participated in departmental huddles to remind paediatricians to use SOAP format during their ward rounds. We maintained a calendar of these reminder meets, and our senior consultant audited all case files daily to identify the presence of SOAP format and also corroborate content under each of its components. We continued to observe only 13% use of SOAP format, reflecting no change from our baseline status. It was seen that while paediatricians increasingly wrote as per SOAP template, out of the four headings, they often missed one or the other. Paediatricians insisted that they require specific heading-based reminders.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: why a global patient registry is critically needed [^a854d08f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to establish expert consensus on the rationale for, and components of, a global patient registry for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our goal is to highlight what a comprehensive international patient registry can add to the growing body of IC/BPS-focused research and summarize the committee's rationale for inclusion or exclusion of certain patient and diagnostic characteristics to identify sub-groups of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy.

Materials and Methods

An expert working group was formed from members of the Global Consensus on IC/BPS meeting. The working group consisted of four Urologists and a Urogynaecologist, and held a series of meetings in 2025 to achieve consensus on the benefits, hurdles and practical aspects of developing a global registry for IC/BPS. Literature search of the PubMed database was also performed where relevant, and all members agreed on the final proposals.

Results

The framework for an IC/BPS global registry was developed inclusive of male and female patients ages 18 years and older, who have symptoms of pain, pressure or discomfort related to the bladder, along with lower urinary tract symptoms, that have persisted for 3 or more months, in the absence of confusable disorders. A comprehensive list of patient data points including demographic, history-related, and comorbid conditions was developed. Additionally, validated questionnaires were identified for inclusion that assess domains of pain, urinary symptoms and quality of life. Consensus was reached regarding collecting data on prior treatment, cystoscopy findings and biopsy results where applicable. Lastly, importance was placed on patient-reported questionnaire data that can be input longitudinally by patients to lessen the burden of data collection by providers. Technical, legal and financial aspects were addressed as potential barriers.

Conclusions

A global registry for IC/BPS would overcome the limitations of current regional registries by including large numbers of patients from varied geographical locations, allowing for more efficient recruitment of patients for clinical trials. Understanding epidemiological trends and global variation in practice would enable optimization of care and quality improvement worldwide.

Urinary tract infections in ADPKD — AUA/CUA/SUFU-aligned statements: The Work Group agrees that statements from the American Urological Association (AUA)/Canadian Urological Association (CUA)/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) for the general population apply to people with ADPKD, and notes this is not a formal endorsement and to refer to local guidelines where available. Recommendation 2.6.1 states clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Recommendation 2.6.2 states clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Recommendation 2.6.3 states clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Recommendation 2.6.4 states that, following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B). The text also notes that asymptomatic pyuria is relatively common in people with ADPKD and does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and that asymptomatic pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics (except during pregnancy), which is the same recommendation as that for the general population.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^16b6bc0f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^db61e36c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — evaluation and diagnostic accuracy in suspected recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI): A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge confers a 90% probability of UTI, defined in this report as > 10⁴ CFU/mL of a single uropathogen. In the same study, approximately 50% of women with one or more UTI symptoms (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, or back pain), who lacked that very specific combination of symptoms did not have cystitis, suggesting misdiagnosis of acute UTI is common. In-person assessment significantly improves UTI diagnostic accuracy; culture positivity rates for those tested following virtual assessment (29%) are less than half that for patients seen in person (64%). Given the number of conditions that share significant symptomatology with UTI and the common misdiagnosis of acute cystitis, patients with rUTI warrant evaluation with an examination at least at their initial presentation to rule out alternative explanations for the patient's relapsing symptoms and to identify any structural or functional abnormalities that may be contributing to infection recurrence, and additional examinations with subsequent infections are not required, particularly when presenting symptoms are consistent with prior episodes, but may be useful in situations where the patient's symptoms are atypical or fail to resolve with appropriate treatment.

### Management of bladder pain syndrome: green-top guideline no. 70 [^221176fa]. BJOG (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend to use a validated symptom score to assess baseline severity of BPS and response to treatment.

### EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain [^3379bb40]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to assess for non-bladder diseases associated with primary BPS.
