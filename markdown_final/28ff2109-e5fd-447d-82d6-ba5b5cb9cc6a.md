## Question

Riesgo de trombosis intrastent después de 6 meses implantado

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of stent thrombosis after 6 months of coronary stent implantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing definitions for stent thrombosis and where "after 6 months" fits. Then, I should verify contemporary incidence estimates for late and very late stent thrombosis. Next, I will examine patient- and procedure-related risk predictors. After that, I need to check how stent generation and antiplatelet therapy modify risk. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and monitoring advice, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the timing taxonomy so I don't mislabel the risk window. Stent thrombosis is classified by the Academic Research Consortium as acute within 24 hours, subacute from 24 hours to 30 days, late from 30 days to 1 year, and very late beyond 1 year; therefore, "after 6 months" spans late and very late categories, which carry distinct but overlapping mechanisms and risk profiles [^112jHZZP].

> Now, I should verify the contemporary incidence of late and very late stent thrombosis. Wait, let me double-check the most reliable estimates: in modern practice, overall stent thrombosis occurs in about 0.5% to 1.0% in the first year, with an ongoing risk thereafter of roughly 0.2% to 0.6% per year; importantly, very late events can occur beyond 1 year and are not negligible, which aligns with registry observations of late events accumulating over time [^112jHZZP] [^114AobEt].

> Hold on, I should verify whether second-generation drug-eluting stents changed this trajectory. The ESTROFA-2 registry reported cumulative definite/probable thrombosis around 1.3% to 1.4% at 1 year and 1.7% at 2 years with zotarolimus- and everolimus-eluting stents, suggesting a small but real ongoing accrual of events after the first year; this supports the notion that the risk does not drop to zero after 6 months, even with newer platforms [^114GJrzk].

> Next, I should review mechanistic and morphologic predictors that persist beyond 6 months. Let me consider OCT data: in patients imaged more than 6 months after DES, intrastent thrombus was identified in about 11.5% and correlated with smaller minimal lumen area and adverse neointimal phenotypes such as thin-cap fibroatheroma and heterogeneous neointima; interestingly, uncovered or malapposed struts were not more frequent in the thrombus group, suggesting that late events may reflect plaque biology and lumen compromise rather than incomplete healing alone [^117MTu7T].

> I need to ensure I capture patient- and procedure-level predictors that elevate late risk. Independent predictors of late stent thrombosis include prior STEMI presentation, stenting of the left anterior descending artery, longer total stent length, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure; bifurcation lesions also increase risk, and in some analyses zotarolimus-eluting stents in bifurcations carried higher thrombosis risk, underscoring the importance of lesion complexity and stent choice in select anatomies [^114AobEt] [^114GJrzk].

> But wait, what about antiplatelet therapy discontinuation, which is often the most modifiable driver. Premature cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy is the strongest predictor of stent thrombosis, with hazard ratios approaching 90 in observational cohorts; this effect size explains why guidelines emphasize completing at least 6 to 12 months of DAPT after DES, and why any consideration of early interruption requires careful multidisciplinary planning and documentation of risk [^112kdiUs] [^111w2CpX].

> Let me synthesize the quantitative risk for the period after 6 months. If the first-year risk is about 0.5% to 1.0% and the ongoing annual risk is roughly 0.2% to 0.6%, then from 6 to 12 months the incremental risk is on the order of 0.2% to 0.5%, and beyond 1 year the baseline risk remains approximately 0.2% to 0.6% per year, with higher risk in ACS presentations and lower risk in stable elective cases; this aligns with registry data showing cumulative 2-year risks near 1.7% and with guideline summaries of late risk [^112jHZZP] [^114GJrzk].

> I should double-check how stent generation and procedural technique influence this risk. Second-generation DES demonstrate improved arterial healing and lower thrombus burden on OCT compared with first-generation devices, and contemporary practice patterns with better deployment techniques have reduced, but not eliminated, late events; nonetheless, very late stent thrombosis remains a recognized complication even with modern platforms, reinforcing the need for adequate DAPT duration and vigilance for interruption [^117MTu7T] [^112jHZZP].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and monitoring. For most patients with DES, completing at least 6 to 12 months of DAPT is recommended, with individualized decisions thereafter balancing ischemic and bleeding risks; abrupt DAPT cessation should be avoided, and any planned interruption for surgery or bleeding should be coordinated with cardiology to mitigate thrombotic risk, given the high hazard associated with premature discontinuation [^111w2CpX] [^112kdiUs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ongoing annual risk was uniformly 0.5% to 1.0% after 6 months, but I should correct that: contemporary estimates place the ongoing annual risk closer to 0.2% to 0.6% on average, with higher rates in ACS and complex anatomy and lower in stable elective cases, so counseling should be individualized rather than assuming a single fixed rate [^112jHZZP] [^114GJrzk].

> Finally, I will translate this into practical advice. After 6 months, patients remain at a nontrivial risk of late or very late stent thrombosis, on the order of a few tenths of a percent per year, with higher risk in those with ACS presentation, long or bifurcation lesions, diabetes, renal dysfunction, or interrupted antiplatelet therapy; clinicians should reinforce adherence to DAPT, avoid unnecessary early discontinuation, and coordinate any required interruptions with procedural teams, while educating patients to seek prompt care for recurrent angina or acute symptoms that could herald stent thrombosis [^112jHZZP] [^112kdiUs] [^111w2CpX].

The risk of intrastent thrombosis after 6 months is **low but persistent**, with an incidence of 0.2–0.6% per year for very late stent thrombosis (VLST) [^112jHZZP] [^114GJrzk]. Risk is higher with **premature DAPT discontinuation** [^112kdiUs], complex lesions, long stents, diabetes, renal failure, and first-generation DES [^114AobEt] [^117MTu7T]. Second-generation DES and adherence to DAPT reduce risk, but VLST can occur even after 1 year, so **individualized DAPT duration** and close follow-up are essential [^111w2CpX] [^111DfXSF].

---

## Incidence of intrastent thrombosis after 6 months

Intra-stent thrombosis after 6 months is categorized as **late (> 30 days to 1 year) or very late (> 1 year)** [^112jHZZP]. Contemporary data show a persistent, albeit low, risk beyond 6 months:

- **Very late stent thrombosis (VLST)**: 0.2–0.6% per year after DES implantation [^112jHZZP] [^114GJrzk].
- **Cumulative incidence**: Approximately 2% at 3 years in a large DES registry [^114AobEt].
- **Second-generation DES**: Lower VLST rates than first-generation DES, but risk remains nonzero [^114GJrzk].

---

## Risk factors for intrastent thrombosis after 6 months

Several patient-, lesion-, and treatment-related factors influence **late and very late thrombosis**:

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) <br/> - Discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) [^112kdiUs] |
| Lesion-related | - Complex lesions (bifurcation, long lesions) <br/> - Multiple stents <br/> - Stent malapposition <br/> - Incomplete endothelialization [^114GJrzk] |
| Treatment-related | - Premature DAPT discontinuation <br/> - First-generation DES <br/> - Inadequate stent deployment [^112jHZZP] [^117MTu7T] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Intra-stent thrombosis after 6 months is associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**:

- **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**: Common presentation, often large and anterior [^112jHZZP].
- **Mortality**: High, with reported rates around 10–20% [^112jHZZP] [^114AobEt].
- **Recurrence**: Approximately 20% experience recurrent stent thrombosis within 2 years [^112jHZZP].

---

## Preventive strategies and management

Effective prevention and management require a **multifaceted approach**:

- **DAPT adherence**: Strict adherence to recommended DAPT duration (≥ 12 months) is critical [^notfound].
- **Second-generation DES**: Preferred due to lower VLST rates [^114GJrzk].
- **Individualized DAPT duration**: Based on ischemic and bleeding risk profiles [^111DfXSF] [^111w2CpX].
- **Management of acute events**: Prompt reperfusion therapy (PCI, thrombectomy) and intensive antiplatelet therapy are essential [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Incidence**: VLST occurs in 0.2–0.6% per year after DES implantation [^112jHZZP].
- **Risk factors**: Include diabetes, renal failure, complex lesions, and premature DAPT discontinuation [^114AobEt] [^112kdiUs].
- **Outcomes**: High morbidity and mortality, with significant recurrence risk [^112jHZZP] [^114AobEt].
- **Prevention**: Adherence to DAPT, use of second-generation DES, and individualized risk assessment are key [^111w2CpX] [^114GJrzk].

---

The risk of intrastent thrombosis after 6 months is **low but persistent**, with an annual incidence of 0.2–0.6% [^112jHZZP]. Risk is modulated by patient comorbidities, lesion complexity, and adherence to antiplatelet therapy [^114AobEt].

### Drug-eluting stent thrombosis: results from the multicenter Spanish registry ESTROFA (estudio ESpañol sobre TROmbosis de stents FArmacoactivos) [^114AobEt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the incidence, predictors, and outcome of drug-eluting stent(DES) thrombosis in real-world clinical practice.

Background

The DES thromboses in randomized trials could not be comparable to those observed in clinical practice, frequently including off-label indications.

Methods

We designed a large-scale, nonindustry-linked multicentered registry, with 20 centers in Spain. The participant centers provided follow-up data for their patients treated with DES, reporting a detailed standardized form in the event of any angiography-documented DES-associated thrombosis occurring.

Results

Of 23,500 patients treated with DES, definite stent thrombosis(ST) developed in 301: 24 acute, 125 subacute, and 152 late. Of the late, 62 occurred > 1 year(very late ST). The cumulative incidence was 2% at 3 years. Antiplatelet treatment had been discontinued in 95 cases(31.6%). No differences in incidences were found among stent types. Independent predictors for subacute ST analyzed in a subgroup of 14,120 cases were diabetes, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, stent length, and left anterior descending artery stenting, and for late ST were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, stenting in left anterior descending artery, and stent length. Mortality at 1-year follow-up was 16% and ST recurrence 4.6%. Older age, left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%, nonrestoration of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3, and additional stenting were independent predictors for mortality.

Conclusions

The cumulative incidence of ST after DES implantation was 2% at 3 years. No differences were found among stent types. Patient profiles differed between early and late ST. Short-term prognosis is poor, especially when restoration of normal flow fails.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) thrombosis in clinical practice.

Background

First-generation DES are associated with a significant incidence of late thrombosis. There is paucity of data regarding real practice late thrombosis incidence and predictors with second-generation DES, zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES), and everolimus-eluting stents (EES).

Methods

A prospective, large-scale, non-industry-linked multicenter registry was designed. Complete clinical-procedural data and systematic follow-up of all patients treated with these stents was reported in a dedicated registry supported by the Spanish Working Group on Interventional Cardiology.

Results

From 2005 to 2008, 4,768 patients were included in 34 centers: 2,549 treated with ZES, and 2,219 with EES. The cumulative incidence of definite/probable thrombosis for ZES was 1.3% at 1 year and 1.7% at 2 years and for EES 1.4% at 1 year and 1.7% at 2 years (p = 0.8). The increment of definite thrombosis between the first and second year was 0.2% and 0.25%, respectively. In a propensity score analysis, the incidence remained very similar. Ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95 to -0.99; p = 0.008), stent diameter (adjusted HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17to 0.81; p = 0.01) and bifurcations (adjusted HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.14 to 3.7; p = 0.02) emerged as independent predictors of thrombosis. In the subgroup of patients with bifurcations, the use of ZES was independently associated with a higher thrombosis rate (adjusted HR: 4; 95% CI: 1.1 to 13; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

In a real practice setting, the incidence of thrombosis at 2 years with ZES and EES was low and quite similar. The incidence of very late thrombosis resulted lower than was reported in registries of first-generation DES. In the subset of bifurcations, the use of ZES significantly increased the risk of thrombosis.

Estudio de eventos adversos (EA) relacionados con la transfusión después de que el producto ha salido al mercado

Se realizó en 6 instituciones un estudio retrospectivo a etiqueta abierta y no aleatorio de revisión de registros médicos a fin de demostrar que el índice global de EA relacionados con la transfusión en pacientes que reciben transfusiones de plaquetas con InterSol no fue mayor que el doble del índice observado en pacientes que recibieron plaquetas de aféresis almacenadas en plasma al 100% (plaquetas con plasma). El estudio clasificó las reacciones adversas a la transfusión según las definiciones descritas por "Biovigilance Component" del sistema "National Healthcare Safety Network" (NHSN). A todas las instituciones participantes se les exigió tener sistemas instalados para la observación de EA relacionados con la transfusión y para registrar cuando lo observado no era ningún EA relacionado con la transfusión. Un comité independiente de casos clínicos (CEC, Clinical Events Committee), sin ningún conocimiento del tipo de plaquetas y de la institución donde se realizó el estudio, se encargó de adjudicar los eventos registrados.

### Incidence and morphological predictors of intrastent coronary thrombus after drug-eluting stent implantation (from a multicenter registry) [^117MTu7T]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The mechanisms responsible for late and very late stent thrombosis remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and morphologic predictors of intrastent thrombus in patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation using optical coherence tomography (OCT). A total of 208 patients with 262 DES who underwent follow-up OCT examination > 6 months after DES implantation were included. The detailed vascular morphology including characteristics of neointima was analyzed. Thrombus was identified in 24 patients (11.5%) 11 months after DES implantation. Minimal lumen cross-sectional area was significantly smaller in the thrombus group than in the nonthrombus group (2.9 ± 1.7 vs 4.6 ± 2.0 mm(2); p < 0.001). No difference was found in the frequency of uncovered or malapposed struts between the 2 groups. Thin-cap fibroatheroma (20.6% vs 0.1%; p < 0.001) and heterogeneous neointima (22.2% vs 9.0%; p = 0.001) were more frequently detected in the thrombus group compared to the nonthrombus group. Second-generation DES showed lower incidence of thrombus, uncovered struts, and extrastent lumen compared with first-generation DES. In conclusion, the present OCT study revealed that smaller lumen cross-sectional area and neointimal morphology are important factors associated with intrastent thrombus. Second-generation DES demonstrated improved arterial healing and a lower incidence of intrastent thrombus compared with first-generation DES.

### XIII consenso SIBEN sobre traslado neonatal: establecer protocolos estructurados para el proceso del traslado neonatal podría mejorar los desenlaces [^1174SRj3]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

La centralización de los partos de alto riesgo en los hospitales con el más alto nivel de atención es fundamental para ampliar el margen de seguridad materno-neonatal y mejorar los desenlaces. Por lo tanto, es altamente recomendable trasladar oportunamente a las pacientes gestantes portadoras de embarazos de alto riesgo y/o con amenazas de parto pretérmino a centros de atención terciaria, sin embargo, no siempre es posible anticipar los riesgos antenatalmente, lo cual resulta en la necesidad de trasladar a neonatos en estado crítico. Lamentablemente, la movilización de los recién nacidos compromete aún más su estado de salud, especialmente en los países latinoamericanos. El presente trabajo resume los resultados del XIII Consenso Clínico de SIBEN de Traslado Neonatal, en el cual colaboraron 65 miembros de SIBEN, neonatólogos y licensiados en enfermería de 14 países de Iberoamérica, que participaron activamente durante el 2022, antes, durante y después de la reunión presencial que se llevó a cabo en Mérida, Yucatán, México el 12 de noviembre del 2022. En esta reunión se consensuaron las recomendaciones aquí vertidas.

### Surgeon-led improvement in compliance with use of sequential compression devices in a neurosurgery patient population [^112xJ9z1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Dispositivos de compresión secuencial (SCDs) o 'squeezy boots'

Primero se colocará durante su cirugía antes de irse a dormir.
Utilizado en pacientes posquirúrgicos/trauma debido al mayor riesgo de desarrollar coágulos de sangre.
Los SCD deben estar en su lugar mientras está en la cama, incluso cuando duerme, independientemente de la frecuencia con la que se levante y camine.
Incluso si es bastante activo en el hospital, su riesgo de desarrollar un coágulo de sangre aumenta, porque es probable que todavía no tenga su nivel de movilidad habitual (preoperatorio).
Puede quitar/reemplazar los urdimbres o desconectar/volver a conectar los tubos de los urdimbres al levantarse de la cama.
Pueden ser incómodos, pero son importantes para prevenir coágulos de sangre potencialmente mortales en las piernas.
No dude en pedir ayuda a su enfermera, asistente de atención al paciente, o médico.

The patient infographic was first distributed to preoperative patients by the surgical schedulers during their review with the patients regarding surgical scheduling logistics, and then daily to patients in the surgical stepdown unit by inpatient team members starting in July 2023. Active observations continued from July to August 2023. Significance in compliance percentages was calculated using the z-score test for two population proportions. The differences were deemed significant when the p value was less than 0.05.

### A RIETE registry analysis of recurrent thromboembolism and hemorrhage in patients with catheter-related thrombosis [^112EN5sq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have investigated the treatment and the outcomes of patients with catheter-related thrombosis (CRT).

Methods

The RIETE registry (Registro Informatizado de Enfermedad TromboEmbólica [Computerized Registry of Patients with Venous Thromboembolism]) is a prospective international registry of consecutive patients with objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE). We analyzed the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients with CRT.

Results

Of 558 patients with CRT, 45 (8%) presented with a pulmonary embolism (PE) concomitantly. More patients had central line-associated thrombosis compared with port systems, but catheter type did not influence the risk of presenting with a PE. Patients with only CRT were more often prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin for the duration of their anticoagulant treatment compared with patients presenting with concomitant PE. VTE recurrences and major bleeding events occurred frequently during treatment with anticoagulation (7 per 100 patient-years and 8.9 per 100 patient years, respectively). The rates of fatal PE recurrences (1.85 per 100 patient-years) and fatal bleeding (2.32 per 100 patient-years) were similar. Patients with an additional transient risk factor for VTE had the lowest risk for VTE recurrences (odds ratio [OR], 0.07; 90% confidence interval, 0.01–0.45) compared with patients with CRT and no additional transient risk factors. PE at presentation increased the risk of recurrent thrombosis by 2.4 times. Renal insufficiency was also an independent predictor of recurrent thrombosis (OR, 3.93; 90% CI, 2.0–7.7). The odds of recurrent thrombosis was decreased by 77% in patients who received anticoagulation therapy for > 90 days compared with patients with a shorter treatment (OR, 0.23; 90% CI, 0.1–0.56).

Conclusions

Concomitant PE occurs less frequently in CRT than lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but it is associated with a worse outcome. CRT occurs in high-risk patients, and duration of anticoagulation must be predicated on balancing these risks.

### Clinical predictors for fatal pulmonary embolism in 15, 520 patients with venous thromboembolism: findings from the registro informatizado de la enfermedad tromboEmbolica venosa (RIETE) registry [^117GsEaE]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical predictors for fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with venous thromboembolism have never been studied.

Methods and Results

Using data from the international prospective Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbolica venosa (RIETE) registry about patients with objectively confirmed symptomatic acute venous thromboembolism, we determined independent predictive factors for fatal PE. Between March 2001 and July 2006, 15 520 consecutive patients (mean age ± SD, 66.3 ± 16.9 years; 49.7% men) with acute venous thromboembolism were included. Symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis without symptomatic PE was observed in 58.0% (n = 9008) of patients, symptomatic nonmassive PE in 40.4% (n = 6264), and symptomatic massive PE in 1.6% (n = 248). At 3 months, the cumulative rates of overall mortality and fatal PE were 8.65% and 1.68%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, patients with symptomatic nonmassive PE at presentation exhibited a 5.42-fold higher risk of fatal PE compared with patients with deep-vein thrombosis without symptomatic PE (P < 0.001). The risk of fatal PE was multiplied by 17.5 in patients presenting with a symptomatic massive PE. Other clinical factors independently associated with an increased risk of fatal PE were immobilization for neurological disease, age > 75 years, and cancer.

Conclusions

PE remains a potentially fatal disease. The clinical predictors identified in the present study should be included in any clinical risk stratification scheme to optimally adapt the treatment of PE to the risk of the fatal outcome.

### Room for improvement: the impact of guideline-recommended extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery for colorectal and anal cancer at a tertiary referral center [^116jPyAK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism occurs in approximately 2% of patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery for cancers of the colon, rectum, and anus and is considered preventable. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons recommends extended prophylaxis in high-risk patients, but there is low adherence to the guidelines.

Objective

This study aims to analyze the impact of venous thromboembolism risk-guided prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective abdominal and pelvic surgeries for colorectal and anal cancers from 2016 to 2021.

Design

This was a retrospective analysis.

Setting

The study was conducted at a multisite tertiary referral academic health care system.

Patients

Patients who underwent elective abdominal or pelvic surgery for colon, rectal, or anal cancer.

Main Outcome Measures

Receipt of Caprini-guided venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, 90-day postoperative rate of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, and bleeding events.

Results

A total of 3504 patients underwent elective operations, of whom 2224 (63%) received appropriate thromboprophylaxis in the inpatient setting. In the postdischarged cohort of 2769 patients, only 2% received appropriate thromboprophylaxis and no thromboembolic events were observed. In the group receiving inappropriate thromboprophylaxis, at 90 days postdischarge, the deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism rates were 0.60%, 0.40%, and 0.88%, respectively. Postoperative bleeding was not different between the 2 groups.

Limitations

Limitations to our study include its retrospective nature, use of aggregated electronic medical records, and single health care system experience.

Conclusion

Most patients in our health care system undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancers of the colon, rectum, and anus were discharged without appropriate Caprini-guided venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Risk-guided prophylaxis was associated with decreased rates of inhospital and postdischarge venous thromboembolism without increased bleeding complications. See Video Abstract.

Margen De Mejora El Impacto De La Tromboprofilaxis Recomendada Por Las Directrices En Pacientes Sometidos A Ciruga Abdominal Por Cncer Colorrectal Y Anal En Un Centro De Referencia Terciario

ANTECEDENTES:El tromboembolismo venoso ocurre en aproximadamente el 2% de los pacientes sometidos a cirugía abdominal y pélvica por cánceres de colon, recto y ano, y se considera prevenible. La Sociedad Estadounidense de Cirujanos de Colon y Recto recomienda una profilaxis prolongada en pacientes de alto riesgo, pero el cumplimiento de las directrices es bajo.OBJETIVO:Este estudio tiene como objetivo analizar el impacto de la profilaxis guiada por el riesgo de tromboembolismo venoso (TEV) en pacientes sometidos a cirugías abdominales y pélvicas electivas por cáncer colorrectal y anal entre 2016 y 2021.DISEÑO:Este fue un análisis retrospectivo. AJUSTE:El estudio se llevó a cabo en un sistema de salud académico de referencia terciaria de múltiples sitios.PACIENTES:Pacientes sometidos a cirugía abdominal o pélvica electiva por cáncer de colon, recto o ano.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Recepción de profilaxis de tromboembolismo venoso guiada por Caprini, tasa postoperatoria de 90 días de trombosis venosa profunda, embolia pulmonar, tromboembolismo venoso y eventos de sangrado.RESULTADOS:Un total de 3.504 pacientes se sometieron a operaciones electivas, de los cuales 2.224 (63%) recibieron tromboprofilaxis adecuada en el ámbito hospitalario. En el cohorte de 2.769 pacientes después del alta, solo el 2% recibió tromboprofilaxis adecuada en la que no se observaron eventos tromboembólicos. En el grupo que recibió tromboprofilaxis inadecuada, a los 90 días después del alta, las tasas de trombosis venosa profunda, embolia pulmonar y tromboembolia venosa fueron del 0,60%, 0,40% y 0,88%, respectivamente. El sangrado posoperatorio no fue diferente entre los dos grupos.LIMITACIONES:Las limitaciones de nuestro estudio incluyen su naturaleza retrospectiva, el uso de registros médicos electrónicos agregados y la experiencia de un solo sistema de atención médica.CONCLUSIÓN:La mayoría de los pacientes en nuestro sistema de salud sometidos a cirugía abdominal o pélvica por cánceres de colon, recto y ano fueron dados de alta sin una profilaxis adecuada de TEV guiada por Caprini. La profilaxis guiada por el riesgo se asoció con menores tasas de tromboembolismo venoso hospitalario y dado de alta sin un aumento de las complicaciones de sangrado.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114k5zYg]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Fertility drugs and cancer guideline — methodological limitations in studying associations include inherently higher cancer risk in women who never conceived, risks from infertility-related factors (endometriosis and unopposed estrogens), the low incidence of most cancers, and that cancer diagnosis typically occurs years after fertility drug use. Based on available data, there appears to be no association between fertility medications and breast, colon, or cervical cancer, and there is no conclusive evidence that fertility medications increase uterine cancer risk, although women with infertility have a higher risk of uterine cancer. The guideline states there are insufficient data to comment on melanoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk associated with fertility drug use. Counseling is emphasized: "Se debe informar a las mujeres que puede haber un mayor riesgo de cánceres de ovario invasivos y limítrofes, y cáncer de tiroides asociado con el tratamiento de fertilidad", and it is difficult to determine whether this risk relates to underlying endometriosis, female infertility, or nulliparity.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^112tArYg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Definitions

Pocket haematoma was defined as palpable mass that protruded > 2 cm anterior to pulse generator. Pocket haematoma was evacuated if it caused tense swelling with poor capillary perfusion, progressive enlargement, or severe pain to the patient.

Any thrombo-embolic event that took place between OAC dosage modification and 45 days after the procedure was recorded. Arterial thrombo-embolic events were defined as ischaemic stroke, TIAs, or peripheral arterial thrombo-embolism. Venous thrombo-embolic events were defined as acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism or acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis. Prosthetic valve thrombosis was only ruled out based on clinical symptoms. Echocardiograms were not systematically obtained before and after the implant.

Surgical techniques

All procedures were performed in our centre by two experienced electrophysiologists and one fellow in electrophysiology (L.M. A.B. and J.M.T.). More than 500 devices are implanted each year, and each of the three physicians implants approximately one-third of them. The number of years of experience in implanting devices when the study started was as follows: L.M. 10 years; A.B. 6 years; and J.M.T. 1 year.

New implant

Implants were done according to our institutional protocol. After administration of prophylactic antibiotic and local anaesthesia, leads were implanted through subclavian vein (one puncture per lead) under fluoroscopic guidance. Most ventricular leads had passive fixation except in the cases of severe tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary hypertension. Atrial leads on pacemakers had passive fixation except in patients with previous cardiac surgery. In patients treated with cardiac resynchronization (CRT), all left ventricular leads were inserted though the coronary sinus. As a general rule, in our department, we follow the recommendation of current guidelines and abandon the implant of the CRT after 4 h or 60 min of X-ray, if the procedure is unsuccessful. Devices were placed in a subcutaneous pocket localized in the pre-pectoral region. After the procedure, a pressure dressing was applied to the wound for 6 h.

Replacement

After administration of the prophylactic antibiotic, an incision was made, the generator was exteriorized and disconnected, and then the leads were tested to confirm the correct sensing, pacing thresholds, and impedance parameters. The new generator was connected and inserted into the existing pocket, the wound was closed in layers, and a pressure dressing was applied for at least 6 h, or until bleeding stopped.

El enfoque incluye dos características adicionales que son algo flexibles en su implementación y ejecución:

(6) Participación de personas significativas: Al trabajar con niños y jóvenes, la participación de los padres y otras personas significativas es esencial para que se conviertan en colaboradores activos de la intervención. Al aprender cómo implementar el ADD y el descubrimiento guiado, los padres y personas significativas están capacitados para apoyar el uso de las características clave de la intervención en la vida cotidiana. Esto es crucial para la generalización y transferencia del aprendizaje más allá de las sesiones de terapia. Las personas significativas actúan como un puente entre la intervención terapéutica y la realidad diaria del niño las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana. (7) Formato intervención: El formato de la intervención se divide en fases principales. La fase 1 es la de preparación, la cual incluye el establecimiento de objetivos. La fase 2 es la de adquisición, la cual consta generalmente de 10 sesiones de intervención. En la primera sesión se enseña la estrategia global 'Objetivo‐Plan‐Acción‐Comprobación' (Goal–Plan–Do–Check en inglés), y en las sesiones 2 a 10 se fomenta que el niño utilice esta estrategia global, aprenda a realizar el ADD y descubra el uso de estrategias de dominio específico. La fase 3 es de cierre y reevaluación y corresponde a la última sesión, donde se revisan los objetivos y se evalúan los progresos logrados.

### Occult arterial bleeding associated with cardiac device implantation [^113MxmRQ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The appearance of hematomas or hemorrhages after the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIEDs) is a well-known early complication, which can be associated with reinterventions, infections, readmissions, and longer hospital stays. Occasionally, these bleedings may correspond to arterial hemorrhages, which require early identification and specific treatment. We reviewed two clinical cases of inadvertent arterial bleeding after Pacemaker implantation that required a high clinical suspicion together with a multidisciplinary evaluation of cardiologists, radiologists and interventional medicine that allowed a fast and effective endovascular approach.

### Abdominal surgical procedures in adult patients with cystic fibrosis: what are the risks? [^115hePyX]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

With advances in medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis are more commonly living into adulthood, yet there are limited data describing the need for GI surgery and its outcomes in adult cystic fibrosis patients.

OBJECTIVE:

We aim to use a national administrative database to evaluate trends in abdominal GI surgery and associated postoperative outcomes among adult cystic fibrosis patients.

DESIGN:

This was a national retrospective cohort study.

SETTING:

A national all-payor administrative database from 2000 to 2014 was used.

PATIENTS:

Patients included adults (age ≥ 18 years) with cystic fibrosis undergoing abdominal GI surgery.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

The primary outcome was trend over time in number of surgical admissions. Secondary outcomes included morbidity and mortality by procedure type.

RESULTS:

We identified 3075 admissions for abdominal surgery, of which 28% were elective. Major GI surgical procedures increased over the study period (p < 0.01), whereas appendectomy and cholecystectomy did not demonstrate a clear trend (p = 0.90). The most common procedure performed was cholecystectomy (n = 1280; 42%). The most common major surgery was segmental colectomy (n = 535; 18%). Obstruction was the most common surgical indication (n = 780; 26%). For major surgery, in-hospital mortality was 6%, morbidity was 37%, and mean length of stay was 15.9 days (SE 1.2).

LIMITATIONS:

The study is limited by a lack of granular physiological and clinical data within the administrative data source.

CONCLUSIONS:

Major surgical admissions for adult patients with cystic fibrosis are increasing, with the majority being nonelective. Major surgery is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and prolonged length of hospital stay. These findings may inform perioperative risk for adult patients with cystic fibrosis in need of GI surgery. See Video Abstract at.

PROCEDIMIENTOS QUIRÚRGICOS ABDOMINALES EN PACIENTES ADULTOS CON FIBROSIS QUÍSTICA: ¿CUÁLES SON LOS RIESGOS?

ANTECEDENTES:

Con los avances en la medicina, los pacientes con fibrosis quística viven más comúnmente hasta la edad adulta, pero hay datos escasos que describan la necesidad de cirugía gastrointestinal y sus resultados en pacientes adultos con fibrosis quística.

OBJETIVO:

Nuestro objetivo es utilizar una base de datos administrativa nacional para evaluar las tendencias en la cirugía gastrointestinal abdominal y los resultados posoperatorios asociados entre los pacientes adultos con fibrosis quística.

DISEÑO:

Estudio de cohorte retrospectivo nacional.

AJUSTE:

Base de datos administrativa nacional de todas las instituciones pagadoras desde 2000 a 2014.

PACIENTES:

Todos los pacientes adultos (edad > 18) con fibrosis quística sometidos a cirugía gastrointestinal abdominal.

PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:

El resultado primario fue la tendencia a lo largo del tiempo en el número de ingresos quirúrgicos. Los resultados secundarios incluyeron morbilidad y mortalidad por tipo de procedimiento.

RESULTADOS:

Identificamos 3.075 ingresos por cirugía abdominal de los cuales el 28% fueron electivos. Los procedimientos quirúrgicos gastrointestinales mayores aumentaron durante el período de estudio (p < 0,01) mientras que la apendicectomía y la colecistectomía no demostraron una tendencia clara (p = 0,90). El procedimiento realizado con mayor frecuencia fue la colecistectomía (n = 1.280; 42%). La cirugía mayor más común fue la colectomía segmentaria (n = 535; 18%). La obstrucción fue la indicación quirúrgica más común (n = 780; 26%). Para la cirugía mayor, la mortalidad hospitalaria fue del 6%, la morbilidad del 37% y la estadía media de 15,9 días (EE 1,2).

LIMITACIONES:

El estudio está limitado por la falta de datos clínicos y fisiológicos granulares dentro de la fuente de datos administrativos.

CONCLUSIONES:

Los ingresos quirúrgicos mayores de pacientes adultos con fibrosis quística están aumentando y la mayoría no son electivos. La cirugía mayor se asocia con una morbilidad y mortalidad significativas y una estancia hospitalaria prolongada. Estos hallazgos pueden informar el riesgo perioperatorio para pacientes adultos con fibrosis quística que necesitan cirugía gastrointestinal. Consulte Video Resumen en.

### Two-year follow-up intravascular ultrasound analysis after bare metal stent implantation in 120 lesions [^115uPNzn]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine long-term changes after bare metal stent implantation in a relatively large number of patients. There are few reports of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies performed on stented and nonstented (reference) segments beyond 6 months after bare metal stenting. Using IVUS, we evaluated serial changes in stented and reference segments between 6 and 24 months after stent implantation in 110 patients with 120 lesions. Serial IVUS images were acquired at five equidistant intrastent sites and at two different reference segment sites. Measurements were made of the external elastic membrane (EEM), stent, lumen, and intimal hyperplasia (IH = stent - lumen) area. For the whole patient group, between 6 and 24 months, the mean IH area in stented segments decreased from 2.6 ± 1.0 to 2.3 36 ± 0.9 mm2 (P < 0.001), and the mean lumen area increased from 6.2 ± 2.0 to 6.5 ± 1.9 mm2 (P < 0.001). The mean IH area decreased in 91 lesions (76%) and increased in 29 lesions (24%) between 6 and 24 months. There were no significant changes in EEM or lumen area in the reference segments. Late angiographic restenosis (diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) occurred in three lesions between 6 and 24 months. A late target lesion revascularization was performed for one lesion. In the period of time between 6 and 24 months after stenting, IH regression occurred in most (76%) stent lesions, resulting in late lumen increase. However, IH progression was observed in 24% of in-stent lesions. No significant changes of EEM or lumen area occurred in the reference segments.

Recomendación 3. Generalización y transferencia

La evidencia actual respalda la capacidad del enfoque CO‐OP para facilitar la adquisición de habilidades y su aplicación inmediata. Aunque la transferencia no se midió en todos los estudios, se ha demostrado que es uno de los elementos clave que diferencia al enfoque CO‐OP de otras intervenciones. Sugerimos el uso de un cuarto y posiblemente quinto objetivo para medir el efecto de la transferencia de la intervención a objetivos no entrenados.

El uso de análisis económicos de salud para captar los beneficios de la intervención más allá de los objetivos entrenados podría abordar una brecha significativa en el conocimiento para respaldar los servicios clínicos y la financiación de programas.

Además, se necesitan estudios longitudinales para examinar la sostenibilidad de estas habilidades a lo largo del tiempo y su transferibilidad a tareas no entrenadas y nuevos entornos. La evaluación de resultados a largo plazo ayudará a comprender el mantenimiento de las mejoras logradas con la intervención y si se justifican sesiones adicionales en el futuro.

WASID trial and risk predictors in intracranial atherosclerotic disease: In the WASID trial, patients were randomized to aspirin 1300 mg daily or warfarin, and warfarin was found to be associated with higher rates of adverse events (major hemorrhage, death) and not superior to aspirin. Patients at highest risk for recurrent ischemic events were those presenting early after their initial event (within 17 days of ischemic event) and patients with > 70% stenosis (18% risk of recurrent stroke at 1 year versus 7%–8% in patients with 50%–69% stenosis). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that patients with higher blood pressure had increased risk of ischemic stroke in the territory of the stenotic vessel in subgroups with both moderate (50%–69%) and severe (70%–99%) stenosis; elevated total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.0006) and elevated low-density lipoprotein > 100 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 1.7; P = 0.0326) were other predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke. Patients with 70% to 99% stenosis with more collaterals as graded on baseline angiograms had diminished risk of recurrent territorial stroke.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^116ufVzy]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

### Biliary drainage in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction: results of an Italian consensus conference [^114PwUuP]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

In particular, 4 studies report data regarding 6–8 vs 8–8 mm stents. Jacques et al. reported that, on univariate analysis, the use of 6 × 8 mm LAMS (OR 6.67; P = 0.04) was related to an increased technical success.

In a prospective study, the same authors enrolled 70 patients and recommend to use a 6–8 mm stent based on their long experience with this stent size, without direct comparison of the impact of stent size on procedural outcomes.

In the largest multicentric study present in literature including 256 patients, no statistically significant difference was observed between 6 and 8 mm and 8–8 mm stents in terms of technical success, clinical success, and stent patency (p = 0.661).

However, On et al. in a multicentric retrospective study including 120 patients reported that the overall technical success was similar between patients who had a 6–8 mm and an 8–8 mm stent, but adverse events (OR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.35–10.19; p = 0.008) and reintervention rates (OR, 6.17; 95% CI, 1.22–31.22; p = 0.019) were higher in those who had a 6–8 mm stent.

They were also interviewed every 6 months ± 3 weeks in person or via telephone by study personnel using a standardized script to ascertain bleeding events and ensure accurate recording of INR data. Participants were withdrawn and censored if they stopped taking anticoagulant agents, experienced a major bleeding event, were lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, or died.

Study outcome

The study outcome was major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, ie, overt bleeding that was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 20 g/L, required transfusion of ≥ 2 units of red blood cells or whole blood, occurred in a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intraarticular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and retroperitoneal), or was fatal. Death was attributed to bleeding if bleeding was the immediate cause of death or contributed to it. An independent adjudication committee, which was blinded to potential predictor data, assessed all suspected bleeding events and deaths by reviewing objective data including, but not limited to, transfusion records, surgical records, admitting diagnoses, imaging procedures, hemoglobin levels before and after the bleeding event, and clinical progress notes and interviews with next of kin in case of death.

Candidate predictor variables for new clinical prediction model

Candidate predictor variables were collected at enrollment and included demographic data, comorbidities, habits, concomitant medications, basic laboratory data, and genotyping for thrombophilia and genes influencing VKA metabolism (supplemental Table 3). Potential predictors were chosen based on previous literature and expert opinion. The time in the therapeutic INR range (2.0–3.0) was calculated according to Rosendaal's methodusing all available INR values. Labile INR was considered absent in patients taking DOACs.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke [^113qUWpd]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Intra-arterial thrombolysis is a maturing treatment for acute thromboembolic stroke that shows promise in restoring cerebral blood supply. Reviewed evidence suggests that intra-arterial treatment has a longer window for treatment than intravenous t-PA and does improve outcome. A favorable outcome is dependent on careful patient selection aimed at avoiding intracranial hemorrhage. This article describes features to evaluate for patient selection and highlights factors along the treatment algorithm to maximize success.

### Antiplatelet therapy in endovascular surgery: the RENDOVASC study [^117BdUGy]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet treatment prevents cardiovascular events and thrombosis during the endovascular surgery procedure. The aim of this study is to analyze the different antiplatelet treatment used in endovascular procedures in Spain.

Methods

In this investigation we included observational, retrospective, and multicenter study patients who underwent arterial endovascular therapy in 2006 or in the first 3 months of 2007, and follow-up of at least 1 year. The following data were collected: the usual epidemiologic variables, history of cardiovascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral artery disease), risk factors, endovascular procedure performed, blood pressure, ethiology of arterial disease, the pre-operative antiaggregant treatment, and antiplatelet therapy used at 1 month and 1 year after the procedure.

Results

A total of 1,557 patients were evaluated, of whom 84.3% were male. In addition 72.1% were hypertensive, 53.1% dyslipidemic, and 43.3% diabetic. From these patients, 32.6% presented with ischemic cardiomyopathy, 17.9% had a cerebral vascular history, and 35.3% had peripheral arterial disease. The most common etiology was occlusive disease (76.9%), the most commonly treated arterial sector was iliac (33.4%), and the most frequent procedure was stent angioplasty (46.9%). In the preoperative period, 75.1% of the patients were given antiplatelet therapy (89% simple antiplatelet treatment), 62.9% in the perioperative period, and 93.8% at 1 month after surgery (37.3% double antiaggregation). Antiplatelet treatment was administered previously to 86.2% of patients with history of cerebrovascular disease and to 88% of those with coronary disease. In the femoropopliteal sector 76.1% patients were receiving antiaggregation treatment before the procedure (11.1% double). However, 1 month later, double antiaggregation therapy was increased (45.3%), especially in the angioplasty and stent. In the iliac sector, 43.1% of patients with arterial stenosis and 38.2% of patients with complete arterial occlusion treated with angioplasty and stent continued receiving double antiaggregation 1 month after the procedure. In the carotid territory, 65.7% of patients treated with stent were receiving double antiplatelet treatment 1 month after the procedure.

Conclusions

We believe it is necessary to create consensus committees to perform clinical practice evidence-based guidelines to formalize antiaggregation treatment in endovascular procedures.

### Ureteral stents Do not increase the risk for acute kidney injury after colorectal surgery [^117EWpr4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureteral stents are thought to prevent or help identify ureteral injuries. Studies suggesting that ureteral stents increase the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury show inconsistent conclusions. The large ureteral stenting volume at our institution provided a unique opportunity for granular analysis not previously reported.

Objective

To determine whether prophylactic ureteral stenting at colorectal surgery increases acute kidney injury.

Design

Retrospective analysis of colorectal operations with prophylactic ureteral stents was compared to operations without stents. Adjusted analysis was performed with inverse probability treatment weighting.

Settings

Single institution enhanced recovery colorectal surgery service.

Patients

Prospective institutional database between July 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was acute kidney injury, defined as increase in creatinine ≥ 0. 3mg/dL (definition 1) and 1.5-fold increase in creatinine (definition 2) within 48 hours postoperatively.

Results

There were 410 patients in the study population: 310 patients in the stent group and 100 in the no-stent group. There were 8 operative ureteral injuries: 4 (1.29%) in the stent group and 4 (4.0%) in the no-stent group (p = 0.103). Unadjusted analysis revealed no significant difference in acute kidney injury between groups. After adjustment, there was still no significant difference in acute kidney injury between groups when defined as definition 1 (no-stent 23.76% vs stent 26.19%, p = 0.745) and as definition 2 (no-stent 15.86% vs stent 14.8%, p = 0.867). Subgroup analysis showed that lighted stents were associated with significantly more acute kidney injury than no-stent patients when defined as definition 1 (p = 0.017) but not when defined as definition 2 (p = 0.311).

Limitations

Single-institution results may not be generalizable.

Conclusion

Prophylactic ureteral stenting does not increase the risk of acute kidney injury for patients undergoing enhanced recovery colorectal surgery, although caution and further study may be warranted for lighted stents. Studies further examining contrasting roles of ureter stenting and imaging in open and minimally invasive colorectal surgery are warranted. See Video Abstract.

Los Stents Ureterales No Aumentan El Riesgo De Lesin Renal Aguda Despus De La Ciruga Colorectal

ANTECEDENTES:Se cree que los stents ureterales previenen o ayudan a identificar las lesiones ureterales. Los estudios que sugieren que los stents ureterales aumentan el riesgo de lesión renal aguda post operatoria muestran conclusiones contradictorias. El gran volumen de endoprótesis ureterales en nuestra institución brindó una oportunidad única para el análisis granular que no se informó anteriormente.OBJETIVO:Determinar si la colocación de stent ureteral profiláctico en cirugía colorrectal aumenta el daño renal agudo.DISEÑO:El análisis retrospectivo de operaciones colorrectales con stents ureterales profilácticos se comparó con operaciones sin stents. El análisis ajustado se realizó con ponderación de tratamiento de probabilidad inversa. AJUSTES:Cirugía colorrectal de recuperación mejorada de una sola instituciónPACIENTES:Base de datos institucional prospectiva entre el 01/07/2018 y el 31/12/2021.MEDIDA DE RESULTADO PRINCIPAL:El resultado primario fue la lesión renal aguda definida como un aumento en la creatinina ≥ 0,3mg/dL (Definición n.° 1) y un aumento de 1,5 veces en la creatinina (Definición n.° 2) dentro de las 48 horas posteriores a la operación.RESULTADOS:Hubo 410 pacientes en la población de estudio: 310 pacientes en el grupo Stent y 100 en el grupo No-Stent. Hubo 8 lesiones ureterales operatorias, 4 (1,29%) en el grupo Stent y 4 (4,0%) en el grupo No-Stent (p = 0,103). El análisis no ajustado no reveló diferencias significativas en la lesión renal aguda entre los grupos. Después del ajuste, todavía no hubo una diferencia significativa en la lesión renal aguda entre los grupos cuando se definió como Definición n.º 1 (sin stent 23,76% frente a stent 26,19%, p = 0,745) y por definición n.º 2 (sin stent 15,86% frente a stent 14,8%, p = 0,867). El análisis de sub grupos mostró que los stents iluminados se asociaron con una lesión renal aguda significativamente mayor que los pacientes sin stent cuando se definieron como Definición n.º 1 (p = 0,017), pero no cuando se los definió como Definición n.º 2 (p = 0,311).LIMITACIONES:Los resultados de una sola institución pueden no ser generalizables.CONCLUSIÓN:La colocación profiláctica de endoprótesis ureterales no aumenta el riesgo de lesión renal aguda en pacientes que se someten a cirugía colorrectal de recuperación mejorada, aunque es posible que se requiera precaución y estudios adicionales para las endoprótesis iluminadas. Se justifican estudios que examinen más a fondo las funciones contrastantes de la colocación de stents de uréter y las imágenes en la cirugía colorrectal abierta y mínimamente invasiva.

### Post-operative segmental cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: risk factors, clinical implications, and therapeutic considerations [^1165QhC5]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Besides to be a spontaneous event in several systemic conditions such as infection, malignancies, hematologic disorders, and trauma, cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST) can be also complications of neurosurgical interventions, especially in case of lesions or surgical approaches involving the dural sinuses with a reported incidence estimated between 5 and 12%.

CVSTs are generally reputed as severe complications because they represent potential life-threatening conditions. They are also considered very difficult to be managed, since the anticoagulant therapy, which is life-saving in these cases, can induce the hemorrhagic evolution of a CVST-related venous infarction.

However, post-surgical CVSTs frequently appear segmental and not progressive; therefore, apparently, they do not seem sharing the same natural history of the spontaneous forms, even though they can present similar pathophysiological mechanisms. In fact, postoperative CVSTs often remain clinically silent, and only a small percentage of patients become symptomatic depending on thrombosis extension and compensation effectiveness of the collateral venous drainage supply.

In this paper, we analyze our institutional series of patients undergoing supra- and sub-tentorial craniotomies for various intracranial pathologies and evaluated the factors, neuroradiological and clinical characteristics and outcome associated with the development of a postoperative CVST.

We present the case of a 52-year-old male with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction due to a spontaneous large left main thrombosis, without any angiographic evidence for coronary artery disease. After multiple unsuccessful attempts of thrombaspiration the large clot was mechanically retrieved by a flow restoration device that was primarily made for intracranial interventions. Intravascular ultrasound revealed marginal lumen narrowing after the intervention, but the final coronary angiogram showed a patent left main and there was no relevant stenosis remaining.

### Women connected to at risk Indian men who have sex with men: an unexplored network [^113wfGAg]. AIDS and Behavior (2015). Low credibility.

Little is known about the women connected to Indian MSM and their impact on HIV risk. We surveyed 240 Indian MSM, who identified their social networks (n = 7,092). Women (n = 1,321) comprised 16.7% of the network, with 94.7% representing non-sexual connections. MSM were classified as having low, moderate, or high female network proportion. MSM with moderate female network proportion (8–24% total network) had significantly lowered odds of HIV seropositivity (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.1–0.6). This suggests moderate proportions of female connections could mediate HIV risk. HIV prevention interventions in India could consider the greater involvement of women among their target audiences. Se sabe poco sobre las mujeres conectadas a HSH en India y su impacto en el riesgo de VIH. Se encuestó a 240 HSH indios, quienes identificaron sus redes sociales (n = 7,092). Las mujeres (n = 1,321) formaron al 16.7% de la red, del cual el 94.7% representa conexiones no sexuales. Los HSH se clasificaron como baja, moderada o alta proporción de red femenina. HSH con proporción moderada de red femenina (8–24% del red total) tuvieron un riesgo significativamente reducido de seropositividad de VIH (AOR = 0,24; IC 95% = 0,1–0,6). Esto sugiere que tener una proporción moderada de contactos femeninos podría atenuar el riesgo de VIH. Las intervenciones de prevención del VIH en India podrían considerar una mayor participación de las mujeres en su público objetivo.

### Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract for high transsphincteric fistula yields moderate results at best: is the tide turning? [^117FU1F3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract is a well-accepted and often used surgical procedure for perianal fistulas.

Objective

This study aims to confirm results of the ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract in a specialized colorectal center.

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study.

Setting

This study took place in a large colorectal surgical department with a tertiary referral center for perianal fistulas.

Patients

Consecutive patients were operated on with ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract for a transsphincteric perianal fistula between 2012 and December 2018.

Interventions

Patients underwent ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measured was the healing rate. The secondary outcomes measured were conversion into an intersphincteric perianal fistula, risk of recurrence, complications, and postoperative continence status.

Results

Forty-six patients were treated with a ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract procedure. All patients (100%) had preoperative imaging in their workup. Forty patients (87%) had a high transsphincteric fistula. The primary healing rate was a disappointing 17 of 46 patients (37%). The median time until failure was 4.2 months (interquartile range, 3.5–6.5). Of the failures, 16 converted to an intersphincteric fistula (55% of failures and 35% of all patients). The mean duration of follow-up in patients without a recurrence was 9.5 months (SD 11.9). Four patients (9%) were lost to follow-up. The mean Fecal Incontinence Severity Index postoperatively was only 2.35 (SD 5.7; range, 0–30). This resulted in 9 patients (20%) having a newly impaired continence status postoperatively. Continence impairment was mild in all these patients. The risk of developing a recurrence 1 year after surgery is 64.2% (95% CI, 49%-80%).

Limitations

This study was limited by its retrospective design and the small numbers with possible selection bias.

Conclusions

Results with the ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract procedure were not as good as hoped. The effect on fecal continence, however, was minimal. The procedure might be more suitable for low transsphincteric fistulas. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A992. LA LIGADURA DEL TRACTO DE LA FÍSTULA INTERESFINTÉRICA PARA UNA FÍSTULA TRANSESFINTÉRICA ALTA, PRODUCE RESULTADOS MODERADOS EN EL MEJOR DE LOS CASOS: ¿ESTÁ CAMBIANDO LA MAREA? La ligadura del tracto de la fístula interesfintérica es un procedimiento quirúrgico bien aceptado y de uso frecuente para las fístulas perianales.

Objetivo

Confirmar los resultados de la ligadura del tracto de la fístula interesfintérica en un centro colorrectal especializado. DISEÑO:: Estudio de cohorte retrospectivo.

Ajuste

Gran departamento de cirugía colorrectal y con centro de referencia terciaria para fístulas perianales.

Pacientes

Pacientes consecutivos operados con ligadura del tracto de la fístula interesfintérica para una fístula perianal transesfintérica, entre 2012 y diciembre de 2018.

Intervenciones

Ligadura del tracto de fístula interesfintérica.

Principales Medidas De Resultado

Tasa de cicatrización, resultados secundarios: conversión a una fístula perianal interesfintérica, riesgo de recurrencia, complicaciones y estado de continencia postoperatoria.

Resultados

Cuarenta y seis pacientes fueron tratados con una ligadura del tracto de la fístula interesfintérica. Todos los pacientes (100 por ciento) tenían imagenología en su preparación preoperatoria. Cuarenta pacientes (87 por ciento) tenían una fístula transesfintérica alta. La tasa de cicatrización primaria fue decepcionante en 17 de 46 pacientes (37 por ciento). El tiempo medio hasta el fracaso fue de 4.2 meses (rango intercuartil 3.5–6.5). De los fracasos, 16 se convirtieron en una fístula interesfintérica (55 por ciento de los fracasos y 35 por ciento de todos los pacientes). La duración media del seguimiento en pacientes sin recurrencia fue de 9.5 meses (desviación estándar de 11.9). Se perdieron durante el seguimiento a cuatro pacientes (9 por ciento). Después de la operación, el promedio del índice de severidad de incontinencia fecal fue de solo 2.35 (desviación estándar de 5.7, rango 0–30). Esto resultó en que 9 pacientes (20 por ciento) tuvieran una continencia deteriorada postoperatoria. El deterioro de la continencia fue leve en todos estos pacientes. El riesgo de desarrollar una recurrencia a un año después de la cirugía es del 64.2 por ciento (intervalo de confianza del 95 por ciento: 49–80 por ciento).

Limitaciones

Diseño retrospectivo, números pequeños con posible sesgo de selección.

Conclusiones

Los resultados del procedimiento con la ligadura del tracto de fístula interesfintérica no fueron tan buenos como se esperaba. El efecto sobre la continencia fecal, sin embargo, fue mínimo. El procedimiento podría ser más adecuado para las fístulas transesfintéricas bajas. Vea el Resumen del video en http://links.lww.com/DCR/A992.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on management of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis [^112jHZZP]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2023). High credibility.

Stent thrombosis (ST) — definition, incidence, outcomes, and classification are described: ST is an acute or subacute thrombotic occlusion that usually presents as an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; the overall incidence of ST is 0.5% to 1.0% in the first year and 0.2% to 0.6% in every subsequent year, with lower rates for elective stent placement (0.3%-0.5%) but higher in acute coronary syndrome (3.4%); in contemporary practice, the observed mortality rate (~30%) is high, although studies with systematic autopsy confirmation suggest that it may be < 10%; stent thrombosis is classified by the Academic Research Consortium criteria with timing acute, subacute, early, late, and very late, defined as within 24 hours (acute), 24 hours to 30 days (subacute), 30 days to 1 year (late), and > 1 year (very late), and early ST is defined as occurring within 30 days; approximately 20% of patients with a first ST experience a recurrent ST episode within 2 years; and premature or patient-initiated termination of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), sometimes because of bleeding or preoperative concerns, is responsible for most cases of ST.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

### Reproductive health after thoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^112K8s9z]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

LVAD in pregnancy — thrombosis risk and anticoagulation — entails higher pump thrombosis risk and an individualized strategy; guideline-derived points include that vitamin K antagonists are contraindicated in the first trimester with unfractionated heparin (UH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) used instead, in the second and third trimesters VKA or LMWH could be considered with monitoring of INR and anti-Xa levels (goal Factor Xa level 0.7–1.2 u/mL), and before planned delivery VKA should be discontinued in favor of UH which should be discontinued immediately before delivery; if first line UH is ineffective, thrombolytic therapy may be considered though thrombolysis carries a low rate of success and high risk of bleeding, and pump exchange may ultimately be required though there is no reported experience in pregnant patients.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy De-escalation strategies [^111DfXSF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of aspirin (ASA), and a P2Y 12 inhibitor, protects against stent thrombosis and new atherothrombotic events after a stent implantation or an acute coronary syndrome, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding. In most current practices, the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped at 6 to 12 months and ASA is continued indefinitely. The advent of safer stents, with less risk of stent thrombosis, has challenged this standard of care, however. A number of alternative strategies involving earlier de-escalation of the antiplatelet therapy have therefore been proposed. In these approaches, standard DAPT is switched to a less potent antithrombotic combination at an earlier time-point than recommended by guidelines. Three different de-escalation variations have been tested to date. The first one maintains DAPT but switches from the potent P2Y 12 inhibitors ticagrelor or prasugrel to either a lower dose or to clopidogrel, while maintaining ASA. The 2 other approaches involve changing DAPT to a single antiplatelet at some earlier time-point after the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, by stopping either the P2Y 12 inhibitor or ASA. These strategies have all demonstrated some benefit in clinical trials so far, but especially the contribution of ASA in secondary prevention is clearly evolving as its role in increasing bleeding complications while not providing increased ischemic benefit is becoming more and more clear. In contemporary practice, the type and duration of DAPT should now be based on an individualized decision, and the de-escalation strategies, if used wisely, can be added to the existing options.

### Epidemiology, endovascular treatment, and prognosis of cerebral venous thrombosis: US center study of 152 patients [^115dD4ud]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of CVT has grown in recent years with the conduct and publication of national and international multicenter studies including the ISCVT with 624 cases in 21 countries, 6 VENOPORT (Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Portuguese Collaborative Study Group) with 124 Portuguese patients over nearly 20 years, 13 and a US 10‐center study of 182 patients over 10 years. 14 These studies helped clarify the presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of CVT. The CVT literature, however, is dominated by small case series, case reports, and systematic reviews. Less than 2% of all publications include at least 40 patients with CVT. 15 Previously, the largest single‐center studies of CVT included 102 patients 16 and 106 patients 17 and, more recently, 26‐year follow‐up of 161 patients. 18

Our comprehensive stroke center (CSC) has a high volume of CVT, at nearly 20 cases annually, and an active interventional neuroradiology program that performs ≈150 neurointerventional cases annually. The purpose of this study is to examine the epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of CVT in a large cohort of 152 patients over 8 years, with a focus on our current experience with ET in 73 patients, representing one of the largest single‐center series to date.

The invention of intracoronary stents greatly increased the safety and applicability of percutaneous coronary interventions. At this time, > 1 million coronary stent implantations are performed each year in the United States. But together with the growing use of stents, stent thrombosis, the most feared complication after stent implantation, has emerged as an important entity to understand and prevent. Adjunct pharmacological therapy, stent design, and deployment technique have been adjusted ever since to reduce its occurrence. The current clinical overview of stent thrombosis ranges from its pathophysiology to current state-of-the-art technical and pharmacological recommendations to avoid this complication.

### Therapeutic strategies after coronary stenting in chronically anticoagulated patients: the MUSICA study [^111ugSbB]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the therapeutic regimens used at discharge in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) who undergo stenting percutaneous coronary intervention and stent implantation (PCI-S), and to assess the safety and efficacy associated with different therapeutic regimens according to thromboembolic risk.

Design

A prospective multicentre registry.

Setting

In hospital, after discharge and follow-up by telephone call.

Patients and Methods

405 patients (328 male/77 female; mean (SD) age 71 (9) years) receiving OAT who underwent PCI-S between November 2003 and June 2006 from nine catheterisation laboratories of tertiary care teaching hospitals in Spain and one in the United Kingdom were included.

Results

Three therapeutic regimens were identified at discharge: triple therapy (TT) — that is, any anticoagulant (AC) plus double antiplatelet therapy (DAT; 278 patients (68.6%); AC and a single antiplatelet (AC+AT; 46 (11.4%)) and DAT only (81 (20%)). At 6 months, patients receiving TT showed the greatest rate of bleeding events. No patients receiving DAT at low thromboembolic risk presented a bleeding event (14.8% receiving TT, 11.8% receiving AC+AT and 0% receiving DAT, p = 0.033) or cardiovascular event (6.7% receiving TT, 0% receiving AC+AT and 0% receiving DAT, p = 0.126). The combination of AC+AT showed the worst rate of adverse events in the whole cohort, especially in patients at moderate-high thromboembolic risk.

Conclusions

In patients receiving OAT, TT was the most commonly used regimen after PCI-S. DAT was associated with the lowest rate of bleeding events and a similar efficacy to TT in patients at low thromboembolic risk. TT should probably be restricted to patients at moderate-high thromboembolic risk.

### Percutaneous thrombectomy in patients with occlusions of the aortoiliac segment: a case series [^114XXcAF]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the risk of peripheral embolism did not increase with high thrombus burden (P = 0.74). However, the main factor in reducing the peripheral embolism rate in our study was optimal sizing of the dedicated large-diameter sheath to the diameter of the target vessel. Specially manufactured devices that can temporarily occlude the vessel, such as sheaths with a compliance balloon at the tip, could solve this problem and improve complication rates. Embolism occurred in two cases, although the sizing of the sheath was adequate in relation to the target vessel. Both the patients presented with a high degree of atheromatous atherosclerosis, and therefore, embolism may have already occurred during sheath placement before the thrombectomy manoeuvre. Nevertheless, the origin of embolism in these cases remains speculative.

### Late acute thrombosis after paclitaxel eluting stent implantation [^114NEqsA]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Late (more than six months) total occlusion after coronary stenting is a progressive phenomenon occurring in approximately 4% of patients, leading to acute myocardial infarction in less than 0.5%. The process must be related to severe and progressive intimal hyperplasia. In patients receiving coronary stenting with simultaneous brachytherapy, late total occlusion has been reported at a higher rate and to be related to stent thrombosis rather than intimal hyperplasia. Late total occlusion presenting with an acute clinical event seven months after the implantation of a paclitaxel drug eluting stent is reported. The occlusion developed soon after the interruption of ticlopidine treatment, suggesting that the event had a thrombotic genesis and that the risk is not confined to the first six month period.

### Thrombectomy in special populations: report of the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery standards and guidelines committee [^116w7k4w]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative cardiac procedures and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — incidence and timing are characterized by increasing risk with procedure complexity, where "the incidence of AIS in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was 1.7%, CABG and valve replacement 3.3%, and multiple valve replacements 6.7%". After transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), "the overall risk of AIS was highest in the early postoperative phase (0–90 days) but not in the later phase (90 days–5 years)", and early-phase anticoagulation was associated with "nearly half the incidence of cerebral ischemic events as non-anticoagulated patients (1.2% vs 2.4%)", although "the recommendation for prophylactic use of anticoagulants in these patients has yet to be determined". Regarding event timing around CABG, a large prospective study found "the timing of the event was intraoperative in 40% of patients and postoperative, with a peak at 40 hours after surgery, in 60%".

### Recurrence rates and risk factors in the altemeier procedure for rectal prolapse: a multicenter study [^111B4Doh]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Perineal proctosigmoidectomy (Altemeier) is a surgical procedure that is commonly used for the treatment of rectal prolapse. However, there is a diverse range of recurrence rates after Altemeier procedure repair that has been reported in the literature.

Objective

To identify primary and subsequent recurrence rates after perineal proctosigmoidectomy and to define potential risk factors for recurrence.

Design

Cohort study.

Settings

Conducted at 6 hospitals affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic.

Patients

The study included patients who were older than 18 years and were treated with the Altemeier procedure for rectal prolapse between 2007 and 2022.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were rates of primary and subsequent recurrences. Secondary outcomes included potential risk factors for recurrence previously mentioned in the literature.

Results

We identified 182 patients, of whom 95.1% were women, with a mean age of 79 years (SD 11.4). Overall, procedures were elective in 92.1% of patients, and 14.3% had previously undergone prolapse repairs (Delorme, Thiersch, abdominal suture rectopexy, and abdominal mesh rectopexy). At a mean follow-up period of 27.5 months (SD 45.7), 37.9% of patients experienced recurrence, with 16.5% of patients having multiple recurrences. A subsequent Altemeier procedure was performed in 72.5% of instances. Other treatments included Delorme, abdominal suture rectopexy, abdominal mesh rectopexy, or conservative management. This study identified connective tissue disorders and time since surgery as significant risk factors for recurrence.

Limitations

Retrospective design and varying follow-up periods.

Conclusions

Perineal proctosigmoidectomy is associated with a significant risk of recurrence. The risk of recurrence increased with the presence of a connective tissue disorder and in proportion to the elapsed time since surgery. These discoveries assist health care professionals in counseling and managing patients who undergo perineal proctosigmoidectomy for rectal prolapse. See Video Abstract.

### Ventral rectopexy: an international expert panel consensus and review of contemporary literature [^115Agk7p]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Ventral rectopexy has become increasingly used in the surgical management of rectal prolapse. There is a need for a contemporary evaluation of the role of the procedure and a description of its use in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE:

To create an international consensus on ventral rectopexy.

DESIGN:

An expert panel undertook a scoping review of the literature to identify subject domains of interest. Literature reviews were completed for each domain with subsequent development of evidence-based and practice-based statements. These statements were compiled and reviewed by the group over a total of 9 meetings. Once statements were confirmed, supportive text was finalized, and an anonymous vote was completed using Research Electronic Data Capture to record consensus.

SETTING:

An international expert panel comprising colorectal surgeons who perform ventral rectopexy in a high-volume center.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Statements and associated expert consensus.

RESULTS:

Eleven experts identified 10 domains for review: indications, contraindications, assessment and planning, consent, operative details, prostheses, complications, follow-up, recurrence and reoperative surgery, and specific considerations. After round table review, there were 17 resultant statements for consideration. Experts agreed unanimously with 13 of the statements and their accompanying text, with different experts disagreeing regarding the remaining 4 statements (91% consensus each).

LIMITATIONS:

Paucity of high-quality data.

CONCLUSIONS:

This international group developed 17 statements with high consensus. These statements provide an up-to-date summary of the literature, identify key areas for research development, and provide a reference point for colon and rectal surgeons who undertake ventral rectopexy as part of their practice. See Video Abstract.

Antithrombotic regimens after venous stent placement — outcomes are reported as follows. In-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis events were reported in 21% of patients, major bleeding events were noted in 7% of patients, and triple therapy reduced the odds of in-stent restenosis/stent thrombosis compared with dual antiplatelet therapy (OR, 0.7; p = 0.01). The primary and secondary cumulative patency rates at 12 mo were 70.0% and 92.4%, respectively, and no thrombotic adverse events or luminal obstructions due to in-stent restenosis were reported in either group; the presence of a hypercoagulable state, type IV obstruction, and type of anticoagulation used after stent placement were associated with early stent thrombosis.

### Thrombectomy within 8 hours after symptom onset in ischemic stroke [^117GzLWn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of thrombectomy for the treatment of stroke in a trial embedded within a population-based stroke reperfusion registry.

Methods

During a 2-year period at four centers in Catalonia, Spain, we randomly assigned 206 patients who could be treated within 8 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute ischemic stroke to receive either medical therapy (including intravenous alteplase when eligible) and endovascular therapy with the Solitaire stent retriever (thrombectomy group) or medical therapy alone (control group). All patients had confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion and the absence of a large infarct on neuroimaging. In all study patients, the use of alteplase either did not achieve revascularization or was contraindicated. The primary outcome was the severity of global disability at 90 days, as measured on the modified Rankin scale (ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Although the maximum planned sample size was 690, enrollment was halted early because of loss of equipoise after positive results for thrombectomy were reported from other similar trials.

Results

Thrombectomy reduced the severity of disability over the range of the modified Rankin scale (adjusted odds ratio for improvement of 1 point, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.8) and led to higher rates of functional independence (a score of 0 to 2) at 90 days (43.7% vs. 28.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0). At 90 days, the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 1.9% in both the thrombectomy group and the control group (P = 1.00), and rates of death were 18.4% and 15.5%, respectively (P = 0.60). Registry data indicated that only eight patients who met the eligibility criteria were treated outside the trial at participating hospitals.

Conclusions

Among patients with anterior circulation stroke who could be treated within 8 hours after symptom onset, stent retriever thrombectomy reduced the severity of post-stroke disability and increased the rate of functional independence.

### Do cost limitations of extended prophylaxis after surgery apply to ulcerative colitis patients? [^112Kc8D4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal surgery patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Extended prophylaxis for thromboembolism prevention has been used in colorectal surgery patients, but it has been criticized for its lack of cost-effectiveness. However, the cost-effectiveness of extended prophylaxis for postoperative ulcerative colitis patients may be unique.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of extended prophylaxis in postoperative ulcerative colitis patients.

Design

A decision analysis compared costs and benefits in postoperative ulcerative colitis patients with and without extended prophylaxis over a lifetime horizon.

Setting

Assumptions for decision analysis were identified from available literature for a typical ulcerative colitis patient's risk of thrombosis, age at surgery, type of thrombosis, prophylaxis risk reduction, bleeding complications, and mortality.

Main Outcome Measures

Costs ($) and benefits (quality-adjusted life year) reflected a societal perspective and were time-discounted at 3%. Costs and benefits were combined to produce the main outcome measure, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($ per quality-adjusted life year). Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis modeled uncertainty in probabilities, costs, and disutilities.

Results

Using reference parameters, the individual expected societal total cost of care was $957 without and $1775 with prophylaxis (not cost-effective; $257,280 per quality-adjusted life year). Preventing a single mortality with prophylaxis would cost $5 million (number needed to treat: 6134 individuals). Adjusting across a range of scenarios upheld these conclusions 77% of the time. With further sensitivity testing, venous thromboembolism cumulative risk (> 1.5%) and ePpx regimen pricing (< $299) were the 2 parameters most sensitive to uncertainty.

Limitations

Recommendations of decision analysis methodology are limited to group decision-making, not an individual risk profile.

Conclusion

Routine ePpx in postoperative ulcerative colitis patients is not cost-effective. This finding is sensitive to higher-than-average rates of venous thromboembolism and low-cost prophylaxis opportunities. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B818.

La prevención de una sola mortalidad con profilaxis costaría $5.0 millones (número necesario a tratar: 6.134 personas). El ajuste en una variedad de escenarios mantuvo estas conclusiones el 77% de las veces. Con más pruebas de sensibilidad, el riesgo acumulado de TEV (> 1,5%) y el precio del régimen de ePpx (< $299) fueron los dos parámetros más sensibles a la incertidumbre.LIMITACIONES:Las recomendaciones de la metodología de análisis de decisiones se limitan a la toma de decisiones en grupo, no a un perfil de riesgo individual.CONCLUSIÓN:La profilaxis extendida de rutina en pacientes posoperados con colitis ulcerosa no es rentable.

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^111nHAYx]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease and arrhythmias — antiplatelet therapy durations, risks, and consultation: Current guidelines recommend a minimum of 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for bare metal stents and 6–12 months of DAPT for drug-eluting stents, with 12 months of DAPT for patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy was the most important predictor of stent thrombosis (hazard ratio, 89.78; 95% CI, 29.90–269.60; P < .001) in a prospective observation cohort study of 2,229 patients and can be associated with a 6% risk of periprocedural stent thrombosis and a 9% mortality rate for periprocedural myocardial infarction secondary to stent thrombosis. Particularly if the stent implantation or cardiac event occurred within 1 year, it is recommended that a cardiology or vascular or internal medicine consultation be obtained for patients being considered for procedures that require discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, and that a discussion of the risks with the patient be documented in the medical record.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum guidelines — quality-of-evidence definitions are specified as follows: Grade A, or high-quality evidence, usually comes from well-executed randomized trials yielding consistent results, and occasionally, observational studies with large effects. Grade B, or moderate-quality evidence, comes from randomized clinical trials with important limitations, inconsistent randomized trials, and strong observational studies. Grade C, or low-quality evidence, includes flawed randomized trials and most observational studies as well as data from case reports, descriptive studies, and expert opinion.

### Obturator bypass remains a useful option [^1137nwr7]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The femoral tripod remains technically crucial in vascular surgery, as well for an elective revascularization as for an extensive approach to the arterial tree. The management of septic complications and healing disorders in this area is really challenging. Obturator bypass (OB) represents an alternative sometimes employed in this context, but few recent series were recently published. The objectives of this work were thus to evaluate the results of OB in terms of patency, morbi-mortality, healing evolution and absence of reinfection.

Methods

This was a monocentric retrospective study including all the patients treated by OB, whatever the cause, between January 2010 and December 2020. Primary outcomes were the primary and the secondary patencies. The secondary outcomes were the morbi-mortality, freedom from infection and healing.

Results

During this period, 23 OBs were carried out in 22 patients, with a majority of men (77%) whose median age was 70 years [34–87]. The indications were infection in 19 patients (86%), and iterative thrombosis in 3 patients (14%). The substitute was an arterial allograft in 82% of the cases, and the outflow was the deep femoral artery only in 14% of the cases. The median operative time was 224 min [111–391] and median blood losses were 900 mL [300–3,900]. We observed 7 systemic (32%), and 8 local complications (36%). Healing was obtained in 90% of the cases, and freedom from infection was obtained in 100% of the cases. The median duration of follow-up was 594 days [5–2,517]. One-year, 2-year and 3-year primary patency rates were 84%, 78%, and 63%, respectively. One-year, 2-year and 3-year secondary patencies were 94%, 94%, and 80%, respectively. One-month, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year survival rates were 86%, 73%, 67%, and 53%, respectively.

Conclusions

Our study showed that the OB represents a relevant alternative in the event of complex lesions of the femoral tripod, with good patency and healing rates and good infection control. On the other hand, its consequences in terms of morbi-mortality confirm that OB is a major surgery that should be used when a traditional approach is not possible.

### Randomized comparison of ticlopidine and clopidogrel after intracoronary stent implantation in a broad patient population [^111gdsUT]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although clopidogrel is used to prevent subacute stent thrombosis, its safety and efficacy have not been compared with ticlopidine in a randomized manner in the United States.

Methods and Results

Patients with successful intracoronary stent implantation were randomly assigned to therapy with ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Loading doses were administered immediately after the procedure, and the drugs were prescribed for 2 weeks. One thousand sixteen patients were enrolled: 522 patients were randomly assigned to ticlopidine therapy and 494 to clopidogrel. High-risk characteristics included recent myocardial infarction in 41.4% of the cases, angiographically evident thrombus in 20.9%, and abrupt or threatened closure in 3.64%. An intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was used in 48.2% of the cases, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 1.43% of these patients. Failure to complete 2 weeks of therapy occurred in 3.64% of the patients treated with ticlopidine and in 1.62% of the patients treated with clopidogrel (P = 0.043). Within 30 days, thrombosis of the stent occurred in 1.92% of the patients in the ticlopidine group and in 2.02% of the clopidogrel group (P = 0.901). A major adverse cardiac event occurred in 4.60% of patients receiving ticlopidine and in 3.85% of patients receiving clopidogrel (P = 0.551).

Conclusions

Clopidogrel is better tolerated than ticlopidine during a 2-week regimen after intracoronary stent implantation. Combining either thienopyridine with an intravenous platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitor appears to be safe. When applied to a broad spectrum of patients receiving stent implantation, clopidogrel confers similar protection as ticlopidine against subacute stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac events.

### Effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy in the treatment of post-TAVI bioprosthetic thrombosis [^113w7iyf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

We report herein the case of an 82-year-old patient with a respective history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), type 2 diabetes, treated dyslipidemia and chronic ischemic heart disease (CD Angioplasty, AIV), recent disabling stroke, Parkinson's disease, angina pectoris and dyspnea on exertion (NYHA 3). The patient was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis: annulus = 23 mm, area = 0.85 cm 2, minimal aortic insufficiency (AI), transvalvular mean gradient (MG) = 30 mmHg, with consistent LVEF at 55% in transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at 50 mmHg and coronary lesions for which the patient received a stent in the middle segment of the right coronary artery prior to the procedure. EUROSCORE was 26% while STS score was 2.39% risk of mortality and 14.73% risk of morbidity or mortality.

The patient was implanted with a 26 mm Edwards-Sapien XT Valve via left femoral access without complications.

Echocardiographic control at post-procedure and at one month revealed an aortic valve area of 1.9 cm 2, MG = 9 mmHg, with the patient showing clinical improvement.

The patient was re-admitted 5 months after the procedure for syncope and recurrent angina; upon TTE examination: LVEF = 55%, valve area = 0.8 cm 2, MG = 56 mmHg.

The non-displaced bioprosthesis presented cusps with reduced mobility in the apical portion, with a predominant obstruction distally to the valve with visible thrombus. Of note, the patient had been under dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) since his discharge.

At this point, the diagnosis of prosthetic valvular thrombosis was evoked.

Upon medico-surgical consensus, it was decided to introduce heparin therapy relayed by VKA treatment (oral anticoagulants).

En comparación con los pacientes que tomaron clopidogrel durante 12 meses, los que fueron tratados con este fármaco durante 30 meses presentaron índices menores de ataques cardíacos y trombosis en el estent, pero tasas más altas de muerte, principalmente a causa de cáncer o traumatismos. Después de implantado el estent, los pacientes recibieron una doble terapia antiagregante plaquetaria a base de aspirina y clopidogrel o prasugrel por 12 meses, y luego se les seleccionó al azar para continuar el tratamiento por otros 18 meses con la doble terapia antiagregante plaquetaria o con aspirina y un placebo. El ensayo de DTAP mostró que la terapia antiagregante plaquetaria con clopidogrel o con prasugrel extendida a 30 meses redujo el riesgo de sufrir una trombosis en el estent y ataques al corazón, pero aumentó el de sangrado y el riesgo general de muerte, en comparación con el grupo a 12 meses.

Los análisis del tiempo transcurrido hasta la aparición del primer caso de cáncer como un efecto adverso arrojaron un cociente de riesgo de 1. 06, con un IC del 95%, para todos los casos de cáncer, y de
0. 95, con un IC del 95%, para los casos nuevos.

### Historias verdaderas de personas con trombosis venosa profunda… [^1122kzUC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Pensé que estaba relacionado con el hecho de haber dado a luz y por eso no hice nada, hasta que al día siguiente se me hinchó muchísimo la pierna. En ese momento me fui al hospital, donde me diagnosticaron un coágulo de sangre en la pierna izquierda, tras hacerme un estudio Doppler. Me empezaron a dar anticoagulantes y estuve hospitalizada por 8 días. Después de seis meses de estar tomando un anticoagulante, mi vida volvió a la normalidad. Si bien la parte baja de mi pierna izquierda siguió estando un poco más grande que la derecha, continué haciendo deporte e inclusive jugué al baloncesto en la universidad. Después del nacimiento de mi primer hijo me recetaron píldoras anticonceptivas. Por suerte, después de un mes de tomarlas, leí la información impresa en letra chiquita en el envase y me di cuenta de que podían aumentar el riesgo de tener otro coágulo. Dejé de tomarlas inmediatamente.

Para el 2010 mi actividad física había disminuido. Ya no estaba tan activa como antes y aumenté de peso. Comencé a participar en un programa intensivo de ejercicios. Me hospitalizaron por cinco o seis días y tuve que pedir un mes de licencia en el trabajo para recuperarme. Fui a ver a un hematólogo y me recetó un régimen continuo de anticoagulantes. Ahora tengo el sindrome postrombótico, que me causa edema en la pierna. La opinión de los médicos fue que mi coágulo se formó por usar anticonceptivos, combinado con el hecho de pasar mucho tiempo sentada, ya que ambos factores pueden aumentar el riesgo de que se formen coágulos. Me sentí enojada, pues no estaba totalmente consciente de los riesgos de los anticonceptivos.

Cuando quedé embarazada de mi hijo, mi riesgo de que se formasen coágulos de sangre fue alto debido a que los niveles de estrógeno aumentan durante el embarazo, y tuve que tomar heparina todos los días para evitar que se formase otro coágulo. Hacia el final del embarazo, tuve que inyectarme heparina dos veces por día.

### Coágulos sanguíneos (trombosis venosa profunda) [^116Puh5c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

¿Qué aumenta el riesgo de presentar trombosis venosa profunda. Algunas cosas pueden aumentar el riesgo de que se forme un coágulo de sangre en una vena profunda. Para los pacientes con cáncer, los factores de riesgo más comunes son:

- Lesión en una vena durante una operación mayor.
- Circulación lenta de la sangre. Esto puede suceder por estar en cama por mucho tiempo.
- Tener un catéter en una vena central. Tanto como la mitad de los pacientes con cáncer que tienen un catéter colocado en una vena central para recibir quimioterapia a largo plazo pueden presentar trombosis venosa profunda.
- Envejecer.
- La obesidad. ¿Qué problemas de salud puede causar la trombosis venosa profunda. Embolia pulmonar Se puede desplazar un pedazo de coágulo de sangre por el torrente sanguíneo y llegar a los pulmones. Esto se conoce como embolia pulmonar. Las personas se pueden recuperar de esto si el coágulo es pequeño y reciben el tratamiento adecuado.

Pero si el coágulo es grande, puede impedir que la sangre llegue a los pulmones y causar la muerte. Esta es la causa principal de muerte en las personas con cáncer, después del cáncer mismo. Las embolias pulmonares pueden causar:

- Dificultad para respirar.
- Latido cardiaco acelerado o irregular.
- Dolor de pecho que suele empeorar al toser o respirar hondo.
- Toser con sangre.
- Presión arterial baja, mareos o desmayos. Si tiene alguno de estos síntomas, llame a su médico de inmediato. Se puede usar una prueba llamada tomografía computarizada para encontrar una embolia pulmonar. Tanto como la mitad de las embolias pulmonares en los pacientes con cáncer se detectan de esta manera. Busque atención médica de inmediato si sufre de alguno de estos síntomas en su pulmón: Síndrome postrombótico Cerca de una tercera parte de las personas con trombosis venosa profunda tendrán problemas de salud de larga duración. Esto se llama síndrome postrombótico.

Este síndrome puede causar hinchazón, dolor, oscurecimiento o enrojecimiento de la piel y otros problemas. Hace que la piel sea propensa a infecciones, que pueden propagarse al torrente sanguíneo y causar septicemia y la muerte.
