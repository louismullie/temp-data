## Question

Diagnosing PCOS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic framework and which guideline to anchor to. Then, I should verify the core diagnostic criteria for adults and how they differ from adolescents. Next, I will examine the role of ultrasound versus AMH and when each is indicated. After that, I need to check the mandatory exclusion of mimicking conditions and the specific tests required. I will then consider special populations such as adolescents, perimenopausal women, and those with obesity. Finally, I should review phenotypes, documentation, and a practical diagnostic algorithm, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current evidence-based guidance [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS is the most authoritative, building on the 2018 guideline and the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, and it provides a unified, stepwise approach to diagnosis across the reproductive lifespan; I should anchor to this framework to ensure consistency and avoid outdated or fragmented criteria [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

> I will now examine the adult diagnostic criteria. In reproductive-aged women, PCOS is diagnosed when at least two of the following three features are present after excluding other etiologies: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound; importantly, if both irregular cycles and clinical hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound or AMH testing is not required to confirm the diagnosis, which simplifies care in classic presentations [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

> Wait, let me verify the role of AMH. The 2023 update introduces AMH as an alternative to ultrasound for indicating polycystic ovarian morphology in adults; AMH reflects the antral follicle pool and is convenient and noninvasive, but thresholds vary by assay and population, and AMH should not be used in adolescents because physiologic pubertal AMH elevation undermines specificity, so I need to ensure I apply AMH only in adults and interpret results with assay-specific context [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^e0bd102c].

> Next, I should review adolescent-specific criteria. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and neither ultrasound nor AMH should be used for diagnosis due to poor specificity; irregular cycles must be defined carefully by time since menarche, and persistent oligomenorrhea beyond two years post-menarche is particularly informative, so I should double-check cycle definitions and avoid overdiagnosis from normal pubertal physiology [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^c467c9cc].

> Hold on, I should verify the exclusion of other etiologies. Before labeling PCOS, I must exclude conditions that mimic its features: measure TSH for thyroid disease, prolactin for hyperprolactinemia, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone for nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia; in selected cases, consider Cushing syndrome, androgen-secreting tumors, or syndromes of severe insulin resistance, because missing these can alter management and prognosis [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^4357145c].

> Let me consider special populations. In perimenopausal or menopausal women, a presumptive diagnosis can be made from a well-documented history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during reproductive years, with ultrasound less likely to show polycystic morphology; in women with obesity, I should maintain the same diagnostic criteria but be mindful that obesity amplifies metabolic risks and can confound androgen assays, so I need to ensure accurate testing and counsel on weight management [^f67f69fc] [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

> I should confirm the phenotypic classification. The Rotterdam framework generates four phenotypes: A (hyperandrogenism plus ovulatory dysfunction plus PCOM), B (hyperandrogenism plus ovulatory dysfunction), C (hyperandrogenism plus PCOM), and D (ovulatory dysfunction plus PCOM); documenting the phenotype helps anticipate metabolic and reproductive risks and guides individualized management, so I need to record which two criteria were used to make the diagnosis [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

> Next, I should review the practical diagnostic algorithm. If irregular cycles and clinical hyperandrogenism are both present, diagnosis is made after excluding mimics and no ultrasound or AMH is needed; if only one feature is present, I should test for biochemical hyperandrogenism or assess ovarian morphology with ultrasound or AMH to find a second feature; if neither cycles nor hyperandrogenism are present, PCOS is not diagnosed and alternative explanations should be pursued, which prevents overdiagnosis and ensures parsimony [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^658e69c0].

> But wait, what if I am relying on biochemical hyperandrogenism alone. I need to ensure I use the right assays and interpret them correctly: free testosterone is more sensitive than total testosterone, and I should prefer methods like equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone when available; I should also remember that oral contraceptives can suppress androgens and confound testing, so timing and context matter for accuracy [^c76aefe5] [^119aa810].

> I should double-check documentation and follow-up. I need to record which two diagnostic features were used, the results of exclusion testing, and the assigned phenotype; for adolescents who meet only one criterion, I should label them as "at risk", provide anticipatory guidance, and plan reassessment, because early identification and lifestyle intervention can mitigate long-term metabolic complications [^119aa810] [^83d6512b] [^b3756a86].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis is anchored to the 2023 International Guideline: in adults, two of three features after exclusion of mimics, with AMH now an acceptable alternative to ultrasound for PCOM; in adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required and neither ultrasound nor AMH should be used; throughout, I must exclude thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassical CAH, and tailor evaluation to special populations and phenotype to guide care and counseling [^119aa810] [^83d6512b].

Diagnose PCOS in adults by confirming **two of three** — hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology — after excluding other causes [^119aa810]. In adolescents, **both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction** are required; ultrasound or AMH are not used for diagnosis [^119aa810]. Always exclude thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassical CAH with TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP [^4357145c]. AMH can substitute for ultrasound in adults, but **not in adolescents** [^119aa810]. Use the Rotterdam-based international criteria to classify phenotypes and guide management [^83d6512b].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

### Adult women (reproductive age)

The 2023 international guideline recommends the **Rotterdam-based criteria**, requiring two of the following after excluding other causes:

- **Hyperandrogenism**: clinical (hirsutism, acne, alopecia) or biochemical (elevated free/bioavailable testosterone) [^119aa810].
- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea or biochemical anovulation [^119aa810].
- **Polycystic ovarian morphology**: ultrasound (≥ 12 follicles 2–9 mm or ovarian volume > 10 mL) or elevated AMH [^119aa810].

If both irregular cycles and clinical hyperandrogenism are present, **ultrasound or AMH is not required** [^119aa810].

---

### Adolescents

Diagnosis requires **both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction**, with strict cycle definitions by time since menarche [^c467c9cc]. Ultrasound and AMH are **not recommended** due to poor specificity in puberty [^119aa810].

---

## Exclusion of other conditions

Before diagnosing PCOS, **exclude**:

- **Thyroid disease**: TSH [^4357145c].
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: prolactin [^4357145c].
- **Nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: 17-OHP [^4357145c].
- **Other causes**: Cushing's, androgen-secreting tumors, severe insulin resistance syndromes as indicated [^5cb90876].

---

## Role of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)

AMH is a **validated alternative to ultrasound** for polycystic ovarian morphology in adults, with age-specific thresholds and assay standardization improving accuracy [^119aa810]. It is **not recommended for adolescent diagnosis** because of physiologic elevation in puberty [^119aa810].

---

## Phenotypic classification

The Rotterdam framework defines **four phenotypes**; documenting the phenotype supports risk stratification and management:

| **Phenotype** | **Features** |
|-|-|
| A | Hyperandrogenism + ovulatory dysfunction + PCOM |
| B | Hyperandrogenism + ovulatory dysfunction |
| C | Hyperandrogenism + PCOM |
| D | Ovulatory dysfunction + PCOM |

---

## Diagnostic challenges and controversies

- **Heterogeneity**: Clinical features vary widely, complicating diagnosis [^d94d4232].
- **Adolescent overlap**: Pubertal physiology can mimic PCOS, risking overdiagnosis [^92fdaf8a].
- **Ethnic variation**: Prevalence and phenotype differ by ancestry, requiring culturally sensitive criteria [^3027632b].
- **Evidence quality**: Much of the evidence base is low to moderate; ongoing research is needed [^847511ee].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or incorrect diagnosis

Delayed or incorrect diagnosis can lead to **increased metabolic risk** — obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^c821658a] — as well as reproductive complications such as infertility, endometrial hyperplasia, and pregnancy complications [^751141be]. Psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life, are also common [^e1f15f18].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

- **Step 1**: Identify two of three features (hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, PCOM/elevated AMH) after excluding other causes [^119aa810].
- **Step 2**: In adolescents, require both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction; do not use ultrasound or AMH [^119aa810].
- **Step 3**: Classify phenotype to guide management and counseling [^83d6512b].

---

PCOS diagnosis relies on the **Rotterdam-based international criteria**, adapted for age and evidence, with mandatory exclusion of mimics and judicious use of AMH in adults. This approach balances accuracy, simplicity, and patient-centered care.

### Controversy in clinical endocrinology: diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome: in defense of the rotterdam criteria [^d54ba5e5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common endocrinopathy with a heterogeneous presentation whose etiology is still uncertain. Not surprisingly, therefore, the definition of, and diagnostic criteria for, PCOS remain controversial.

Objective

The objective of the study was to review and justify the basis for the recently revised definition of PCOS arising from the joint European Society for Human Reproduction & Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM) Rotterdam workshop in 2003.

Intervention(S)

The Rotterdam criteria take account of the broad spectrum of presenting features of PCOS, including women with hyperandrogenism but regular menses and, more controversially, those with menstrual disturbance without overt androgen excess. POSITIONS: The Rotterdam criteria for definition and diagnosis of PCOS, in the opinion of this author, represent a significant advance in recognizing the broad spectrum of presentation of the syndrome and acknowledge that the clinical and biochemical features may vary with time within individuals. The important refinements when compared to the 1990 NIH definition of PCOS are: 1) inclusion of polycystic ovarian morphology; and 2) inclusion of subjects with hirsutism and regular menses.

Conclusions

These new diagnostic criteria for PCOS reflect the significant advances, particularly from studies of familial PCOS, in understanding of the etiology of the syndrome and the basis for its heterogeneity. Under the revised diagnostic criteria, the inclusion of women with hyperandrogenism and regular cycles has met with general agreement. The inclusion of women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries who do not have clear evidence of androgen excess is, in the opinion of this author, also justified but remains a contentious issue and one that requires further investigation.

### Diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: a reappraisal [^dcdd0dc3]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

New diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were proposed in Rotterdam in 2003, which expanded the previous definition that arose from an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990. However, these newer criteria give rise to phenotypes that may not actually represent PCOS, and a simple modification of the 1990 NIH/National Institute of Child Health and Human Disease diagnostic criteria may be more consistent with currently available data.

### Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^80fb5535]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.

### The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: the criteria are insufficiently robust for clinical research [^d2e89998]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder but has considerable phenotypic variability and this has led to controversy over its exact definition and diagnosis. The objective of this study was to review the recently proposed diagnostic criteria to determine whether they were sufficiently robust for clinical and research practise. We have reviewed the literature pertaining to clinical measurement and quality of laboratory analysis in relation to clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism. The recently published statements regarding the diagnosis of PCOS assume that the clinical, laboratory and imaging studies are dichotomous variables, without considering the effect of observer subjectivity or measurement variability on the outcome. The data suggest that there is considerable uncertainty of all measurements and lack of clarity of the definition of the term 'hyperandrogenaemia' which can lead to misdiagnosis. The current diagnostic strategies for PCOS are defined too vaguely to ascertain that individuals fit the definition of the syndrome. A pragmatic approach may be taken in the management of an individual depending upon her particular symptoms and needs. However, research into the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of PCOS will require the production of robust definitions of the diagnostic criteria. We propose specific criteria that would answer the criticisms that we have raised.

### Renaming PCOS – a two-state solution [^08593c7e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

It has become evident over the past 30 years that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is more than a reproductive disorder. It has metabolic sequelae that can affect women across the lifespan. Diagnostic criteria based on the endocrine features of the syndrome, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, identify women at high metabolic risk. The additional phenotypes defined by the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria identify women with primarily reproductive rather than metabolic dysfunction.

Objective

The aim is to discuss the rationale for a separate name for the syndrome that is associated with high metabolic risk while maintaining the current name for the phenotypes with primarily reproductive morbidity.

Intervention

The NIH Office for Disease Prevention-Sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology Workshop on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome recommended that a new name is needed for PCOS. POSITIONS: The authors propose that PCOS be retained for the reproductive phenotypes and that a new name be created for the phenotypes at high metabolic risk.

Conclusions

There should be two names for the PCOS phenotypes: those with primarily reproductive consequences should continue to be called PCOS, and those with important metabolic consequences should have a new name.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^abc2786d]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; ii) reducing unnecessary testing; iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Study Funding/Competing Interest(S)

The guideline was primarily funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) supported by a partnership with ESHRE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Guideline development group members did not receive payment. Travel expenses were covered by the sponsoring organizations. Disclosures of conflicts of interest were declared at the outset and updated throughout the guideline process, aligned with NHMRC guideline processes. Full details of conflicts declared across the guideline development groups are available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos/guideline in the Register of disclosures of interest. Of named authors, Dr Costello has declared shares in Virtus Health and past sponsorship from Merck Serono for conference presentations. Prof. Laven declared grants from Ferring, Euroscreen and personal fees from Ferring, Euroscreen, Danone and Titus Healthcare. Prof. Norman has declared a minor shareholder interest in an IVF unit. The remaining authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. The guideline was peer reviewed by special interest groups across our partner and collaborating societies and consumer organizations, was independently assessed against AGREEII criteria and underwent methodological review. This guideline was approved by all members of the guideline development groups and was submitted for final approval by the NHMRC.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^847511ee]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Diagnosis, phenotype, and prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^97e59384]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

New diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suggested three main phenotypes: classic (hyperandrogenism and anovulation), ovulatory, and normoandrogenic. However, it is unclear whether the normoandrogenic phenotype actually represents PCOS. Overall, 6% to 8% of reproductive-aged women suffer from PCOS, making this disorder one of the most common endocrine abnormalities.

---

### Scientific statement on the diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and molecular genetics of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1eb9a67e]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous and complex disorder that has both adverse reproductive and metabolic implications for affected women. However, there is generally poor understanding of its etiology. Varying expert-based diagnostic criteria utilize some combination of oligo-ovulation, hyperandrogenism, and the presence of polycystic ovaries. Criteria that require hyperandrogenism tend to identify a more severe reproductive and metabolic phenotype. The phenotype can vary by race and ethnicity, is difficult to define in the perimenarchal and perimenopausal period, and is exacerbated by obesity. The pathophysiology involves abnormal gonadotropin secretion from a reduced hypothalamic feedback response to circulating sex steroids, altered ovarian morphology and functional changes, and disordered insulin action in a variety of target tissues. PCOS clusters in families and both female and male relatives can show stigmata of the syndrome, including metabolic abnormalities. Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of candidate regions, although their role in contributing to PCOS is still largely unknown.

### The androgen excess and PCOS society criteria for the polycystic ovary syndrome: the complete task force report [^162e4a5a]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review all available data and recommend a definition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on published peer-reviewed data, whether already in use or not, to guide clinical diagnosis and future research.

Design

Literature review and expert consensus.

Setting

Professional society.

Patients

None.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

A systematic review of the published peer-reviewed medical literature, by querying MEDLINE databases, to identify studies evaluating the epidemiology or phenotypic aspects of PCOS.

Result(S)

The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the Androgen Excess and PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society AE-PCOS Board of Directors. No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence.

Conclusion(S)

Based on the available data, it is the view of the AE-PCOS Society Task Force that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries), and the exclusion of related disorders. However, a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the Task Force recognized and fully expects that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^35202bee]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments to implement the practice of evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs recommendations on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. We extracted data in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains and assessed CPGs methodological quality of using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

Evidence Synthesis

We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. CPGs recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs had a high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%) while stakeholder's involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). We identified inconsistency in recommendations on PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, hirsutism and acne treatments, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

Conclusion

Current CPGs on the diagnosis and management of PCOS vary in their scope and methodological quality, which may hinder evidence translation into clinical practice. We identified disease domains with existing evidence gap to guide future research and guideline updates.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: definition, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^72808e75]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in premenopausal women. Heterogeneous by nature, PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. The aetiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that PCOS might be a complex multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders. This article aims to provide a balanced review of the latest advances and current limitations in our knowledge about PCOS while also providing a few clear and simple principles, based on current evidence-based clinical guidelines, for the proper diagnosis and long-term clinical management of women with PCOS.

### Diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^4db322e5]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female reproductive disorder that often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life. Prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health management. This article incorporates the most recent evidence and consensus guidelines to provide an updated review of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management strategies for adolescents with this complex condition. We will review the recent international guidelines on PCOS; because the diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, management of this condition is inconsistent. In 2019, PCOS remains a common, yet neglected, condition, in part, because of the lack of agreement around both diagnosis and management.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome as a metabolic disease [^f2b41a93]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous familial disorder affecting up to one in five women. The aetiology remains unclear, but available evidence suggests it is a polygenic disorder with epigenetic, developmental, and environmental components. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on reproductive features, and the syndrome is categorized into several phenotypes that can vary by race and ethnicity. Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and contribute to many adverse metabolic outcomes that place a substantial burden on the health of women with PCOS across their lifespan. Metabolic abnormalities like those identified in women with PCOS are also present in their female and male first-degree relatives. Overall, more emphasis is required on defining PCOS as a metabolic disorder in addition to a reproductive one. This approach could affect the management and future treatment options for the syndrome. The rationale of the current review is to identify and analyse existing evidence for PCOS as a metabolic, as well as a reproductive, disease.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^3d5dfc12]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

PCOS diagnosis is complex with the diagnostic criteria generating 4 clinical phenotypes in adults: phenotype A (featuring hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and PCOM), phenotype B (hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction without PCOM), phenotype C (hyperandrogenism and PCOM without ovulatory dysfunction), and phenotype D (ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM without hyperandrogenism). In addition, clinical features of PCOS are heterogeneous with manifestations varying across individuals and the reproductive life stage. While clinical presentation in PCOS does not necessarily correlate with genotype, subdividing PCOS patients by key clinical presentation, such as the presence or absence of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM (ie, phenotypes A-D) is helpful to determine what diagnostic testing may be required. For example, women with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism) and ovulatory dysfunction require only the exclusion of mimicking disorders for the diagnosis of PCOS. Alternatively, women who present solely with menstrual dysfunction may require assessment of ovarian morphology and/or circulating androgens, and if either of these is abnormal, then exclusion of mimicking disorders. Meanwhile, women presenting with what appears to be solely hirsutism merit being evaluated by ovarian ultrasonography or AMH levels, before assessing for mimicking disorders.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^4ddf4e93]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review using a prospectively registered protocol (CRD42018116809) and reported in line with the PRISMA CPGs.

Literature Search

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases within the NICE Healthcare Database Advanced Search platform (hdas.nice.org.uk) using the following search terms to identify eligible CPGs on PCOS from inception until December 2020: clinical, CPGs, consensus statement, position statement, recommendation?, polycystic ovary, polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperandrogen*, anovulation, *menorrhea, wom?n, female, pregnan*. Complementary searches were conducted in Google Scholar, Tripdatabase, and Scopus. We searched the websites of established regulatory bodies on the topic of care for women with PCOS to identify relevant CPGs. We did not apply any search filters or language limitations.

Guideline Selection and Inclusion Process

Two independent reviewers (BHA and MF) completed the study selection and inclusion process in 2 stages. Discrepancies were resolved in consensus with a third reviewer (LB). We included all purpose-developed evidence-based clinical CPGs and consensus statements addressing the diagnosis and/or management of PCOS across different clinical disciplines and populations. We excluded position or opinion statements that did not make direct recommendations linked to specific evidence and systematic reviews from scientific societies. All other designs of primary or secondary studies evaluating a particular scientific question were excluded.

Data Collection

Two independent reviewers (LB and MF) extracted data in duplicate into an electronic Excel sheet, which was piloted for its face validity. Data integrity was double-checked by a third reviewer (BHA). We extracted data on the following guideline characteristics: producing authority, named authors, country of origin, year of publication, consensus method, stakeholders involved, disease domain addressed in the CPG, description of the search strategy to identify evidence, inclusion/exclusion criteria of evidence, quality assessment instruments used, and grading system used. We mapped out the clinical recommendations in each guideline and tabulated them into the following prespecified domains: diagnosis in adolescents and adults; lifestyle interventions; management of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, acne, and infertility; and risk assessment for metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, mental health, and cancer.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^14c42e07]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments to implement the practice of evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs recommendations on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. We extracted data in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains and assessed CPGs methodological quality of using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

Evidence Synthesis

We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. CPGs recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs had a high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%) while stakeholder’s involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). We identified inconsistency in recommendations on PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, hirsutism and acne treatments, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

Conclusion

Current CPGs on the diagnosis and management of PCOS vary in their scope and methodological quality, which may hinder evidence translation into clinical practice. We identified disease domains with existing evidence gap to guide future research and guideline updates.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^4a0d74db]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% to 13% of women globally. It is a condition with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features, with health impacts across the lifespan. The etiology of PCOS is complex, with an interplay of several factors, including genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to hypothalamic-ovarian disturbance. Diagnosis is recommended based on the International PCOS Guideline criteria, with diagnosis confirmed in adults when 2 of out the following 3 criteria are met: (i) hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical); (ii) irregular cycles; and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. With its clinical heterogeneity, distinct phenotypes, variation across the lifespan and ethnic variation, PCOS diagnosis can present significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians.

### Criteria, prevalence, and phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome [^dfda3623]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder effecting reproductive-aged women worldwide. This article addresses the evolution of the criteria used to diagnosis PCOS; reviews recent advances in the phenotypic approach, specifically in the context of the extended Rotterdam criteria; discusses limitations of the current criteria used to diagnosis, particularly when studying adolescents and women in the peri- and postmenopause; and describes significant strides made in understanding the epidemiology of PCOS. This review recognizes that although there is a high prevalence of PCOS, there is increased variability when using Rotterdam 2003 criteria, owing to limitations in population sampling and approaches used to define PCOS phenotypes. Last, we discuss the distribution of PCOS phenotypes, their morbidity, and the role that referral bias plays in the epidemiology of this syndrome.

Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

### Controversy in clinical endocrinology: diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome: the rotterdam criteria are premature [^3ffe085d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined most commonly according to the proceedings of an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in April 1990, which noted the disorder as having 1) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, 2) oligoovulation, and 3) exclusion of known disorders. Alternatively, another expert conference held in Rotterdam in May 2003 defined PCOS, after the exclusion of related disorders, by two of the following three features: 1) oligo- or anovulation, 2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, or 3) polycystic ovaries. In essence, the Rotterdam 2003 expanded the NIH 1990 definition creating two new phenotypes: 1) ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism, and 2) oligoanovulatory women with polycystic ovaries, but without hyperandrogenism.

Objective

The objective of this study was to ascertain the validity of using the Rotterdam 2003 criteria rather than the NIH 1991 criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS.

Intervention(S)

Interventions included the use of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for diagnosing PCOS and, in particular, the proposal to define two new phenotypes as PCOS. POSITIONS: Available data suggest that hyperandrogenic ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries tend to have mild insulin resistance and mild evidence of ovarian dysfunction, although significantly less than women with anovulatory PCOS. However, whether these women will have an increased risk of infertility or metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, remains to be determined. Alternatively, the risk of insulin resistance and long-term metabolic risks of oligoovulatory women with polycystic ovaries is even less well characterized and may be nonexistent.

Conclusions

Because of the paucity of data on the two new phenotypes and their long-term implications and the potential negative impact on research, clinical practice, and patient insurability, the adoption of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for defining PCOS should be considered premature. However, because polycystic ovaries are a frequent feature of PCOS, a modification of the NIH 1990 criteria is proposed. Additional research characterizing the phenotypes and associated morbidities of PCOS is urgently required.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting 8%-13% of reproductive-aged women. The aetiology of the syndrome is complex, with genetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity related dysfunction leading to perturbance in hypothalamic-ovarian function. PCOS clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations arising even in early adolescence, developing into multisystem reproductive, metabolic and psychological manifestations in adulthood. In this review, we will discuss challenges in the diagnosis of PCOS and understanding of the natural history of PCOS.

### Estrogenic ovulatory dysfunction or functional female hyperandrogenism: an argument to discard the term polycystic ovary syndrome [^191fdfe2]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders seen among reproductive-age women, with a prevalence of 4%-9% depending on the criteria used to define the syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been surprisingly controversial and confusing for patients, clinicians, and researchers. We believe that the confusion surrounding PCOS arises almost entirely because its name refers to a trait that is inconsistently present and irrelevant to both the etiology and the treatment of the disorder. We suggest that merely abandoning the term PCOS will cure much of what has ailed us for decades and allow us to focus on the etiology and treatment of the causes of what the experts in this field have come to recognize as functional female hyperandrogenism.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for children [^40166d02]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine syndrome with variable phenotypic expression and important systemic associations and sequelae, including obesity, insulin resistance, infertility, risk of endometrial cancer, and possible risk of cardiovascular events. PCOS is recognized as a condition influenced by genetic and environmental factors and distinct manifestations in all stages of life, including the prenatal period, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Identification of this disorder in childhood and adolescence has received growing attention, in part because of emerging evidence of the benefit of early intervention, but the diagnosis and management of PCOS in children and adolescents can be challenging. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations of PCOS in children are reviewed to enhance identification and evaluation of patients suspected of having this disorder. When a diagnosis of PCOS is suspected in a child but cannot be confirmed, a provisional diagnosis is strongly recommended so as to prompt ongoing monitoring with an emphasis on important early interventions such as obesity reduction.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^b9336b7b]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder that affects about one in 15 women worldwide. The major endocrine disruption is excessive androgen secretion or activity, and a large proportion of women also have abnormal insulin activity. Many body systems are affected in polycystic ovary syndrome, resulting in several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Women with this disorder have an established increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a still debated increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The diagnostic traits of polycystic ovary syndrome are hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries, after exclusion of other conditions that cause these same features. A conclusive definition of the disorder and the importance of the three diagnostic criteria relative to each other remain controversial. The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is unknown, but studies suggest a strong genetic component that is affected by gestational environment, lifestyle factors, or both.

### Update on diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome during adolescence [^b3756a86]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic condition beginning during the peripubertal years. The international evidence-based guidelines and the update in 2023 have clearly defined the diagnostic criteria during adolescence with the goal of decreasing controversies and challenges with the diagnosis during this critical life stage. In this narrative review we aimed to examine the recent available data related to the diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Specifically, we evaluated publications from August 2022 (date when the last searches were run for the update of the international evidence-based guidelines on PCOS) to May 2025. Current evidence supports the use of two main diagnostic criteria for adolescents: irregular menstrual cycles, well defined according to time post-menarche, and hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, after excluding other conditions that mimic PCOS. In contrast to adult PCOS diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology on pelvic ultrasound and/or antimullerian hormone levels should not be used for adolescent PCOS diagnosis. Accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence enables early screening and management of PCOS and its associated comorbidities. Equally important is the early identification of adolescents considered "at risk" of PCOS (those who only meet one diagnostic criterion) as emerging evidence indicated increased metabolic risks and reinforces the need for long-term follow-up. Novel cluster analysis in well-defined adolescent cohorts is beginning to clarify threshold values for diagnostic features and may further refine adolescent-specific criteria. Specific PCOS diagnostic criteria avoiding polycystic ovary morphology and antimullerian hormone; and using of clearly defined irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism should be applied during adolescence. Early recognition of adolescents both with PCOS and those "at risk" is critical to ensure timely metabolic screening and appropriate follow-up. Health care professionals should be aware that different PCOS diagnostic criteria are necessary for adolescents.

### Characterizing the clinical and genetic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome in electronic health records [^083742b3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that is the leading cause of infertility in females. The genetic, environmental, and metabolic variables that contribute to its complex architecture also influence clinical heterogeneity among individuals with PCOS, resulting in a broad spectrum of symptoms. The heterogeneous clinical presentation of PCOS makes it difficult to diagnose, and an estimated 75% of females with PCOS remain undiagnosed.

There are 3 commonly used diagnostic criteria for PCOS that each have specific symptom requirements for diagnosis. The first diagnostic definition was put forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which required an ovulatory phenotype (eg, oligomenorrhoea) and hyperandrogenism for diagnosis. Subsequently, the second diagnostic definition for PCOS was created by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, commonly referred to as the Rotterdam criteria. The Rotterdam diagnostic criteria were designed to expand the PCOS definition from the strict NIH definition by requiring any 2 of the following 3 symptoms: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries. However, the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society argued that hyperandrogenism is the primary driver of PCOS and thus, created a third diagnostic criteria that requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction (eg, oligoanovulation or polycystic ovaries). PCOS diagnostic criteria were developed to improve and standardize diagnoses; however, patients identified by each approach may have differing symptomologies and only a small fraction of females will meet multiple diagnostic criteria.

Implementing a broader PCOS definition could lead to false-positive diagnoses and prevalence overestimations. However, restrictive definitions miss females with clinical manifestations outside the requirements, including metabolic dysfunction. Females with PCOS and metabolic dysfunction are at higher risk for a range of comorbidities, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer, and psychiatric disorders. Delayed screening and treatment for PCOS could exacerbate these metabolic conditions, particularly in underrepresented populations that have a greater baseline risk of metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that African American and Hispanic females with PCOS have an increased risk for metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular disorders, yet little is known about why comorbidities increase across diverse racial and ethnic groups and whether expanding diagnostic criteria for PCOS may improve health equity.

Most prior studies included small numbers of minority females and many have used differing diagnostic criteria. Without larger studies, it is difficult to accurately characterize the clinical presentation of PCOS and its consequences across populations. Adapting an inclusive phenotyping approach capable of identifying severe to mild PCOS presentations could improve study methods for marginalized communities.

Summary of Recommendations

1.0 Diagnosis of PCOS

Diagnosis in adults

1.1 We suggest that the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries (PCO) (Tables 1 and 2), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP]) (Table 3). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes (Table 4) (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

Diagnoses to Consider Excluding in Select Women, Depending on Presentation

Diagnosis in adolescents

1.2 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl be made based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after exclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. Anovulatory symptoms and PCO morphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents, as they may be evident in normal stages in reproductive maturation (2|⊕⊕○○).

Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause

1.3 Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, we suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (2|⊕⊕○○).

2.0 Associated morbidity and evaluation

Cutaneous manifestations

2.1 We recommend that a physical examination should document cutaneous manifestations of PCOS: terminal hair growth (see hirsutism guidelines, Ref.), acne, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### G-trust scorecard (...) [^775f0d1c]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE • PCOS can be diagnosed without using ultrasonography in women with ovulatory dysfunction and clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. • In adults, antimüllerian hormone levels can be used instead of ultrasonography to indicate polycystic ovaries. • Consider treating hirsutism and irregular cycles with a combined oral contraceptive. Limit metformin use to patients with obesity and metabolic risk factors. From the AFP Editors Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive-aged women, affecting up to 13% of this population. An international group of professional organizations has developed an evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS. DIAGNOSIS To diagnose PCOS, two of the following criteria are required: clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, ultrasound images showing polycystic ovaries or elevated antimüllerian hormone levels.

Hyperandrogenism At least 60% of women with PCOS have evidence of hyperandrogenism using clinical or biochemical markers. To diagnose clinical hyperandrogenism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score is recommended to assess facial and terminal hair growth, although presentations differ among ethnicities.

### Do different diagnostic criteria impact polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis for adolescents? [^c312bd25]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although early diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents might allow for earlier treatment and prevention of chronic disorders, incorrect or premature diagnosis carries risks of unnecessary treatment and psychological distress. There is no consensus concerning which diagnostic criteria to use for adolescents and current criteria vary. The objective of this study was to determine whether using different diagnostic criteria will affect PCOS diagnosis in adolescents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifty-two patients aged 13-18 years with at least 2 of the following criteria were included in the study: (1) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; (2) Clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and (3) polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. Patients were then categorized according to the 6 different criteria for PCOS. National Institutes of Health, Rotterdam criteria, Androgen Excess Society, Amsterdam criteria, Endocrine Society criteria, and the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria. The characteristics of adolescents who were diagnosed with PCOS were also evaluated.

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

Forty-one patients out of 52 (78.8%) received diagnosis with National Institutes of Health and Endocrine Society criteria, all with Rotterdam criteria, 45/52 (86.5%) with Androgen Excess Society criteria, 36/52 (69.2%) with Amsterdam criteria and 34/52 (65.4%) with the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria.

Results and Conclusion

This study shows that the choice of guideline used does have a great effect on whether an adolescent received the PCOS diagnosis or not. For physicians using the broader criteria, care should be taken to ensure the patient does not receive diagnosis because of the physiological changes seen during puberty, which might mimic PCOS. For those using stricter criteria, close monitoring of patients who do not receive diagnosis is necessary to prevent chronic complications.

### Positions statement: criteria for defining polycystic ovary syndrome as a predominantly hyperandrogenic syndrome: an androgen excess society guideline [^a5c35f22]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The Androgen Excess Society (AES) charged a task force to review all available data and recommend an evidence-based definition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), whether already in use or not, to guide clinical diagnosis and future research.

Participants

Participants included expert investigators in the field.

Evidence

Based on a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed medical literature, by querying MEDLINE databases, we tried to identify studies evaluating the epidemiology or phenotypic aspects of PCOS.

Consensus Process

The task force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents and minority opinions noted. Statements that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence were not included.

Conclusions

Based on the available data, it is the view of the AES Task Force on the Phenotype of PCOS that there should be acceptance of the original 1990 National Institutes of Health criteria with some modifications, taking into consideration the concerns expressed in the proceedings of the 2003 Rotterdam conference. A principal conclusion was that PCOS should be first considered a disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism, although a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the task force recognized, and fully expects, that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings.

### Are young adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome slipping through the healthcare cracks? [^4269e84e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder often diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. In adolescence, the many similarities between normal features of puberty and symptoms of PCOS make it challenging to confirm the diagnosis. Even among adult women, the changing definitions of PCOS may lead to inaccurate diagnoses. Women may present with a variety of symptoms to different healthcare providers and may be treated only for the presenting symptoms without evaluation of the syndrome and its associated morbidities. Timely evaluations, accurate diagnosis, appropriate interventions, and multidisciplinary healthcare teams can be valuable because women with PCOS have an increased risk for obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, infertility, endometrial cancer, and anxiety and mood disorders. Appropriate transition of care for the adolescent from pediatric to adult healthcare providers should include education of the patient and her parents regarding the chronic nature of the syndrome and the need for continued follow-up. Girls with symptoms suggestive of PCOS who fail to fulfill diagnostic criteria should undergo prolonged observation. Early identification of PCOS at different entry points in the healthcare system will require physician education and improved access.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^82abe836]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of 8–13%. Its pathogenesis includes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism which drive the reproductive (menstrual dysfunction, infertility), metabolic (metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors), and psychological (anxiety, depression, low quality of life) complications. Given the high prevalence and diverse features across the lifespan, as well as the high prevalence of obesity which further exacerbates its clinical features, PCOS contributes to the global burden of disease. It is therefore imperative to recognize the condition early to facilitate interventions and prevent complications.

Being a heterogeneous disorder, the diagnosis of PCOS is difficult and often delayed. PCOS diagnosis is based on oligo-anovulation (OA), biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound extending across the original 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria (OA and HA), the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (any two of OA, HA, and PCOM), and the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society criteria (HA and OA or PCOM or both). The Rotterdam criteria are now widely accepted and generate four possible diagnostic PCOS phenotypes in adult women: (A) OA + HA + PCOM, (B) OA + HA, (C) HA + PCOM, and (D) OA + PCOM. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence-based guideline, which was co-developed based on unprecedented evidence synthesis and best practice methods, by world-leading multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers across 37 societies from 71 countries, with consumer engagement.

2 THE HISTORY OF PCOS AND ITS DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

In 1935, Drs Stein and Leventhal first published a case series of seven women with enlarged ovaries in association with menstrual disturbance and/or clinical HA.The term Stein‐Leventhal syndrome arose, but other names such as sclerocystic ovary syndrome and polycystic ovary disease were used interchangeably before the term polycystic ovary syndrome was finally settled on in the early 1990s. Nevertheless, there is ongoing advocacy for a name change for the condition as many clinicians, researchers and affected women consider the name PCOS a misnomer that does not reflect the true characteristics or complexity of the disorder.Over and above renaming the disorder, the ideal diagnostic criteria for PCOS remains an ongoing and unresolved debate. Currently available diagnostic criteria and their phenotypes are presented in Table 1. Phenotypes A and B are considered ‘classic’ PCOS, Phenotype C is ‘ovulatory PCOS’ and Phenotype D is regarded as ‘nonhyperandrogenic PCOS’.

Table 1 
PCOS diagnostic criteria and phenotypes

The first attempt to define PCOS occurred in an expert conference in 1990 sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH).After a survey of all participants, mainly from US, regarding their perception of PCOS features, they concluded PCOS as an androgen‐excess disorder of exclusion with ovarian consequences.The 1990 NIH criteria therefore defines PCOS as the presence of both clinical and/or biochemical HA and ovulatory dysfunction (OD).Using the criteria, PCOS prevalence is estimated to be between 5% and 8%, raising worldwide recognition for PCOS to be the most prevalent endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age.While the diagnostic criteria were driven mainly by expert consensus rather than research evidence, it sets the scene for much of the subsequent literature, which contributes greatly to our current understanding of PCOS.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome. A diagnostic challenge [^8a8cece6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome remains a diagnostic challenge because there is no single defining test. The clinical presentation must dictate the extent of the work-up. The typical PCOS patient has a history of irregular menses and appears hirsute. Demonstration of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism can also be made by appropriate hormonal measurements. An ultrasound showing multiple small ovarian follicles can support a diagnosis of PCOS in the patient for whom the clinical diagnosis has been made. Other causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction should be excluded.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^c2b98d72]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

PCOS is more challenging to diagnose in adolescents, as menstrual irregularity and multi-follicular ovaries are part of normal pubertal physiology and the application of adult criteria results in a high prevalence and may over-diagnose PCOS. Available recommendations on adolescent PCOS diagnostic criteria are inconsistent. The 2018 international PCOS guideline updated the Rotterdam criteria and now recommends applying OA and HA while avoiding PCOM for PCOS diagnosis in adolescents. However, this evidence-informed recommendation was ultimately based on expert consensus with limited evidence on the most accurate diagnostic approach in adolescents and on the natural history of PCOS phenotypes over time. It remains unclear if the 2018 updated Rotterdam criteria capture adolescents with PCOS who are at the greatest risk of long-term complications and would benefit the most from lifestyle preventative interventions.

Long-term weight gain is a major health concern for women with PCOS and a key pathophysiological contributor to PCOS severity. More than 60% of women with PCOS are above healthy body mass index (BMI), exacerbating metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features of PCOS. These effects can be ameliorated by 5–10% weight loss, and lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain and promote weight loss is therefore the cornerstone of PCOS management. However, existing studies examining the natural history of weight gain in women with PCOS are limited to largely clinic-based adult populations and women with self-reported PCOS and do not differentiate across various PCOS diagnostic criteria or phenotypes.

To address research priorities and evidence gaps, the aims of the present study in an unselected adolescent population were threefold. Firstly, we aimed to examine the impact of the original 2003 versus the 2018 updated Rotterdam criteria on the prevalence of PCOS diagnosis. Secondly, we aimed to examine the natural history of BMI trajectories in women with and without PCOS from birth until young adulthood, applying both the original and updated adolescent Rotterdam criteria. Thirdly, we aimed to determine BMI trajectories across adolescent phenotypes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4357145c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

1.1 Evidence

PCOS is a common disorder with systemic metabolic manifestations. Its etiology is complex, heterogeneous, and poorly understood. There are three definitions for PCOS currently in use that variably rely on androgen excess, chronic anovulation, and PCO to make the diagnosis (Table 1). However, all criteria are consistent in that PCOS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. All three sets of diagnostic criteria include hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, and anovulation. The Rotterdam criteria were the first to incorporate ovarian morphology on ultrasound as part of the diagnostic criteria.

The panel from a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology workshop on PCOS endorsed the Rotterdam criteria, although they identified the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three cardinal features (Table 2). These criteria allow the diagnosis to be made clinically (based upon a history of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation) as well as biochemically with androgen assays or with ultrasound examination of the ovaries. We do not endorse the need for universal screening with androgen assays or ultrasound if patients already meet two of the three criteria clinically. It is recommended that the features leading to the diagnosis are documented. We recommend using the current definition of the Rotterdam criteria to document PCO morphology (at least one ovary with 12 follicles of 2–9 mm or a volume >10 mL in the absence of a dominant follicle >10 mm), in the absence of age-based criteria.

Disorders that mimic PCOS are comparatively easy to exclude; therefore, all women should be screened with a TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP level (Table 3). Hyperprolactinemia can present with amenorrhea or hirsutism. Thyroid disease may present with irregular menstrual cycles. In women with hyperandrogenism, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be excluded because it can be found in 1.5–6.8% of patients presenting with androgen excess. In select women who present with amenorrhea, virilization, or physical findings not associated with PCOS, such as proximal muscle weakness (Cushing's syndrome) or frontal bossing (acromegaly), other diagnoses should be considered and excluded (Table 4).

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 194—polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C). Combination low-dose hormonal contraceptives are most frequently used for long-term management and are recommended as the primary treatment of menstrual disorders. Women in groups at higher risk of nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia and a suspected diagnosis of PCOS should be screened to assess the 17-hydroxyprogesterone value. A low-dose regimen is recommended when using gonadotropins in women with PCOS. There is no clear primary treatment for hirsutism in PCOS.

### Gaps in knowledge among physicians regarding diagnostic criteria and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^784bf0cd]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify gaps in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) knowledge and practice patterns among physicians in North America in response to significant dissatisfaction identified among women with PCOS regarding their diagnosis and treatment experience.

Design

Online survey conducted via American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology of gynecologists (ObGyn) and American Society of Reproductive Medicine of reproductive endocrinologists (REI-ObGyn) in 2015-16.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

None.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Diagnostic criteria used, key features of PCOS, management practices.

Result(S)

Of the 630 surveys completed, 70.2% were ObGyn and 64.4% were females. Overall 27.7% respondents did not know which PCOS diagnostic criteria they used. In a multivariable analysis including physician type, age, gender, and number of patients with PCOS seen annually, REI-ObGyn were less likely compared with ObGyn to report not knowing which criteria they used (adjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.16). REI-ObGyn were more likely to use the Rotterdam criteria (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.33, 3.82). The majority of respondents recognized the clinical features associated with PCOS; however, over one-third associated "cysts on ovaries" with PCOS. The majority of responders (>85%) were aware of cardiometabolic comorbidities; however, fewer ObGyn were aware of associated depression, anxiety disorders, and reduced quality of life. More REI-ObGyn recommended lifestyle changes compared with ObGyn (56.4% vs. 41.6%).

Conclusion(S)

Our large-scale PCOS survey, conducted in response to patient concerns regarding diagnosis and treatment, highlights opportunities for physician education. Focus areas include targeting knowledge of internationally accepted Rotterdam criteria and ensuring consistent care informed by evidence-based guidelines across the reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features of PCOS.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^92fdaf8a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the 2003 Rotterdam criteria is the most widely used diagnostic criteria for PCOS and this is also the definition recommended by the 2018 international PCOS EBG to diagnose adult women.Diagnosis in adolescents can be particularly challenging due to the overlap of PCOS diagnostic features with normal pubertal physiology. As such, the application of the Rotterdam criteria in adolescents is likely to over‐diagnose adolescents with PCOS with potential detrimental long‐term health implications.With a lack of research on an accurate diagnostic approach in adolescents, based on evidence‐informed consensus, the new PCOS guideline recommends modified diagnostic criteria in adolescents. The guideline recommends that the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents requires menstrual cycle irregularity well defined according to time post menarche and clinical HA (severe acne and/or hirsutism)/biochemical HA as the two essential criteria.It is recommended that PCOM should not be used as a criterion for PCOS diagnosis within 8 years of menarche.Adolescents meeting one of the PCOS diagnostic criterion may be considered ‘at risk’ of PCOS and benefit from follow up, in addition to symptom management.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^629048dc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition affecting ~ 8% of adolescents. The adolescent PCOS diagnostic criteria have been controversial due to the overlap of the pubertal changes with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria. These pubertal changes including menstrual irregularities, acne, and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) are well recognized. Given the prevalence of menstrual irregularities during the early postmenarcheal years, mild acne or PCOM, these PCOS diagnostic criteria during adolescence can result in overdiagnosis. Conversely, disregarding diagnostic features can result in delayed or underdiagnosis with adverse long-term consequences [,–]. Delayed diagnosis has been reported by individuals who described symptoms starting in adolescence. Hence, nuanced diagnostic criteria are key to accurate and timely diagnosis.

The original consensus-based Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis were upgraded to evidence-based criteria in the 2018 and 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline. The 2023 Guideline recommends adult diagnosis on the basis of the identification of at least two of these recognized features: (1) menstrual irregularities/ovulatory dysfunction, (2) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (3) PCOM on ultrasound or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels ; however, neither PCOM nor AMH levels are suitable for diagnosing PCOS during adolescence.

In the 2023 update of the PCOS International Evidence-based Guideline (“The Guideline”), we aimed to develop and provide comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment to improve the lives of those with PCOS worldwide from adolescence to adulthood. This manuscript highlights the adolescent-specific recommendations from the 2023 Guideline with supporting evidence. The term “adolescent” refers to individuals between 10 and 19 years of age according to the World Health Organization definition and women within 8 years postmenarche (gynecological age of 8 years or less) have also been identified for specific recommendations.

Polycystic ovary syndrome—incidence, definition, and diagnostic criteria emphasize that there is no universally accepted definition of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and multiple expert-generated criteria exist; the Rotterdam criteria incorporated ultrasound appearance of the ovary, the Androgen Excess Society (AES) criteria recognize hyperandrogenism as necessary, secondary causes should first be excluded, diagnostic schemes require more than one sign or symptom, polycystic ovaries alone are a nonspecific finding, and insulin resistance is not included in any diagnostic criteria. Prevalence varies by criteria: women meeting National Institutes of Health (NIH) hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation criteria make up approximately 7% of reproductive-aged women; the broader Rotterdam criteria increase prevalence in women with normogonadotropic anovulation to 91% from 55% using the NIH criteria; there are no significant differences in the prevalence of hirsutism or elevated circulating androgen levels between white and black women; and prevalence according to AES criteria will fall between these values.

### Polycystic ovarian syndrome: role of imaging in diagnosis [^96cf09b3]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age and carries with it significant health risks, including infertility, endometrial hyperplasia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The workup of PCOS has evolved to include the use of pelvic ultrasonography (US). Ovarian imaging is crucial in the evaluation of patients with suspected PCOS. Although findings of polycystic ovaries are commonly seen at routine US and are frequently not associated with PCOS, awareness of the criteria and definitions used in the diagnosis of PCOS is important, especially in patients who are being evaluated for ovulatory dysfunction or hyperandrogenism. The imaging report should be specific and should include ovarian volumes and antral follicle counts, in addition to other pertinent findings (eg, the presence of a dominant follicle or corpus luteum). Because patients are frequently referred for radiologic imaging as a part of clinical workup, and polycystic ovaries are a common incidental finding in women undergoing US for other gynecologic complaints, radiologists should be aware of the current diagnostic criteria for PCOS, the role of imaging in workup for this abnormality, and the pertinent reporting parameters for pelvic US.

Method of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase “we recommend” and the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase “we suggest” and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that ⊕○○○ denotes very low quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these remarks are considered.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex heterogeneous multisystem disorder affecting 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged womenand 3%–11% of adolescent girlsdepending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. PCOS is characterized by oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adult women.PCOS has significant metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes (T2DM),cardiovascular risk factors), reproductive (anovulation, subfertility)and psychological (depression, anxiety,eating disorders,impaired quality of life),sequelae. Diagnosis of PCOS using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria is based on the presence of two of three features: oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical HA and PCOM on ultrasound following exclusion of secondary causes. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence‐based guideline (EBG) for adult women.This guideline with recommendations for PCOS diagnosis and management is underpinned by an extensive process of evidence synthesis involving 37 professional societies and consumer groups around the world, 71 experts in all aspects of PCOS, including consumers and extensive literature review with 40 systematic reviews and 20 narrative reviews detailed in the 1800 page guideline evidence document.,

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^05acc66c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition among reproductive‐aged women, affecting 10%–13% of this population.Underpinned by endocrine abnormalities, the multifaceted nature of PCOS includes diverse metabolic, reproductive, dermatological, and psychological sequelae, which vary depending on lifestyle, environmental, ethnic, and genetic factors.The heterogenous and evolving nature of symptoms across the lifespan in PCOS contributes to its complex presentation and has historically made diagnosis challenging.Based on the International Evidence‐based Guideline PCOS diagnostic criteria,which builds on the earlier consensus‐based Rotterdam criteria,PCOS is diagnosed in adults on the basis of two of three components: (i) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (ii) ovulatory dysfunction, including anovulation or chronic oligo‐ovulation, and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels,after exclusion of other possible aetiologies.Testing for the latter of these criteria (ultrasound or AMH) is only required where the first two criteria are not met.In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and ovarian features are not included as they are non‐specific for PCOS at this life stage.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^236a197a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before they are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict of interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.

Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (eg, stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through The Endocrine Society office.

Funding for this guideline was derived solely from The Endocrine Society, and thus the Task Force received no funding or remuneration from commercial or other entities.

1.0 Diagnosis of PCOS

Diagnosis in adults

1.1 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or PCO (Tables 1 and 2), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-OHP) (Table 3). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes (Table 4) (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

### New diagnostic option for polycystic ovarian syndrome (...) [^e0bd102c]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

PCOS is a syndromic diagnosis, and there are no specific criteria that diagnose it unequivocally. Previously, guidelines have favored the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS. In adults, meeting at least two of the three Rotterdam criteria supports a diagnosis of PCOS. An updated international guideline by the PCOS Network adds the new diagnostic option of elevated antimüllerian hormone levels in place of an ultrasonography showing polycystic ovaries to diagnose PCOS. AMH is solely secreted from ovarian follicles. This blood test is less invasive, more accessible, and less expensive than ultrasonography. The etiology of elevated AMH in PCOS appears to be multifactorial and is incompletely understood. Genetics appear to play a role, with some studies implicating polymorphisms associated with AMH. Production of AMH also appears to be higher in the ovaries of women with PCOS.

AMH varies with age, body mass index, and laboratory results, so there is not yet a standardized threshold for diagnosis. An AMH cutoff value of 3. 8 ng/mL when used in place of ultrasound criteria was estimated to be > 80% sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PCOS in one study. AMH levels are considered fairly stable and may be evaluated at any time in the menstrual cycle. AMH tends to be lower in patients with a higher BMI and recent or current hormonal contraceptive use. AMH should not be measured in adolescents for the purpose of diagnosing PCOS because it may be physiologically higher in this group. AMH peaks at about 20 to 25 years of age. An elevated AMH level is useful but not necessary for the diagnosis of PCOS. In the absence of other criteria, an elevated AMH level is insufficient for the diagnosis of PCOS. AMH levels are also useful in the assessment of ovarian reserve, such as for the evaluation of infertility.

The clinical calculator "Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome" for polycystic ovary syndrome and amenorrhea.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) in women of reproductive age. This diagnostic tool is based on the presence of two out of three criteria: oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The clinical utility of this calculator is to accurately diagnose PCOS, which is a common endocrine disorder in women that can lead to infertility, metabolic syndrome, and increased cardiovascular risk. The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria exclude other etiologies that can cause similar symptoms, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing's syndrome.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) involves evaluating three key symptoms: amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods, clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound.

The diagnostic process involves three possible symptoms:

1. Amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods
2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism
3. Polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound

The algorithm checks combinations of these symptoms to determine if the diagnostic criteria are met for PCOS. The following logical checks are applied:

- Check for the presence of amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods (A).
- Check for the presence of clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (B).
- Check for the presence of polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound (C).

The criteria are considered met if any two of the three symptoms are present. Specifically:

- If both A and B are true.
- If both A and C are true.
- If both B and C are true.

If at least two conditions out of the three specified are true, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are met

If fewer than two conditions are met, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are not met

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^751141be]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder, representing the single most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in reproductive-aged women. Currently there are four recognized phenotypes of PCOS: 1) hyperandrogenism+oligo-anovulation+polycystic ovarian morphology; 2) hyperandrogenism+oligo-anovulation; 3) hyperandrogenism+polycystic ovarian morphology; and 4) oligo-anovulation+polycystic ovarian morphology, each with different long-term health and metabolic implications. Clinicians should clearly denote a patient's phenotype when making the diagnosis of PCOS. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a highly inherited complex polygenic, multifactorial disorder. Pathophysiologically abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion or action, ovarian folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, insulin secretion or action, and adipose tissue function, among others, have been described in PCOS. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus; hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome; hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular thrombosis, cerebrovascular accidents, and possibly cardiovascular events; subfertility and obstetric complications; endometrial atypia or carcinoma, and possibly ovarian malignancy; and mood and psychosexual disorders. The evaluation of patients suspected of having PCOS includes a thorough history and physical examination, assessment for the presence of hirsutism, ovarian ultrasonography, and hormonal testing to confirm hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation as needed and to exclude similar or mimicking disorders. Therapeutic decisions in PCOS depend on the patients' phenotype, concerns, and goals, and should focus on 1) suppressing and counteracting androgen secretion and action, 2) improving metabolic status, and 3) improving fertility. However, despite significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of the disorder over the past 20 years, the disorder remains underdiagnosed and misunderstood by many practitioners.

### What every physician should know about polycystic ovary syndrome [^57c10763]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine cause of hirsutism, acne, and pattern alopecia. It is a heterogeneous syndrome of hyperandrogenic anovulation that is typically due to intrinsic ovarian dysfunction, which is often aggravated by insulin-resistant hyperinsulinemia with its risks of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and their complications. Because there are many pitfalls to androgen assays, evaluation for hyperandrogenemia is suggested in women with moderate or severe hirsutism or hirsutism equivalents, menstrual irregularity, acanthosis nigricans, or intractable obesity. An endocrinologic work-up is necessary to rule out other hyperandrogenic disorders that require specific therapy (e.g., virilizing tumors, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, and Cushing's syndrome). Ultrasonography helps in the differential diagnosis and may demonstrate the polycystic ovaries that have recently been vetted as an alternative to oligo-anovulation as a diagnostic criterion. Management of PCOS is determined by symptomatology. For those women not desiring pregnancy, the most common therapies are oral contraceptive pills, antiandrogens (contraindicated in the absence of adequate contraception), and insulin-lowering treatments (which have little effect on hirsutism).

Processes aligned with all elements of the AGREE-II tool for quality guideline assessment, with extensive evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Integrity assessment was integrated into guideline evidence synthesis processes and followed the Research Integrity in Guideline Development (RIGID) framework, with studies assessed against criteria from the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) tool and the Trustworthiness in RAndomised Controlled Trials (TRACT) checklist. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations. Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, also evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Categories of PCOS guideline recommendations

The terms include “should”, “could” and “should not”, which are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and the evidence quality and are independent descriptors reflecting GDG judgement. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. “Should” is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms “could” or “should/could consider” which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. “Should not” applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^973dd91d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine partly sponsored another expert conference in Rotterdam in 2003.Deliberately including international experts from Europe and US, the consensus workshop group recognized PCOM on ultrasound as a cardinal feature of PCOS and proposed to include it as another diagnostic criterion.The 2003 Rotterdam criteria broaden the definition of PCOS as the presence of any two of the three features of HA, OD and PCOM, after the exclusion of other causes.This definition recognized additional phenotypes not included in the 1990 NIH criteria and further increased the prevalence of PCOS to between 8% and 13%.The NIH Evidence‐based Methodology Workshop on PCOS later also recommended to endorse the 2003 Rotterdam criteria in 2012.

The latest addition of PCOS diagnostic criteria was proposed in 2006 by the Androgen Excess Society, now known as the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS). The Task Force included seven international experts in the field and generated a consensus, supported by evidence from a systematic literature search to reinstate PCOS as primarily a hyperandrogenic disorder and defines PCOS to be the presence of HA with either OD or PCOM.This definition is broader than the 1990 NIH criteria but slightly more restrictive than the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, and gives rise to an estimated PCOS prevalence of 7%–13%.Acknowledging that multiple classifications of PCOS adds to the confusion around PCOS diagnosis and that the addition of yet another set of diagnostic criteria for PCOS may be futile, the AEPCOS Task Force highlighted the need for PCOS definition to be evidence‐based and highlighted that the definition of PCOS will likely evolve over time with newer research findings.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 8–13%.According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS is diagnosed based on the presence of two out of three characteristics: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities (oligo or anovulation), and the detection of polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound, after the exclusion of other causes.The Androgen Excess-PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) state that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction, and the exclusion of other related disorders.While the AE-PCOS and NIH largely agree with the diagnostic criteria outlined in Rotterdam, hyperandrogenism is considered to be a fundamental component in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Reproductive (irregular menses, infertility and pregnancy complications),metabolic (increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and psychological (depression, disordered eating, body image distress, and reduced quality of life) characteristics are associated with PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1): Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing’s Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^03db3a26]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents with obesity—diagnostic criteria, evaluation, and recommendations: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and disordered ovulatory function and is often associated with obesity and insulin resistance. For adolescent diagnosis, recommendations include: (1) evidence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (2) persistent irregular menstrual cycles (<20 days or >45 days) 2 years after menarche, with prevalence estimates that range from 3% to 11%, depending on the criteria for diagnosis. Evaluation for PCOS in an adolescent requires first excluding other medical conditions causing menstrual dysfunction and/or signs of androgen excess, and for adolescents, evaluation should occur 2 years after menarche. Laboratory testing may include: 17-hydroxyprogesterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, prolactin, free thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, and insulin; interpretation should use age-appropriate reference ranges and referral to a laboratory that can perform ultrasensitive pediatric assays is recommended. Routine ovarian imaging is not indicated for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. The CPG authors recommend pediatricians and other PHCPs: Evaluate for menstrual irregularities and signs of hyperandrogenism (ie, hirsutism, acne) among female adolescents with obesity to assess risk for PCOS.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^9acfeefd]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is challenging to diagnose. While the 2003 Rotterdam criteria are widely used for adults, the 2018 international PCOS guideline recommended updated Rotterdam criteria with both hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation for adolescents based on evidence-informed expert consensus. This study compared the prevalence of PCOS using updated and original Rotterdam criteria in community-based adolescents and explored long-term body mass index (BMI) trajectories across different diagnostic phenotypes.

Methods

Overall, 227 postmenarchal adolescent females from the prospective cohort Raine Study undertook comprehensive PCOS assessment at age 14–16 years. Detailed anthropometric measurements were collected from birth until age 22 years. Cross-sectional and longitudinal BMI were analyzed using t tests and generalized estimating equations.

Results

PCOS was diagnosed in 66 (29.1%) participants using original criteria versus 37 (16.3%) participants using updated Rotterdam criteria. Using updated criteria, participants with PCOS had higher BMI than participants without PCOS from prepubertal. Only the phenotype meeting the updated criteria was significantly associated with higher long-term BMI gain whereas other PCOS phenotypes had similar BMI trajectories to participants without PCOS (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of the 2018 updated Rotterdam criteria reduces over-diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents and identifies those at the greatest risk of long-term weight gain, a key contributor to disease severity and long-term health implications. The BMI trajectories of females with PCOS on updated criteria diverge prepubertally compared to those without PCOS. This work supports targeting adolescents diagnosed with PCOS on the 2018 updated criteria for early lifestyle interventions to prevent long-term health complications.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)—diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: “Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion,” whereas “the Rotterdam definition … allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism.” For management, “prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction,” and “the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC).” “The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety,” while “Metformin alone is less effective than CC,” and adding metformin to CC “should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance”; accordingly, “the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended.” If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, “the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS),” with exogenous gonadotropins “associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies” requiring “careful monitoring of ovarian response.”

### Simplified 4-item criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: a bridge too far? [^ef66f079]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although the Rotterdam 2003 polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnostic criteria is widely used, the need to consider multiple variables makes it unwieldy in clinical practice. We propose a simplified PCOS criteria wherein diagnosis is made if two of the following three items were present: (i) oligomenorrhoea, (ii) anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) above threshold and/or (iii) hyperandrogenism defined as either testosterone above threshold and/or the presence of hirsutism.

Design Setting and Participants

This prospective cross-sectional study consists of healthy women (n = 157) recruited at an annual hospital health screen for staff and volunteers from the university community, and a patient cohort (n = 174) comprising women referred for suspected PCOS.

Main Outcome Measures

We used the healthy cohort to establish threshold values for serum testosterone, antral follicle counts (AFC), ovarian volume (OV) and AMH. Women from the patient cohort, classified as PCOS by simplified PCOS criteria, AMH alone and Rotterdam 2003, were compared with respect to prevalence of oligomenorrhoea, hyperandrogenism and metabolic indices.

Results

In healthy women, testosterone ≥1.89 nmol/L, AFC ≥22 follicles and OV ≥8.44 mL, best predicted oligomenorrhoea and were used as threshold values for PCOS criteria. An AMH level ≥37.0 pmol/L best predicted polycystic ovarian morphology. AMH alone as a single biomarker demonstrated poor specificity (58.9%) for PCOS compared to Rotterdam 2003. In contrast, there was a 94% overlap in women selected as PCOS by the simplified PCOS criteria and Rotterdam 2003. The population characteristics of these two groups of PCOS women showed no significant mean differences in androgenic, ovarian, AMH and metabolic (BMI, HOMA-IR) variables.

Conclusions

Our data recommend the simplified PCOS criteria with population-specific thresholds for diagnosis of PCOS. Its ability to replace ovarian ultrasound biometry with the highly correlated variable AMH, and use of testosterone as a single marker for hyperandrogenaemia alongside the key symptoms of oligomenorrhoea and hirsutism confers significant clinical potential for the diagnosis of PCOS.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^c76aefe5]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length >35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35-36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women <17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8e2949fa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

1.1 Values and preferences

In the absence of evidence-based diagnostic criteria, we have relied on the recommendations of the NIH Panel as noted above. The presence of specific phenotypic features may result in different risk and comorbidity profiles. For example, hyperandrogenism may be more highly associated with metabolic abnormalities, whereas irregular menses and PCO morphology may be more highly associated with infertility. When interpreting published research, clinicians should note that criteria different from their own may be used when performing research. The committee notes that the diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in women who are perimenarchal or perimenopausal because amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are natural stages in reproductive maturation and senescence, as are changes in circulating androgens and ovarian morphology. Therefore, we discuss the diagnosis of PCOS separately in these groups. Finally, because there is evidence of a genetic component to PCOS and familial clustering of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in male and female relatives, a careful family history should be taken, and further screening of first-degree relatives is a consideration.

Diagnosis in adolescents

1.2 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl be made based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after exclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. Anovulatory symptoms and PCO morphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents because they may be evident in normal stages in reproductive maturation (2|⊕⊕○○).

1.2 Evidence

All PCOS diagnostic criteria were derived for adults (Table 1), not adolescents. Furthermore, normal adolescent physiology may mimic symptoms of PCOS. Oligomenorrhea is common after menarche during normal puberty and is therefore not specific to adolescents with PCOS. Anovulatory cycles comprise 85% of menstrual cycles in the first year after menarche, 59% in the third year, and 25% by the sixth year. Anovulatory cycles are associated with higher serum androgen and LH levels. Approximately two-thirds of adolescents with PCOS will have menstrual symptoms, and for one-third it will be the presenting symptom, with the spectrum from primary amenorrhea to frequent dysfunctional bleeding. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate persistent oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea as an early clinical sign of PCOS, especially when it persists 2 years beyond menarche.

Incidence of menstrual cycle irregularities in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—In adolescents with PCOS, about 43% presented with oligomenorrhea, and 28% had either primary (7%) or secondary (21%) amenorrhea; approximately 21% reported regular cycles, and 7% reported frequent cycles with a cycle interval of less than 21 days. In adults with PCOS, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea occurs in up to 95% of cases, with reports ranging from 45% up to 95% depending on diagnostic definitions. By definition, if the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria are used, 100% of women with PCOS have irregular menstrual cycles, whereas under the Rotterdam consensus definition up to 30% have regular cycles.

Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—diagnostic suggestions: During adolescence, a positive diagnosis of PCOS should require all elements of the Rotterdam consensus (and not just two out of three). It may be better to define hyperandrogenism as hyperandrogenemia and discount clinical findings such as acne and alopecia, with the exception of documented progressive hirsutism. Oligo-amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years, and the diagnosis of polycystic ovaries by abdominal ultrasound should also include increased ovarian volume (> 10 cm3). Thus, the diagnosis of PCOS should be considered only in girls who had menarche at least 2 years before diagnosis. By use of these parameters, clinicians may confirm the diagnosis PCOS only in adolescents who have hyperandrogenism, oligo-amenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, and when the diagnosis cannot be confirmed, the patients should be observed closely until adulthood. For ovarian-size context in adolescents, maximal ovarian size is expected to occur 1.25 to 3.8 years after menarche.

### The risk of metabolic syndrome in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c821658a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide the most reliable estimate risk of MetS in women with PCOS, compared to healthy controls.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed [including Medline], Web of Science and Scopus databases for retrieving articles in English language on the prevalence/incidence and odds of MetS in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. Mantel-Haenszel methods of meta-analysis were used to present results in terms of the pooled odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) using fixed/random-effects models with/without the publication bias correction, based on the various subgroups of age and study methods. Newcastle-Ottawa Scaling and The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool were used to evaluate the quality of studies included.

Results

The search strategy yielded 2759 potentially relevant articles of which 44 articles were included for meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the patients with PCOS regardless of age, BMI and recruitment sources of samples had higher odds of MetS compared to healthy controls (OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.2). However, adolescents with PCOS had an increased odds of MetS compared to healthy adolescent controls in population- and nonpopulation-based studies (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-11.9; OR 6.1, 95% CI 6.0- 6.1, respectively). However, the odds of MetS had no differences between adults with PCOS compared to healthy controls in population-based studies. These results were confirmed by the subgroup meta-analysis of some studies using age and BMI adjustment/matching. In addition, subgroup analysis based on diagnostic criteria of PCOS showed that the OR of MetS in PCOS using NIH criteria was higher than AES and Rotterdam criteria (Pooled Overall OR based on NIH criteria = 6.05, 95% CIL: 6.0-6.04).

Conclusion

These findings provide some information on the real features and a broader view of this syndrome that also helps clarify conflicting results documented in the literature. Accordingly, in prevention strategies, routine screening for metabolic syndrome is suggested for adolescents with PCOS.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^5cb90876]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex heterogeneous multisystem disorder affecting 10% to 13% of reproductive-aged women and 3% to 11% of adolescent girls, depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria applied. The cardinal hormonal abnormalities in PCOS are hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. PCOS has significant metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors), reproductive (anovulation, menstrual dysfunction, subfertility), dermatological (hirsutism, acne, female pattern hair loss), and psychological (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, impaired quality of life) sequelae. The 2023 International PCOS Guideline criteria revises the Rotterdam criteria and now recommends diagnosis in adults to be based on the presence of 2 of 3 features: oligo/amenorrhea, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). For adolescents, a diagnosis requires both oligo/amenorrhea and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism.

PCOS diagnosis requires the exclusion of mimicking disorders that can result in ovulatory dysfunction and/or hyperandrogenism. Clinical evaluation should consider Cushing syndrome, androgen-secreting neoplasms, syndromes of severe insulin resistance and lipodystrophy, and acromegaly. Laboratory investigations should include the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to exclude thyroid disorders, prolactin to exclude hyperprolactinemia, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), obtained basally and in the pre-ovulatory or follicular phase of the menstrual cycle to exclude 21-hydroxylase deficient non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH), given that NCAH is unable to be distinguished clinically from PCOS. A diagnostic algorithm is presented in Fig. 1.

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^4c6e837c]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has drastic, lifelong consequences for a woman’s health and wellbeing. Androgen excess is the most common endocrinopathy of PCOS, with > 80% prevalence. Newly published International Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of PCOS endorse a clinical diagnosis requiring at least 2 out of the following 3 (Rotterdam) criteria: (i) high circulating levels of testosterone (T) or excessive body hair (hirsutism); (ii) intermittent or absent menstrual cycles; (iii) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, provided that related, but distinctly different, endocrine disorders have been excluded. Rotterdam criteria generate 4 PCOS phenotypes: Classic PCOS with type A, hyperandrogenism or hirsutism (HA) + intermittent/absent cycles (ovulatory dysfunction, OD) + polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and type B, HA + OD; type C, HA + PCOM; and type D, OD + PCOM. Phenotype B, however, may eventually be reassigned to Type A when three-dimensional ovarian imaging and standardized anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) assays become widely available, enabling accurate characterization of a woman’s ovarian follicle population.

Epidemiology

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age,with a prevalence of 4-21% depending on the diagnostic criteria used.A systematic review of 13 studies found a slightly higher estimate of the prevalence in black and Middle-Eastern than in Chinese and white populations,although inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria and recruitment methods make comparisons between ethnic groups challenging.The global disease burden seems to be increasing at a high rate. In 2019, an age standardised point prevalence of 1677.8 per 100 000 and an annual incidence of 59.8 per 100 000 population were reported based on data from 204 countries, representing increases of 30.4% and 29.5%, respectively, since 1990.The rising incidence, and accompanying morbidity,emphasises the importance of recognising polycystic ovary syndrome as an international public health priority.
