## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiological mechanism is responsible for acute chest syndrome in a 30-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia who presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, and a wedge-shaped consolidation on chest X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition and diagnostic criteria for acute chest syndrome. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology that links sickling to lung injury. Next, I will examine each answer choice against established mechanisms and the imaging clue. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best option, making sure I don't over-attribute to infection or parenchymal infiltration when the primary driver is vascular occlusion and ischemia [^112mp51a] [^113LXhaY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its imaging hallmark. Acute chest syndrome is defined by new respiratory symptoms or fever plus a new pulmonary infiltrate involving at least one lung segment, with radiographic consolidation that is not merely atelectasis, which fits the wedge-shaped consolidation described in the vignette [^114a9MeV] [^11579bh7]. Hold on, I should verify the timing too: ACS often follows a vaso-occlusive crisis by 1–3 days, reinforcing a vascular-occlusion mechanism rather than a purely infectious process, although infection can be contributory in some cases [^113EdLXJ].

> Now, I need to check the fundamental pathophysiology. The proximate cause is vaso-occlusion by sickled erythrocytes within the pulmonary microvasculature, producing regional hypoperfusion, ischemia, and secondary inflammation and consolidation; this is the canonical mechanism across authoritative reviews and guidelines, and it aligns with the clinical-radiographic picture here [^112mp51a] [^113LXhaY]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overstating infection as primary; while infection can trigger or coexist, the unifying mechanism that produces the infiltrate and hypoxemia in ACS is vascular obstruction by sickled RBCs leading to ischemic injury [^112mp51a] [^113LXhaY].

> I will now examine Option A, which claims increased RBC destruction causes tissue ischemia. Hmm, wait a minute — hemolysis is indeed a feature of SCD, but hemolysis per se does not directly occlude vessels; rather, it contributes to anemia and NO depletion, which can worsen hypoxia and vasoconstriction, indirectly promoting sickling and vaso-occlusion, so this option misattributes the direct mechanism of ischemia in ACS [^11393FXp] [^114jk7gL]. I should double-check: the direct cause of ischemia in ACS is microvascular obstruction by sickled RBCs, not hemolysis itself, so Option A is not the best answer [^112mp51a].

> Next, I should review Option B, which proposes infiltration of small blood vessels by sickled RBCs with mechanical trauma. This matches the established vaso-occlusion model: rigid, sickled RBCs adhere to endothelium and to each other, mechanically obstructing small pulmonary vessels and causing downstream ischemia and infarction, which explains the wedge-shaped consolidation consistent with pulmonary infarction on imaging [^112mp51a] [^111Nw4Ci]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is exactly the mechanism that ties the vignette's findings together, and it remains the most accurate and specific choice among the options provided [^112mp51a].

> Let me consider Option C, which suggests infiltration of the lung parenchyma by sickled RBCs. I need to ensure I'm precise here: sickled RBCs do not typically infiltrate alveolar parenchyma; they occlude microvessels, and the consolidation reflects secondary alveolar injury, hemorrhage, or edema from ischemia, not direct parenchymal infiltration by RBCs, so this wording is misleading and anatomically inaccurate for the primary mechanism [^112mp51a]. Hold on, I should verify — yes, the correct emphasis is on vascular occlusion rather than parenchymal infiltration by RBCs, so Option C is incorrect [^112mp51a].

> I will now examine Option D, impaired hemoglobin synthesis causing ineffective erythropoiesis. Wait, let me verify — this describes thalassemia pathophysiology, not sickle cell disease; in SCD, the problem is abnormal hemoglobin structure (HbS) with hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, not reduced synthesis of globin chains, so this option is fundamentally mismatched to the disease biology in question [^11393FXp] [^114DTsWo]. I should confirm — yes, this is a distractor based on a different hemoglobinopathy mechanism, making Option D incorrect here.

> Next, I should review Option E, iron accumulation causing fibrosis. Hold on, I should verify the timeline — iron overload in SCD is typically a chronic transfusion-related complication leading to fibrosis over years, not the acute mechanism behind a new wedge-shaped consolidation in ACS; therefore, this does not explain the acute pathophysiology of ACS in this vignette [^111ATtxq]. Let me reconsider — this option conflates chronic parenchymal injury with an acute vascular-occlusion syndrome, so it is not appropriate for the question asked.

> Synthesizing this, the best answer is Option B, because ACS results from microvascular obstruction of pulmonary vessels by sickled RBCs, producing ischemia and infarction that manifest clinically with chest pain, dyspnea, and radiographically as a new consolidation, which fits the vignette's wedge-shaped infiltrate and symptom complex [^112mp51a] [^111Nw4Ci]. I should double-check that I've addressed the distractors adequately — Options A, C, D, and E either misstate the direct mechanism or describe unrelated processes, leaving Option B as the most accurate and specific choice.

The correct answer is **B) Infiltration of small blood vessels by sickled red blood cells and mechanical trauma**. Acute chest syndrome in sickle cell anemia is primarily due to **vaso-occlusion of pulmonary microvessels** by sickled erythrocytes, causing ischemia, infarction, and secondary inflammation [^11393FXp] [^114a9MeV]. This mechanical blockage leads to hypoxemia, chest pain, and the wedge-shaped consolidation seen on imaging [^113LXhaY]. Options A, C, D, and E describe mechanisms not directly responsible for ACS pathophysiology.

## Pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome

ACS is a **multifactorial process** characterized by:

- **Vaso-occlusion**: Sickled RBCs obstruct pulmonary microvessels, causing ischemia and infarction [^11393FXp] [^112mp51a].
- **Inflammation**: Ischemia triggers inflammation, further increasing vascular permeability and edema [^116BYVmY].
- **Infection**: Often a precipitant, with pathogens like Mycoplasma pneumoniae implicated [^111Nw4Ci].
- **Fat embolism**: Bone marrow emboli from vaso-occlusive crises can occlude pulmonary vessels [^111Nw4Ci].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Chest pain**: From ischemia and infarction [^114wu9op].
- **Dyspnea and tachypnea**: From hypoxemia and impaired gas exchange [^115XnfEq].
- **Fever and cough**: Often from secondary infection or inflammation [^113LXhaY].
- **Hypoxemia**: Reduced oxygen saturation due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching [^notfound].

---

## Radiological findings

Chest imaging commonly shows **wedge-shaped consolidation** reflecting pulmonary infarction from vascular occlusion [^notfound]. Other findings include **pleural effusions**, **atelectasis**, and **multilobar infiltrates** [^111Nw4Ci].

---

## Differential diagnosis

ACS must be distinguished from:

- **Pneumonia**: Infection causing consolidation [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Thrombotic occlusion of pulmonary arteries [^notfound].
- **Asthma exacerbation**: Bronchospasm and inflammation [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary hemorrhage**: Bleeding into lung parenchyma [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management includes:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Maintain SpO2 > 95% [^115cuFsa].
- **Antibiotics**: Cover atypical pathogens [^115cuFsa].
- **Transfusion**: Simple or exchange to reduce sickling [^113YobkJ].
- **Supportive care**: Analgesia, hydration, and monitoring [^113YobkJ].

---

## Conclusion

ACS in sickle cell anemia is primarily due to **vaso-occlusion of pulmonary microvessels** by sickled RBCs, causing ischemia, infarction, and secondary inflammation [^112mp51a]. This mechanical blockage explains the clinical and radiographic features of ACS [^notfound].

### Crises in sickle cell disease [^114wu9op]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In spite of significant strides in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), SCD crises are still responsible for high morbidity and early mortality. While most patients initially seek care in the acute setting for a seemingly uncomplicated pain episode (pain crisis or vaso-occlusive crisis), this initial event is the primary risk factor for potentially life-threatening complications. The pathophysiological basis of these illnesses is end-organ ischemia and infarction combined with the downstream effects of hemolysis that results from red blood cell sickling. These pathological changes can occur acutely and lead to a dramatic clinical presentation, but are frequently superimposed over a milieu of chronic vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and decreased functional reserve. In the lungs, acute chest syndrome is a particularly ominous lung injury syndrome with a complex pathogenesis and potentially devastating sequelae, but all organ systems can be affected. It is, therefore, critical to understand the SCD patients' susceptibility to acute complications and their risk factors so that they can be recognized promptly and managed effectively. Blood transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy for all severe acute crises. Recommendations and indications for the safest and most efficient implementation of transfusion strategies in the critical care setting are therefore presented and discussed, together with their pitfalls and potential future therapeutic alternatives. In particular, the importance of extended phenotypic red blood cell matching cannot be overemphasized, due to the high prevalence of severe complications from red cell alloimmunization in SCD.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) definition and research priorities — ACS is a clinical syndrome consisting of chest pain, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough plus a new infiltrative finding at least one lung segment and is a leading acute cause of mortality in this population. Diagnosis relies on radiographic abnormalities that may precede or lag behind symptoms, and radiography may be unavailable in low-resource settings. Incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crisis decreases ACS risk, but additional preventive approaches are necessary. Priority areas for research include ACS severity and subtypes, primary and secondary prevention, and management in low-resource settings.

### Inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^114jk7gL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome has been defined as a new infiltrate visible on chest radiograph associated with one or more symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum production, tachypnea, dyspnea, or new-onset hypoxia. Symptoms and complications of this syndrome, whether of infectious or non-infectious origin, vary quite widely in people with sickle cell disease. Lung infection tends to predominate in children, whilst infarction appears more common in adults. However, these are often interrelated and may occur concurrently. The differences in clinical course and severity are suggestive of multiple causes for acute chest syndrome. Successful treatment depends principally on high-quality supportive care. The syndrome and its treatment have been extensively studied, but the response to antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other conventional therapies remains disappointing. The potential of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment option has more recently provoked considerable interest. Nitric oxide appears to play a major role in both the regulation of vascular muscle tone at the cellular level and in platelet aggregation (clumping). Much of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease is consistent with a mechanism of nitric oxide depletion and although there has been extensive research on the pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome, the possible therapeutic role of inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease is still to be determined.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care.

Search Strategy

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In July 2007 the following clinical trials registers were searched: ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch/); Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com/) and CLINICALTRIALS.COM (www.clinicaltrials.com/). Most recent search of the Trials Register: November 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome, comparing the use of inhaled nitric oxide to placebo or standard care for any single or multiple treatment and over any time period.

Data Collection and Analysis

No studies identified were eligible for inclusion.

Main Results

No studies identified were eligible for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a need for well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of this form of treatment as an adjunct to established therapies.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^11579bh7]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD), described for the first time by Herrick in 1910, is an autosomal recessively inherited genetic disorder caused by a single point mutation in the gene encoding the β-globin chain of hemoglobin. It is the most widespread and severe monogenetic disorder in the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it represents a real public health hazard with 1 to 4% of babies born affected. SCD is associated with multiple acute and chronic complications such as painful vaso-occlusive events, cerebral vasculopathy, priapism, chronic kidney disease, acute chest syndrome (ACS) and pulmonary hypertension among others.

ACS is an acute lung injury syndrome that occurs frequently in patients with SCD. Indeed, it is the second most common cause of hospitalization, and the leading cause of death, contributing to almost 25% of SCD-related mortality. Moreover, nearly half of deaths due to ACS occur in SCD patients less than 20 years of age. Repeated episodes of ACS negatively impact long-term lung function, resulting thereby in chronic lung diseases.

ACS is currently defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray consistent with alveolar consolidation but not atelectasis, in conjunction with at least one of the following clinical findings: fever (> 38.5 °C), reduced oxygen saturation or PaO 2 (< 60 mmHg), tachypnea, intercostal retractions, nasal flaring or accessory muscle use, chest pain, cough, wheeze or rales. In 1979, Charache et al. first suggested using the term "acute chest syndrome" for this complication, acknowledging the difficulties in determining its pathogenesis. Till nowadays, the pathophysiology of ACS remains not fully elucidated, yet multiple risk factors have been identified including: male sex, younger age, higher steady-state of leukocyte counts and hemoglobin level, lower hemoglobin F (HbF) concentrations, previous history of ACS, history of asthma, active smoking or environmental smoke exposure. Furthermore, ACS may be more severe in individuals with HbSS as compared with HbSC disease.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^113YobkJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of ACS in SCD, including diagnosis and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

ACS is defined by respiratory symptoms and/or fever and a new radiodensity on chest imaging in a patient with SCD. There are a variety of inciting causes, including infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Although ACS is more common in those with homozygous SCD, clinicians should consider ACS in all SCD patients, as ACS is a leading cause of death in SCD. Patients typically present with or develop respiratory symptoms including fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, which can progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in 20% of adult patients. However, the initial presentation can vary. While the first line imaging modality is classically chest radiograph, lung ultrasound has demonstrated promise. Further imaging to include computed tomography may be necessary. Management focuses on analgesia, oxygen supplementation, incentive spirometry, bronchodilators, rehydration, antibiotics, consideration for transfusion, and specialist consultation. Empiric antibiotics that cover atypical pathogens are necessary along with measures to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in those with hypoxemia such as simple transfusion or exchange transfusion.

Conclusions

An understanding of ACS can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

ACS severity and subtypes — Research question: Which criteria should be used to classify ACS as mild, moderate, or severe? The umbrella term ACS describes distinct phenotypes, with rapidly progressive ACS associated with multiorgan failure and death appearing distinct from milder ACS that improves with antibiotics and supportive care. A retrospective study of 173 children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) found that, in adults, thrombocytopenia was the only predictor of rapidly progressive ACS. Additional biomarkers should be evaluated for potential prediction of ACS development and progression, and ACS phenotype severity classifications should be explicitly defined and categorized by acuity and severity and identifiable pathophysiology allowing for targeted therapies.

### The intersection between asthma and acute chest syndrome in children with sickle-cell anaemia [^112m5M3v]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Acute chest syndrome is a frequent cause of acute lung disease in children with sickle-cell disease. Asthma is common in children with sickle-cell disease and is associated with increased incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome episodes, and earlier death. Risk factors for asthma exacerbation and an acute chest syndrome episode are similar, and both can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and wheezing. Despite overlapping risk factors and symptoms, an acute exacerbation of asthma or an episode of acute chest syndrome are two distinct entities that need disease-specific management strategies. Although understanding has increased about asthma as a comorbidity in sickle-cell disease and its effects on morbidity, substantial gaps remain in knowledge about best management.

Management of ACS in low-resource settings — Research question: How should patients with acute onset of signs and symptoms concerning for ACS be managed in low-resource settings? Supporting questions include which physical signs and symptoms are most indicative of ACS in settings without chest radiography and which sustainable interventions decrease ACS-related maternal mortality where hematologists and transfusion therapy are not uniformly available. ACS is a common cause of hospitalization in SCD in high-resource settings, but in many low-resource regions where SCD is highly prevalent, chest radiographs are unavailable.

Sickle cell disease with acute chest pain — patients with sickle cell disease who are experiencing chest pain require prompt evaluation, and in those with suspected acute chest syndrome (ACS), emergency transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended and ACS should be excluded. In patients with sickle cell disease who experience chest pain, ACS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates; these patients should be transferred to an acute care setting by EMS when there is clinical suspicion of ACS. The recommended diagnostic evaluation for adults with a presentation concerning for acute chest syndrome includes an ECG, troponin test, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, reticulocyte count, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph, and blood and sputum cultures.

### Diffuse cystic lung disease in sickle cell anaemia: a series of 22 cases and a case-control study [^1153zgmv]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic interstitial lung abnormalities have been described in sickle cell disease (SCD) and attributed to repetitive episode of acute chest syndrome. We report a series of 22 cases of diffuse cystic lung disease in SCD with a case-control study to hunt for mechanism. On pathological analysis of a surgical lung biopsy of the index case, the bronchioles had the appearance of constrictive bronchiolitis. Pulmonary function test results revealed lower forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of vital capacity in cases versus controls. These findings suggest a bronchiolar mechanism that was not associated with more acute chest syndrome.

### Pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease [^112ZwijV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common monogenetic disorder with high associated morbidity and mortality. The pulmonary complications of SCD are of particular importance, as acute chest syndrome and pulmonary hypertension have the highest associated mortality rates within this population. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of clinically significant pulmonary manifestations of SCD, including acute chest syndrome, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension in adult and pediatric patients. Clinicians should be vigilant in screening and treating such comorbidities to improve patient outcomes.

### Pulmonary complications of hemoglobinopathies [^114DTsWo]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are diseases caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal, dysfunctional hemoglobin molecules or lower levels of normal hemoglobin molecules. The most common hemoglobinopathies are sickle cell disease (SCD) and the thalassemias. In SCD, an abnormal hemoglobin alters the erythrocyte, causing a chronic hemolytic anemia, which can lead to pulmonary parenchymal damage and impaired vascular function. Pulmonary complications of SCD include the acute chest syndrome (ACS), reactive airways disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and pulmonary fibrosis. Episodes of ACS and the development of PH both increase the risk of death in patients with SCD. Both α and β thalassemia are characterized by impaired production of hemoglobin subunits, and severity of disease varies widely. Although screening studies suggest that PH is a common complication for patients with thalassemia, its impact on survival is unknown. Understanding the pathogenesis, diagnostic options, and prevention and treatment strategies for such complications is critical for clinicians who care for these patients. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and clinical presentation of pulmonary complications associated with hemoglobinopathies, with a focus on recent advances in pathogenesis and treatment.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1134ucao]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society (ATS) sickle cell lung disease workshop — scope and priorities emphasize that sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy associated with early mortality, that pulmonary-related morbidity remains a high burden across the lifespan, and that cardiopulmonary complications are a major risk factor for death; expanding knowledge of lung disease is crucial to improving patient outcomes and this report serves to disseminate findings to the medical community. To address these challenges and frame a research agenda, an expert panel identified key unanswered research questions in acute chest syndrome (ACS), lower airways disease and pulmonary function, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and hypoxemia, and pulmonary vascular complications in SCD.

### Management of severe acute chest syndrome in a patient with a history of severe delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction [^117V32vi]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A case of a patient in her 30s with sickle cell anaemia who developed multiorgan failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) from acute chest syndrome (ACS) despite a simple red blood cell transfusion is presented in this report. She was treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) due to a history of severe delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction and a lack of available compatible units of packed red blood cells. Following one session of PLEX with half plasma/half albumin, she had rapid clinical improvement from mechanical ventilation to room air in 5days. This finding is consistent with existing case reports of rapid improvement in pain, oxygenation and organ function following PLEX. Proposed mechanisms include the modulation of rheological properties of red blood cells by plasma, as well as the removal of the cytotoxic effects of haptoglobin and haemopexin. This case demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of an alternative upfront approach to managing complications related to ACS in those who are heavily alloimmunised.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^1141HXKC]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ACS is frequent among SCD children in our milieu. Its etiologies seem to be multifactorial including infection, pulmonary thrombosis and fat embolism. After an initial normal chest x-ray, especially in a patient presenting with VOC, repeated clinical evaluation must be conducted and possible changes in the clinical status should indicate the necessity of a new radiographic examination. Patients' parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to correctly diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences. Additive treatment such as incentive spirometry, bronchodilators and even low dose dexamethasone could perhaps be introduced in our settings to reduce the hospital stay and hasten recovery. On recovery, treatment with hydroxyurea should be discussed to reduce the likelihood of recurrent episodes.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy associated with extensive morbidity and early mortality. While there have been recent improvements in available disease-modifying therapies for SCD, cardiopulmonary complications remain a major risk factor for death in this population. We provide an overview of current knowledge regarding several of the major acute and chronic cardiopulmonary complications in SCD, including: acute chest syndrome, airway disease, lung function abnormalities, nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep disordered breathing, pulmonary vascular disease, and sickle cell cardiomyopathy.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115QBwvR]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) are highlighted with methods and research priorities: Pulmonary complications of SCD are diverse and encompass acute and chronic disease, the understanding of their natural history is limited, no specific therapies exist, and these complications are a primary cause of morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary group of pediatric and adult hematologists, pulmonologists, and emergency medicine physicians with expertise in SCD-related lung disease, along with an SCD patient advocate, reviewed the literature and identified key unanswered clinical and research questions, organizing into four subcommittees (acute chest syndrome; lower airways disease and pulmonary function; sleep-disordered breathing and hypoxia; pulmonary vascular complications). Clinically important questions were developed after literature review and finalized by group discussion and consensus. Current knowledge is based on small, predominantly observational studies, few multicenter longitudinal studies, and even fewer high-quality interventional trials targeting pulmonary complications of SCD; each subcommittee identified the three or four most important unanswered questions in their topic area. The authors conclude that important and clinically relevant questions remain unanswered and that high-quality, multicenter, longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials designed and implemented by teams of multidisciplinary clinician-investigators are needed to improve the care of individuals with SCD.

### Ischemia-reperfusion injury in sickle cell anemia: relationship to acute chest syndrome, endothelial dysfunction, arterial vasculopathy, and inflammatory pain [^116BYVmY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) physiology, also called reperfusion injury, instigates vascular and tissue injury in human disease states. This review describes why sickle cell anemia should be conceptualized in this fashion and how I/R physiology explains the genesis of characteristic aspects of vascular pathobiology and clinical disease in sickle cell anemia. The nature of I/R and its relevance to sickle cell anemia are discussed, with an emphasis on the acute chest syndrome, endothelial dysfunction with aberrant vasoregulation, circle of Willis vasculopathy, and inflammatory pain. Viewing sickle disease from this perspective elucidates defining pathophysiology and identifies a host of novel potential therapeutic targets.

Primary and secondary prevention of ACS — Research question: Which patients are at increased risk for ACS and may benefit from primary or secondary prevention? ACS often occurs 1 to 3 days after hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs), though it can present independently of a painful episode. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, and chronic transfusions decrease ACS frequency but do not prevent all episodes. Some clinicians use early blood transfusion or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in patients at high risk for ACS, and the ideal timing and type of transfusion and the efficacy of NIV to decrease progression should be tested in intervention trials. Systemic steroids may reduce the severity and/or duration of an ACS episode, but some studies and anecdotal observations suggest an increased risk of rehospitalization for a VOE. Pharmacologic prevention strategies, including inhaled corticosteroids and novel medications such as crizanlizumab, should be evaluated in large randomized trials; agents targeting erythrocyte sickling, hemolysis, fat embolism, and thrombosis should be investigated. Preventive measures against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as low–tidal–volume ventilation, should be evaluated as preventive measures for ACS in patients with SCD.

### Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report [^116n9T9y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital.

Conclusions

This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.

### Role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^112mp51a]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) of sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized pathologically by vaso-occlusive processes that result from abnormal interactions between sickle red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and/or platelets, and the vascular endothelium. One potential mechanism of vascular damage in ACS is by generation of oxygen-related molecules, such as superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and the hydroxyl (*OH) radical. The present review summarizes the evidence for alterations in oxidant stress during ACS of SCD, and the potential contributions of RBCs, WBCs and the vascular endothelium to this process.

### Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: the relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission [^116keNvm]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data on acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study, we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes (time to onset ≤ 24h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (> 24h, 58%; median [interquartile range] time to onset: 2 [2–3] days). The median age was 27 [22–34] years, 89% of the patients had an S/S or S/β 0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had a history of ACS (median: 3 [2–5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively 54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for 20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^1114eSJS]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of ACS is multifactorial. The three primary studied mechanisms include pneumonia or systemic infection, fat embolism, and direct pulmonary infarction from HbS-containing erythrocytes. The management of this condition is still largely determined by the experience of individual practitioners, and currently there are no conclusive randomized controlled clinical trials to guide therapy. The most common therapy includes nonspecific supportive care strategies aimed at hastening recovery to baseline, including: hospitalization, hydration, analgesics, broad-spectrum antibiotics, bronchodilators, incentive spirometry, supplemental oxygen, and blood transfusions.

Although SSA is particularly affected by SCD, there is paucity of data on this topic in the region, specifically targeting the magnitude of SCD-related complications. This study was thus undertaken, aiming at determining the burden of ACS and describing its clinical and therapeutic aspects among SCD children in a SSA tertiary pediatric health care facility.

### Low forced expiratory volume is associated with earlier death in sickle cell anemia [^1171t4jL]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications result in mortality in adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA). We tested the hypothesis that abnormal pulmonary function was associated with earlier death. A prospective cohort of adults with SCA, followed in the Cooperative Study for Sickle Cell Disease, was constructed using the first pulmonary function test at > 21 years of age. Spirometry measures: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity, and total lung capacity were categorized based on age, gender, height, and race. Pulmonary function patterns were categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines using both spirometry and lung volumes. A cohort of 430 adults with SCA, mean age 32.6 ± 9.5 (range, 21.0–67.8) years at time of first pulmonary function test, and a median follow-up of 5.5 years, was evaluated. A total of 63 deaths occurred. At baseline, 47% had normal, 29% restrictive, 8% obstructive, 2% mixed, and 14% nonspecific lung function patterns. In the final multivariable model, lower FEV1 percent predicted was associated with increased hazard ratio of death (HR per % predicted 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.04; p = 0.037), as was older age (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04–1.10; P < .001), male sex (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.20–3.65; p = 0.010), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (HR per mg/dL 1.002; 95% CI 1.00–1.003; p = 0.015), and higher acute chest syndrome incidence rate (HR per event/year 10.4; 95% CI 3.11–34.8; P < .001). Presence of obstructive (HR 1.18; 95% CI: 0.44–3.20; p = 0.740) and restrictive (HR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.64–2.32; p = 0.557) pulmonary function patterns were not associated with earlier death. Understanding the pathophysiology of a low FEV1 percent predicted in individuals with SCA is warranted, enabling early intervention for those at risk.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious monogenic disorder that reduces life expectancy. The acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the most frequent condition requiring hospitalization in SCD patients, often with an infectious event as the initial cause, and the leading cause of death among SCD adult patients. Consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known, with only a few case reports, including one non-severe case in a 21‐year‐old man hospitalized with a history of SCD (HbS/β0‐thalassemia) on maintenance hydroxyurea therapy; a series of four clinical cases of patients from 22 to 41 years old with ACS; two cases of ACS. Another case describes a patient with pneumonia and severe ACS successfully treated with Tocilizumab. None of these patients was reported to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

### COVID-19 and sickle cell disease [^116oDkMQ]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The Amsterdam University Medical Centers reported two Hb SS patients who presented with typical acute sickle pain with no accompanying flu-like symptoms. A 24- year-old male presented with acute thoracic pain in the absence of fever or dyspnea; throat and nose swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and the patient received the presumptive diagnosis of a vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) complicated by ACS. He received antibiotic therapy and was discharged home only to return 24 hours later with increasing pain, dyspnea, and fever. Repeat chest imaging demonstrated progression of infiltrates but radiologic findings were not consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. A repeat PCR performed on a sputum sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient received appropriate supportive treatment and had an uneventful recovery. Patient 2, a 20-year-old female presented with an acute pain crisis. She developed transient hypoxia and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive. Although CT imaging of the chest did not demonstrate pulmonary abnormalities, she was hospitalized for pain management and never developed respiratory symptoms or fever. We have not been informed if these patients were on hydroxyurea or regular blood transfusion programs.

Although anecdotal, a few important themes emerge from these cases – that COVID-19 might trigger a VOC without the accompanying respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, that ACS is not as common a complication as feared, and that fever was notably absent at presentation in some SCD patients, a feature also noted among 5,700 patients admitted with COVID-19 in New York City.

### Rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome in individuals with sickle cell anemia: a distinct acute chest syndrome phenotype [^112FoKFP]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Current definitions of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell anemia (SCA) do not account for rapid progression of respiratory compromise. In this two-center retrospective cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that in children and adults with ACS and respiratory failure (≤ 24 hours after onset of respiratory symptoms) have a distinct ACS phenotype associated with multiorgan failure when compared to those with ACS that have a more subacute and protracted course. We identified 173 individuals (97 children < 20 years and 76 adults ≥ 20 years) with SCA and at least one episode of ACS. Only one ACS episode was considered per individual. Rapidly progressive ACS occurred in 21% (n = 16) of adults, but only 2.1% (n = 2) of children. Compared to adults without rapidly progressive ACS, adults with rapidly progressive ACS more frequently developed acute kidney injury (68.8% vs. 3.3%, P < 0.001), hepatic dysfunction (75.0% vs. 15.0%, P < 0.001), altered mental status (43.8% vs. 11.7%, P < 0.001), multiorgan failure (93.8% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), and death (6.3% vs. 0%, P = 0.05). Clinical and laboratory covariates that were evaluable on the first day of respiratory symptoms were evaluated to identify predictors of rapidly progressive ACS. On multivariable analysis, decline in platelet count at presentation was the only predictor of rapidly progressive ACS [odds ratio 4.82 (95% CI 1.20–19.39), P = 0.027]. In conclusion, rapidly progressive ACS is a distinct phenotype that occurs more frequently in adults, is preceded by thrombocytopenia, and is associated with multiorgan failure. Am. J.

### Acute myocardial infarction in a young man with sickle cell disease [^114Lod7V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is considered protective against large vessel coronary artery disease. Although sickle cell patients do develop myocardial degeneration and fibrosis at a higher rate than age-matched controls, they rarely suffer from an acute myocardial infarction. We present a case of a 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease who presented with an acute non-ST segment myocardial infarction. In sickle cell patients who present with chest pain as an element of their sickle cell crisis, the clinician must consider acute myocardial infarction in the differential along with more common entities like acute chest syndrome.

### Pulmonary platelet thrombi and vascular pathology in acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease [^113pzeWM]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease triggered by a point mutation in the β‐globin chain of hemoglobin resulting in a glutamic acid in the sixth position of the β‐chain instead of valine (HbS). This illness is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting ∼100,000 people in the US alone 1. There are an estimated 300,000 births per year worldwide (WHO).

One of the leading causes of death in patients is acute chest syndrome (ACS) 2. The pulmonary manifestations of ACS can appear suddenly, and often progress rapidly to fatality. There are multiple identified etiologies associated with the development of ACS including infection, fat or pulmonary embolism, or opiate intoxication 3. In most cases, the cause cannot be attributed to a single agent, and if so it is likely determined authoritatively only at autopsy.

One potential commonality is that an acute pain event usually precedes the onset of ACS 3. Although clearly much remains to be learned, acute pain events are one of the better characterized aspects of SCD. In most cases, there is an increase in inflammatory markers and indicators of endothelial dysfunction 4, 5. Platelet activation increases during pain events, as do platelet‐derived markers of inflammation 6. In fact, platelets are emerging as potentially pivotal contributors to the overall inflammatory state of patients 7. Hemolysis is a defined activator of platelets 8, 9, 10, as is certain bacterial infections 11. Inflammatory factors from the α‐granules of platelets such as CD40L and thrombospondin circulate at higher levels in patients with SCD. These levels increase further as patients enter acute events 12, 13.

Changes in platelet count are also associated with acute clinical events, including ACS 14. Patients with SCD, even at steady state typically have higher platelet counts than those without the illness 15. However, platelet count typically drops during acute events 14, 15, and in some cases thrombocytopenia can occur in ACS 2. This drop in platelet count is usually attributed to platelet adhesion and sequestration in the vasculature. Although platelet activation increases during the acute events, the mechanism through which this sequestration may occur is also understudied. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the decrease in platelet count is predictive of neurological outcome in ACS 2, so there is clearly merit in exploring the role of platelets during this life‐threatening event in patients with SCD.

### Lung function in sickle cell disease [^115KDkdj]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Although some of the most severe complications of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) tend to be acute and severe (e.g. acute chest syndrome, stroke etc.), the chronic ones can be equally debilitating. Prominent among them is the effect that the disease has on lung growth and function. For many years the traditional teaching has been that SCD is associated with the development of a restrictive lung defect. However, there is increasing evidence that this is not a universal finding and that at least during childhood and adolescence, the majority of the patients have a normal or obstructive pattern of lung function. The following article reviews the current knowledge on the effects of SCD on lung growth and function. Special emphasis is given to the controversies among the published articles in the literature and discusses possible causes for these discrepancies.

### Bedside ultrasound as a predictive tool for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell patients [^1162v9Py]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of death for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Early recognition of ACS improves prognosis.

Objective

Investigate the use of bedside lung ultrasound (BLU) in identification of early pulmonary findings associated with ACS in SCD patients.

Methods

Prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of SCD patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for a pain crisis. BLU interpretations were made by an emergency physician blinded to the diagnosis of ACS, and were validated by a second reviewer. The electronic medical record was reviewed at discharge and at 30 days.

Results

Twenty SCD patients were enrolled. Median age was 31 years, median hemoglobin was 7.7 g/dL. Six patients developed ACS. Five patients in the ACS group had lung consolidations on BLU (83%) compared to 3 patients in the non-ACS group (21%), p = 0.0181, (OR = 12.05, 95% CI 1.24 to 116.73). The ACS group was also more likely to have a pleural effusion and B-lines on BLU than the non-ACS group, p = 0.0175; 0.1657, respectively. In the ACS group, peripheral and frank consolidations on BLU was 83% and 50% sensitive, 79% and 100% specific for ACS, respectively; whereas an infiltrate on initial chest X-ray (CXR) was only 17% sensitive. BLU identified lung abnormalities sooner than CXR (median 3.6 vs. 31.8 h).

Conclusions

Pulmonary abnormalities on BLU of an adult SCD patient presenting to the ED for a painful crisis appear before CXR, and highly suggest ACS. BLU is a promising predictive tool for ACS.

### Opportunities to improve outcomes in sickle cell disease [^111ATtxq]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease represents a spectrum of inherited hemoglobin disorders. The pathophysiology involves abnormalities not just in red blood cells but also vascular endothelium, white blood cell function, coagulation, and inflammatory response. Known sequelae of sickle cell disease include invasive infections, painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, strokes, and chronic pulmonary hypertension. Preventive strategies that decrease the risk of infection are the routine use of daily antibiotics until five years of age, immunization of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in addition to the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, annual influenza vaccination after six months of age, and meningococcal vaccination after two years of age. A significant advance in stroke prevention is the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to identify asymptomatic, at-risk children who should be considered for chronic blood transfusions. Chronic transfusion therapy for primary or secondary stroke prevention requires careful surveillance for iron overload and chelation therapy. Patients with chest pain, fever, or respiratory symptoms and new pulmonary infiltrates require aggressive medical management for acute chest syndrome. Pain management still represents an important area for aggressive treatment using sickle cell disease-specific guidelines. Newer treatments include hydroxyurea therapy to decrease the frequency of painful episodes and associated comorbidities, and hematopoietic cell transplantation for a limited subset of patients. Family physicians play a crucial role in instituting evidence-based preventive care strategies, initiating timely treatment of acute illness, recognizing life-threatening episodes, and providing a medical home for multidisciplinary management.

### Fatal 1918 pneumonia case complicated by erythrocyte sickling [^117AzKGS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell trait has been occasionally associated with debilitating illness and death. Pulmonary complications associated with sickle cell trait include venous thromboembolic disease, sickle chest syndrome, and pulmonary infarction, which recently prompted US college officials to screen athletes for sickle cell trait. We speculate that the clinical severity and rapid development of acute bacterial pneumonia in the patient reported here led to profound terminal hypoxemia, which led in turn to erythrocyte sickling. The postmortem gross evidence of necrotic areas in the lung and spleen and hemorrhages in the kidneys is clearly consistent with sickled erythrocytes causing vascular congestion and infarction, thus contributing to the patient's death.

### Acute pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease [^113fgRPo]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary problems in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, in particular acute chest syndrome (ACS), cause significant mortality and morbidity. It is important to differentiate ACS from pneumonia to avoid inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Asthma may increase the risk of ACS and co-morbid asthma and SCD are associated with worse patient outcomes and, in preclinical models, more severe inflammation. Recurrent wheezing, however, can occur in the absence of a diagnosis of asthma; it is likely due to SCD related inflammation and additional therapies than those that treat asthma may be required. Further research is merited to clarify these issues.

Summary of quantitative variables

According to our patients' parents, duration of evolution of symptoms before consultation ranged from less than 24 h to almost 14 days, with a mean of 4.8 (4.2) days. The presenting complaints are reported in Table 3. The three main symptoms were fever (90.5%), cough (81%), and chest pains (28.6%). The main clinical signs we observed were pulmonary consolidation (100%), an altered general appearance (61.9%), clinical signs of anemia (57.1%), a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (57.1%), and signs of respiratory distress (33.3%). Two patients (9.5%) who were initially admitted for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) developed ACS after 2 days of hospitalization. Results of biological tests showed very high levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum CRP and serum LDH. Indeed, their mean values were 32479.4 (17862.3)/mm 3, 23476 (11543.7)/mm 3, 228.2 (132.6) mg/l, and 3452.3 (2916.3) IU/l respectively. Contrariwise, we observed relatively low levels of hemoglobin, with a mean of 6.5 (1.2) g/dl (Table 2). The main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations were the lower lobes (90.5%). None of the 10 hemocultures performed was positive, and only one of the 15 thick blood smears performed to seek for malaria parasites was positive to Plasmodium species, specifically Plasmodium falciparum (6.7%; Table 3).

### Pulmonary platelet thrombi and vascular pathology in acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease [^116skHaR]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Our data also suggest a role for platelet count as a possible predictor for those patients with ACS who have platelet thrombi in the lung. Initial platelet count was higher in those patients with the thrombi than in those without. Such clinical predictors are going to be essential in leveraging this new potential mechanism of ACS into a viable therapeutic option. It is notable that even though there was a precipitous drop in platelet count prior to death, though counts remained in the acceptable range for two of the patients. We observed no consistent change in platelet count in those patients without platelet thrombi in the lung, however.

Another possible predictor of pulmonary platelet thrombi was relatively young age which was also associated with higher platelet counts at steady state. Although all patients were adults there was a decade difference in median age between the groups. Thus the patient in late adolescence to mid‐20s might be predisposed to platelet thrombi and sequestration. We suggest, however, that platelet count is likely not sufficient to identify patients with this underlying etiology. It is likely that combination of factors, including age, platelet count, vWF modifiers, and the potentially other as yet unknown contributing factors coalesce to create this profound sequestration of platelets in the pulmonary arterial circulation. Nevertheless, these data are thus indicative of a novel pathological role of platelets in ACS and open new avenues for study and treatment.

Across "Sixteen studies… in patients with SCD", "No worsening of pulmonary function was noted…; however, the follow-up period of most studies was limited (< 5 years in most cases)". For standard therapies, "the reduction in ACS event recurrence varied from 71% to 92%", and "in a randomized phase 3 trial… reduction in ACS was seen in ~63% of patients relative to those who received placebo". The panel also noted "there is no uncertainty in the benefit of prevention of ACS and that standard of care therapies such as HU can be very effective at prevention of ACS events for some patients".

### Vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease due to 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [^1121h2Fj]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient 2, a 20‐year‐old woman with a history of frequent VOCs presented with severe pain of the back and extremities for 1 day. She had no respiratory or gastro‐intestinal complaints. Because of a dip in SpO 2 to 88% after a 100 μg parenteral fentanyl bolus in the ambulance, the suspicion of COVID‐19 rose which led to performing a chest CT and a throat and nose swab for a SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR. While the CT imaging did not show any pulmonary abnormalities, the PCR was positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. She remained hospitalized to treat her VOC without developing any respiratory symptoms.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared SARS‐CoV‐2 infection a pandemic. Severe respiratory illness occurs in approximately 15%‐20% of infected patients. 1 As of March 31, 2020, 800.049 laboratory‐confirmed cases and 38.714 deaths have been documented globally. 2 In SCD, COVID‐19 can potentially cause severe (pulmonary) complications, either by directly causing severe pneumonia or by triggering a VOC and/or ACS. While further experience regarding the clinical presentation of COVID‐19 in SCD needs to be awaited, the following important points need to be taken into consideration based on the above described patients.

Similar to what we know from other viral infections, 3, 4 SARS‐CoV‐2 can also cause ACS in SCD. Furthermore, as can be seen in patient 1, an ACS can develop without the typical pulmonary complications that can be seen with COVID‐19. Both patient 1 and especially patient 2 illustrate that COVID‐19 might trigger a VOC without the presence of flu‐like symptoms of COVID‐19. With respect to diagnosis, the history of patient 1 illustrates the low sensitivity of the PCR of the throat and nose swabs in the primary diagnosis of COVID‐19, which is estimated to be around 70%. We therefore suggest to perform a second PCR, preferably on a sputum sample, and non‐contrast chest CT imaging when there is no alternative explanation for VOC or when the clinical suspicion for COVID‐19 remains high.

Based on these two patients, at our center we decided to include SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR in the evaluation of SCD patients presenting with VOC.

### Pulmonary platelet thrombi and vascular pathology in acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease [^114LPkSa]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We present here a novel potential mechanism of ACS in patients with ACS — a massive sequestration of platelets in the pulmonary vasculature. These data suggest that anti‐platelet therapy might have application in ACS and open new avenues of thought and targeting in this too often fatal consequence of SCD.

Case presentation

Patient information

A 33-year-old man with a history of SCD and moderate overweight (BMI, 28.4 kg/m 2) presented on March 24, 2020 to the Emergency Department of Tenon hospital (a referral SCD center in Paris, France), for a febrile dyspnea. Sickle cell homozygous disease (baseline hemoglobin [Hb] value 11.5 g/dl, HbF 2.5%, HbS 87%) was known since childhood, and he had suffered mild episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis, and two episodes of ACS. Red blood cell transfusions had been required only once in the previous 20 years. Regular follow-up of SCD at our center had revealed early ophthalmological (Goldberg's stage III retinopathy) and renal (GFR 120 mL/min and microabuminuria at 0.75 g/L) damage.

Clinical findings

The symptoms first appeared 11 days before admission with cough and headache. Then, he developed fever and dyspnea. In the Emergency Room, physical examination revealed fever (39 °C) and signs of acute respiratory distress (RR 36 cycles/min, room air pulse oximetry 88%), without hemodynamic instability (BP 134/82 mmHg, HR 106/min). The patient had no history of recent medication, he reported a contact with his sick girlfriend. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates predominating in the middle lobe (Fig. 1). Blood analysis revealed moderate anemia, reticulocytopenia, moderate hemolysis, lymphocytopenia and a major inflammatory syndrome (Table 1). Respiratory condition worsened rapidly requiring intensive care unit admission and intubation with mechanical ventilation.

Pregnancy and postpartum acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease — Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased ACS risk. In low-resource settings, ACS is the most common cause of acute respiratory failure and death in pregnant or postpartum patients, with ACS responsible for > 60% of the deaths in pregnant women with sickle cell disease in this population. In Ghana, a multidisciplinary approach using a combined obstetric and hematology team was effective in reducing ACS incidence and all-cause maternal mortality. A diagnostic strategy for ACS independent of imaging could facilitate early identification and intervention allowing for targeted resource use, and the role of portable pulse oximetry devices in ACS diagnosis should be evaluated.

Sickle cell disease cardiopulmonary evaluation — Given the risk for cardiopulmonary disease in individuals with SCD, it is good practice to routinely take a targeted history for signs and symptoms that might indicate a need for further evaluation, including consideration for a diagnostic ECHO. It is good practice to consult with a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or expert in PH when interpreting results of right-heart catheterization and considering therapeutic options based on type of PH and presumed pathophysiology. It is good practice to base decisions about the need for right-heart catheterization on ECHOs obtained at steady state and not during acute illness, such as hospitalization for pain or acute chest syndrome. It is good practice to adopt a multidisciplinary (ie, hematology, PH specialist, pulmonary medicine, or cardiology) approach when considering PAH-specific therapies for SCD patients who have PAH confirmed by right-heart catheterization. It is good practice for providers to understand the importance of educating patients, discussing patient and caregiver priorities, and incorporating shared decision-making when considering obtaining PFT.

In 2 studies that examined pain and PFT in children and adults with SCD (total n = 1442), pain rates were not significantly different in individuals who underwent PFT vs those who did not; in 3 studies that examined acute chest syndrome and PFT (total n = 1564), there was no consistent relationship between acute chest syndrome and either completion of PFT screening or findings on PFT.

A 27-year-old man with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presents to the sickle cell clinic for follow-up after a screening echocardiogram revealed an increased tricuspid regurgitant velocity of 2.7 m/s. He has a history of 2 painful crises per year and has been hospitalized 3 times over the past 10 years for management of painful crises. He had one episode of acute chest syndrome at age 15 that was treated with an RBC exchange transfusion, supplemental oxygen, and intravenous antibiotics; he did not require mechanical ventilation. He has not had additional episodes of acute chest syndrome and does not have a history of stroke, retinopathy, or leg ulcers. The patient has never been treated with hydroxyurea. He wants to know whether hydroxyurea will prevent future pulmonary complications related to sickle cell disease.

Besides, we observed that radiological abnormalities of the lower lobes (90.5%) were the prevailing ones, mirroring previous findings. Contrariwise, other studies showed that the main radiological localizations of ACS were the upper lobes in children, and the lower ones in adults. While the upper lobes predominance has been associated with an infectious etiology especially in children, the lower or multi-lobes predominance has been linked to pulmonary thrombosis and fat embolism or rib infarction. Our results are therefore suggestive that the pathogenesis of ACS in our setting is also multifactorial. Further well-designed studies with large sample sizes are warranted to better elucidate the etiology of ACS in our setting.

In line with the literature, our management of ACS included broad-spectrum antibiotherapy, hydration, analgesics, supplemental oxygen and transfusion, but none of these supportive care impacted the duration of hospital stay. Actually, only patients presenting respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, mainly due to limitation of resources. Likewise, we transfused only SCD patients who had a hemoglobin level ≤ 7 g/dl given that blood safety remains an issue of major concern in the milieu. Although transfusion did not reduce the hospital stay, it significantly increased the hemoglobin level (p = 0.039), perhaps improving therefore the clinical state of our patients. Early transfusion of SCD patients presenting with ACS should be encouraged in SSA settings, especially transfusion of packed red blood cells instead of whole blood to reduce transfusion-related adverse reactions, despite recurrent blood shortages that occur in the region. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to underpin this suggestion with robust scientific evidence and indicate which threshold should be considered to transfuse SCD children suffering from ACS.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^112ZeSvp]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is particularly affected by sickle cell disease (SCD), there is dearth of research on this topic in the region, specifically targeting the magnitude of SCD-related complications. We therefore conducted this study to determine the burden of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and describe its clinical and therapeutic aspects among SCD children in Cameroon, a SSA country.

Methods

This was a retrospective study carried-out from September 2013 to June 2014 at the SCD unit of the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation, a pediatric reference centre in Yaoundé, Cameroon. We enrolled all SCD children with confirmed diagnosis of ACS, and recorded their clinical presentation at admission along with their evolution during hospitalization.

Results

Twenty one cases of ACS were identified during the study period, from 338 hospitalizations of children with SCD. Ages ranged from 11 months to 16 years with a mean (standard deviation) of 5.5 (3.4) years, and a male/female sex ratio of 3.2/1. We noticed relatively low levels of HbF, from 6.4 to 21.9% with a mean of 14.6% (6.0%). The three main symptoms at admission were fever (90.5%), cough (81%) and chest pains (28.6%). Two patients (9.5%) developed ACS 2 days after admission. The mean values of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum CRP, serum LDH and hemoglobin were respectively 32479.4 (17862.3)/mm(3), 23476 (11543.7)/mm(3), 228.2 (132.6) mg/l, 3452.3 (2916.3) IU/l and 6.5 (1.2) g/dl. The main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations were the lower lobes (90.5%). Treatment associated broad-spectrum antibiotics (100%), hydration (100%), analgesics (43.2%), whole blood transfusion (66.7%), and oxygen supplementation (33.3%). Blood transfusion significantly improved hemoglobin level (p = 0.039). The duration of hospitalization, the mean of which was 6.8 (3.1) days, was influenced by none of the tested variables (all p values > 0.05).

Conclusion

ACS is frequent among SCD children in our milieu. Its etiologies seem to be multifactorial. Patients' parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences.

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function in hemoglobinopathies result in impaired gas exchange, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia is defined as the deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body and is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies, and its cause is often multifactorial. Chronic hypoxia in hemoglobinopathies is often a sign of disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is important in order to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications. In this article, we discuss management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to review the current understanding of the disease pathophysiology, demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, explore diagnostic pathways, and review the current management.

### Symptomatic patients with P369S-R408Q mutations: familial mediterranean fever or mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome? [^112wMskf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 51-year-old South African female of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was admitted with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and fever. She experienced vague abdominal and calf pains for 30 years. Her monozygotic twin was investigated independently for recurrent abdominal pain. Despite initially responding to antibiotics, treating suspected pneumonia, she developed recurrent fevers and pleuritic chest pain. After thorough investigation without significant findings, she re-attended days after discharge with similar symptoms. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was suggested as she met diagnostic criteria and responded to colchicine, though FMF normally presents before 20 years old. Genetic testing showed no pathogenic mutations but heterozygous P369S and R408Q mutations. The significance of these mutations remains unclear, as they are found in asymptomatic patients, suggesting incomplete penetrance. She remains well, with full symptom resolution, but mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome may be a more appropriate diagnosis in symptomatic patients with both P369S and R408Q mutations.

### Pulmonary leucostasis syndrome presented by unilateral pulmonary infiltrates [^1177cvvV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old woman presented with suspected acute myelogenous leukaemia with a leucocyte count of 80×10(9)/L. On admission, she had high fever and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray demonstrated unilateral consolidations of right lung suggestive for pneumonia and broad spectrum antibiotics were started. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and despite the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary leucostasis and treatment with leucapheresis the patient died within 2days after admission from progressive respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Autopsy showed diffuse leucostasis in the pulmonary capillaries. The present case illustrates that pulmonary leucostasis may be presented by unilateral chest X-ray abnormalities and without clear neurological symptoms (headache and blurred vision). Clinicians should be aware of this since delayed treatment may increase mortality.

### "Sickle cell disease in the emergency department: atypical complications and management" [^111ekpD6]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. This disorder of hemoglobin structure leads to a chronic hemolytic anemia and complex chronic disease manifested by sudden, severe, and life-threatening complications. These acute complications can occur in any organ system beginning in early childhood and lasting throughout life. The intermittent nature and acuity of these complications lend the emergency department to be an important site of care. The hallmark of sickle cell disease is the vasoocclusive painful event. Other more "typical" complications include fever, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and ischemic stroke. Children with sickle cell disease can also present with other "atypical" complications that can have devastating consequences if they are unrecognized. Detailed discussion of these "atypical" sickle cell disease complications, organized by organ system involved, will be the focus of this article.

### Mycoplasma disease and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^111Nw4Ci]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease. Radiographic and clinical findings in ACS resemble pneumonia; however, etiologies other than infectious pathogens have been implicated, including pulmonary fat embolism (PFE) and infarction of segments of the pulmonary vasculature. The National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group was designed to identify the etiologic agents and clinical outcomes associated with this syndrome.

Methods

Data were analyzed from the prospective study of 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients with sickle cell anemia. ACS was defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate involving at least 1 complete segment of the lung, excluding atelectasis. In addition, the patients had to have chest pain, fever > 38.5C, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. Samples of blood and deep sputum were analyzed for evidence of bacteria, viruses, and PFE. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was determined by analysis of paired serologies. Detailed information on patient characteristics, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected.

Results

Fifty-one (9%) of 598 episodes of ACS had serologic evidence of M pneumoniae infection. Twelve percent of the 112 episodes of ACS occurring in patients younger than 5 years were associated with M pneumoniae infection. At the time of diagnosis, 98% of all patients with M pneumoniae infection had fever, 78% had a cough, and 51% were tachypneic. More than 50% developed multilobar infiltrates and effusions, 82% were transfused, and 6% required assisted ventilation. The average hospital stay was 10 days. Evidence of PFE with M pneumoniae infection was seen in 5 (20%) of 25 patients with adequate deep respiratory samples for the PFE assay. M pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae was found in 16% of patients with diagnostic studies for C pneumoniae. Mycoplasma hominis was cultured in 10 (2%) of 555 episodes of ACS and occurred more frequently in older patients, but the presenting symptoms and clinical course was similar to those with M pneumoniae.

Conclusions

M pneumoniae is commonly associated with the ACS in patients with sickle cell anemia and occurs in very young children. M hominis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACS. Aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including 1 from the macrolide class, is recommended for all patients as well as bronchodilator therapy, early transfusion, and respiratory support when clinically indicated.

### Respiratory phenotype and health care utilization patterns by adults with sickle cell disease [^112Papc3]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystemic disorder driven by an underlying pathophysiology of episodic vascular occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion injury, hemolysis with resultant anemia, and chronic inflammation. In SCD, a physician diagnosis of asthma is an independent risk factor for early mortality and is associated earlier onset and increased rates of acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, and painful episodes. Studies have also identified individuals with SCD who demonstrate respiratory symptoms compatible with asthma (eg, cough, wheeze, and dyspnea) who never fulfill the diagnostic criteria for asthma. Notably, studies of children and adults with SCD have demonstrated evidence of airway hyperresponsiveness at a high rate compared with the general population. Although small studies have shown an association between recurrent wheezing and increased health care utilization, it remains unknown whether episodic respiratory symptoms including cough and wheeze are associated with the same patterns of health care utilization. To evaluate the association between intermittent respiratory symptoms and health care utilization among adults with SCD, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using state-level health care utilization database. Our prespecified hypothesis was that individuals with SCD and intermittent respiratory symptoms would have higher health care utilization (overall and pain related) than individuals with SCD without a respiratory diagnosis.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, reduces life expectancy by > 20 years. SCD primarily affects persons whose ancestors came from Africa, where malaria is endemic, because the carrier state (sickle cell trait, inheritance of a sickle cell gene from only one parent) confers a selective advantage by protecting against the harmful effects of malaria. * Thus, > 90% of the estimated 100,000 persons in the United States with SCD are non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and an estimated 3%–9% are Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic). In persons with SCD, red blood cells become rigid and deform into a crescent or sickle shape. Sickled cells die early and often become lodged in small blood vessels, compromising blood flow, which can lead to serious health problems. SCD-associated complications include anemia; acute and chronic pain; infections; pneumonia and acute chest syndrome †; stroke; and kidney, liver, and heart disease. Despite their extensive health care needs, many persons with SCD have difficulty accessing appropriate care and report feeling stigmatized and having their symptoms dismissed when they do seek care.

### Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report [^115tLScc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The SCD population represents several million people worldwide, while there is no epidemiological data specific to this population regarding SARS-CoV-2. Although its pathophysiology and epidemiology differ from those of the H1N1 influenza epidemic, it should be recalled that in SCD patients, the severity of the infection was much greater than in the general population (17% rate of hospitalization in ICU, the vast majority of whom had ARDS). The SCD population is thus likely an at-risk population regarding the Covid 19.

Distinctive features of Covid 19 appear to include endothelial damage and procoagulant status. Indeed, Varga et al. have described a shift in the vascular equilibrium with endothelitis with lymphocytic infiltration and subsequent ischemia associated with a procoagulant state, particularly in high-risk ethnicity, such as African-Americans. Sickle cell patients constitutionally suffer from small vessel vasculopathy. Therefore, the SCD population seems particularly at risk of developing very severe pulmonary vascular damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Experience with ECMO in SCD patients with ARDS has been disappointing so far, with a case-fatality rate of 73%. The survival in our patient despite criteria for severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia suggest that ECMO should still be considered in such patients, and that the damages associated with COVID-19 differ from ARDS due to other causes, especially ACS in SCD patients. Fogarty et al. suggested that a specific phenotype of refractory ARDS caused by COVID-19 was associated with concurrent 'double-hit' pathologies targeting both ventilation and perfusion within the lungs through the involvement of ACE2 receptors present in type II pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells.

It is noteworthy that our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. For example, Cechini et al. recently reported that 100% such patients had PAH and 90% had ACP. Several echocardiographies have been performed throughout the evolution of our patient, showing no evidence of acute PAH. The lack of ACP in our patient may be related to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and associated marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation. Given the recorded frequency of pulmonary artery thrombosis associated with COVID-19, therapeutic anticoagulation may also have contributed to a protective effect on the occurrence of ACP in our patient.

### Which febrile children with sickle cell disease need a chest X-ray? [^112Qy569]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy exists regarding which febrile children with sickle cell disease (SCD) should receive a chest x-ray (CXR). Our goal is to provide data informing the decision of which febrile children with SCD presenting to the emergency department (ED) require a CXR to evaluate for acute chest syndrome (ACS).

Methods

Retrospective chart review of children ages 3 months to 21 years with SCD presenting to the ED at one of two academic children's hospitals with fever ≥ 38.5°C between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Demographic characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and laboratory results were abstracted. The primary outcome was the presence of ACS. Binary recursive partitioning was performed to determine predictive factors for a diagnosis of ACS.

Results

A total of 185 (10%) of 1,837 febrile ED visits met ACS criteria. The current National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) consensus criteria for obtaining a CXR (shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, or rales) identified 158 (85%) of ACS cases, while avoiding 825 CXRs. Obtaining a CXR in children with NHLBI criteria or chest pain and in children without those symptoms but with a white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 18.75 × 10 9 /L or a history of ACS identified 181 (98%), while avoiding 430 CXRs.

Conclusion

Children with SCD presenting to the ED with fever and shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, rales, or chest pain should receive a CXR due to high ACS rates. A higher WBC count or history of ACS in a child without one of those symptoms may suggest the need for a CXR. Prospective validation of these criteria is needed.

### Pulmonary platelet thrombi and vascular pathology in acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease [^116TfVJN]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to potentially reducing inflammation, by blocking platelet mediated TSP‐1 release and ADAMTS‐13 inhibition 22, 34 platelet inhibition therapy may also benefit progression to or therapy for ACS. Hemolysis, a known activator of platelets may therefore be a multi‐hit on ADAMTS‐13 via indirect activation of platelets and release of TSP‐1 and/or direct inhibition of the enzyme. Either way, multiple lines of evidence are converging. In fact, the acute clinical event most closely associated with inhibition of ADAMTS‐13 in SCD is a strong history of ACS 34. Thus, investigation into the platelet/hemolysis/vWF interaction in ACS clearly merits further study. The key mediator of progression to or severity of ACS may be the platelet. In instances of death unrelated to ACS, our data suggest little role for platelet occlusion or vWF.

Consistent with a role for vWF in platelet thrombi during ACS, it is notable that in the presence of platelet rich thrombi, we describe increased vWF deposition and aggregated vWF in the lungs suggesting a common etiology underlying platelet occlusion. However, this study cannot establish the definitive link between ACS and vWf composition in these patients, but can provide the basis for additional study. Further prospective inquiry in ACS should prove beneficial in verifying or refuting the role of ADAMTS‐13, hemolysis, and vWF in ACS. Determining the activity of ADAMTS‐13 during ACS, though out of reach of this study, is an essential step in validating our results.

However, even though the cultures for all patients with platelet thrombi were negative for bacteria, gram negative infection — such as Streptococcus pneumonia — could potentiate platelet activation via the TLR‐4 receptor on the surface of the platelet 11. Such infection could promote the adhesion of platelets to any site at which an adhesive substrate is exposed in the vasculature. In this mechanism we see a confluence of vWF deposition, coupled with infection that could create a significant and negative impact on lung function.

### Sickle cell disease: a review [^11393FXp]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, characterized by formation of long chains of hemoglobin when deoxygenated within capillary beds, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells, progressive multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. An estimated 300 000 infants are born annually worldwide with SCD. Most individuals with SCD live in sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and Middle East; approximately 100 000 individuals with SCD live in the US.

Observations

SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy for most individuals with SCD. Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab reduced pain crises from 2.98 to 1.63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo (51% vs 7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general population.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, approximately 100 000 people have SCD, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor is now standard care for severe disease.

Recommendation 3 — recurrent acute chest syndrome (ACS) in SCD: For patients with recurrent episodes of ACS, the ASH guideline panel suggests using matched related allogeneic transplantation over the standard of care (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remark: Consideration for transplantation should be given to patients who continue to have recurrent ACS despite optimal standard of care (eg, HU, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and chronic transfusion therapy). Background notes that Patients with SCD may experience recurrent episodes of ACS, which can be life threatening or fatal; current standard treatment of ACS prevention may include HU, CRCT, and oral l-glutamine, and HSCT has been performed in patients with ACS events to prevent recurrent episodes; the panel systematically reviewed existing data to compare HSCT with HU and CRCT to prevent recurrent ACS events.

### Obstructive bronchial fibrin cast formation in COVID-19 severe respiratory failure [^117KcZjx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old female with a medical history significant only for obesity presented with approximately 1 week of viral symptoms and acute-onset shortness of breath. Diagnostic work-up revealed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with associated severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. Because of progressing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, she was admitted directly to the ICU for mechanical ventilation and standard COVID-19 treatments available at the time (remdesivir, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, anakinra, and prophylactic enoxaparin). Admission chest computed tomography showed scattered foci of airway filling within areas of airspace disease in a patchy distribution (Figures 1A–1C). Despite 2 weeks of escalating support, the patient developed refractory hemodynamic instability resulting in cardiorespiratory failure and death. Examination of the lungs at autopsy showed evidence of numerous acute and focally organizing thrombi in the pulmonary artery distribution, as well as bronchial/bronchiolar casts (Figure 1D). The casts were present in a heterogenous distribution throughout small- and medium-sized airways. Histopathologic evaluation revealed the casts to be composed of fibrin and scattered inflammatory cells (Figures 1E and 1F). Lumen obstruction by casts was partial and incomplete. Obstructive fibrin airway cast formation, or plastic bronchitis, has been described in patients after Fontan procedure, sickle cell disease, influenza infection, severe asthma, and smoke and chemical inhalation injuries. The patient did not have any of these classically described risk factors. The exact contribution of the airway casts to the patient's demise is difficult to discern, but their contribution to the patient's overall hypoxia is likely important. This is the first report of airway fibrin cast obstruction in a patient with fatal severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Bronchial circulation dysfunction found in COVID-19 infection may play a role in bronchial cast formation because of SARS-CoV-2.

### Pulmonary platelet thrombi and vascular pathology in acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease [^113MHrFM]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In summary, we detected a platelet mediated occlusion in 3 out of 10 patients with SCD who succumbed to ACS. These occlusions were associated with younger age, higher platelet counts in ACS coupled with a significant drop in platelet count as ACS worsened. We also noted an increase in quantity and nature of endothelial vWF deposition. Although it is one of the most common insults to the lungs in SCD, we found no relationship between a significant history and severity of ACS and pulmonary artery remodeling. We noted that the degree of pulmonary artery remodeling appears to decline with age. Taken together these data suggest a novel etiology of ACS that involves profound pulmonary platelet thrombi, but may preclude ACS as a significant contributor to pulmonary insult in SCD.

Although clearly, due to the limited size of the study, the data and any conclusions must be interpreted with a degree of caution. However, an autopsy case study of 10 patients who died with ACS, and 20 in total is, to our knowledge, one of the bigger studies of its kind. As such, this work has produced some novel, potentially relevant findings. Our data suggest that, since most of the patients in the ACS group presented with pain as their initial symptom, the evolution of a pain crisis into ACS may, in some cases, be related to platelet and platelet activation. Platelet activation and platelet mediated inflammation increases during pain crisis, making them attractive therapeutic targets 29. There have been several studies of anti‐platelet agents in steady state SCD, mainly ADP‐receptor antagonists 30, 31. The use of such agents are well tolerated and may mitigate pain. One agent, eptifibatide, has been administered during both steady state 32 and acute pain crisis 33 and appears to be well tolerated in both settings. In fact, eptifibatide may reduce platelet mediated inflammation at steady state 32, as does prasaquel 30. There may, however, be some concern about administering an anti‐platelet agent to a patient with ACS and declining platelet counts. However, platelet inhibition at steady state, or in the hemodynamically stable acute crisis, might be an important therapeutic addition to prevent progression to ACS.

### Golden tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar fluid during acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^116aMDv4]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of ICU admission in patients with sickle cell disease and is characterized by golden sputum, which is commonly attributed to the presence of bilirubin. Three young consecutive patients with homozygous sickle cell disease were admitted for severe acute respiratory syndrome due to ACS. In all 3 patients, tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed a yellowish plasma-like stain. After normalization for the plasma-to-BAL urea ratio, BALF protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were consistent with an exudative process. BALF bilirubin concentrations were very low, implying that the yellowish stain was not related to bilirubin content. The yellowish coloration of tracheal secretions and BALF observed during ACS appears to be related to an intense exudative process rather than to the presence of bilirubin.

### The molecular basis for the prothrombotic state in sickle cell disease [^1162QzV2]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical and genetic risk factors for the prothrombotic state

Clinical and biological factors provide insight into why a genetic disorder primarily involving red cells sets off a cascade of events leading to an acquired prothrombotic state. Risk factors for VTE in SCD include increased disease severity (as measured by averaging ≥ 3 hospital admissions a year for VOC), exposure to erythropoiesis stimulating agents or blood transfusion, insertion of central venous catheters (CVC), surgical splenectomy, and hospitalization. As mentioned above, not only are SCD patients at a high risk for developing early onset VTE, but their risk for VTE recurrence after an index VTE has been noted to be high. Clinical risk factors for VTE recurrence include averaging > 3 hospital admissions a year, lower extremity DVT as the index event, and a prior history of pneumonia/acute chest syndrome (ACS). Incomplete adherence to anticoagulation is also likely to contribute to higher recurrence rates, though this has not been formally evaluated. In a single center retrospective study, use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) was associated with lower recurrence rate.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for sickle cell disease: stem cell transplantation [^117Aw82h]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) guidelines state that HSCT is currently the only curative intervention for SCD and are intended to support patients, clinicians, and researchers who consider or perform HSCT for SCD. The guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with Evidence-to-Decision frameworks. The panel agreed on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. The evidence review yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest syndrome at an early age, and the panel addressed HSCT use for patients with SCD with neurologic injury, frequent pain, or acute chest syndrome as well as issues related to the type of transplantation and donor used and age of the patient.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Hemorheological risk factors of acute chest syndrome and painful vaso-occlusive crisis in children with sickle cell disease [^1155yKKR]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the effects of blood rheology on the occurrence of acute chest syndrome and painful vaso-occlusive crises in children with sickle cell anemia and hemoglobin SC disease.

Design and Methods

To address this issue, steady-state hemorheological profiles (blood viscosity, red blood cell deformability, aggregation properties) and hematologic parameters were assessed in 44 children with sickle cell anemia and 49 children with hemoglobin SC disease (8–16 years old) followed since birth. Clinical charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine prior acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive episodes, and rates of these complications were calculated.

Results

Multivariate analysis revealed that: 1) a higher steady-state blood viscosity was associated with a higher rate of vaso-occlusive crises in children with sickle cell anemia, but not in children with hemoglobin SC disease; 2) a higher steady-state red blood cell disaggregation threshold was associated with previous history of acute chest syndrome in children with hemoglobin SC disease and boys with sickle cell anemia.

Conclusions

Our results indicate for the first time that the red blood cell aggregation properties may play a role in the pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome in children with hemoglobin SC disease and boys with sickle cell anemia. In addition, whereas greater blood viscosity is associated with a higher rate of vaso-occlusive crises in children with sickle cell anemia, no association was found in children with hemoglobin SC disease, underscoring differences in the etiology of vaso-occlusive crises between sickle cell anemia and hemoglobin SC disease.

### Individuals with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait demonstrate no increase in mortality or critical illness from COVID-19-a fifteen hospital observational study in the bronx, New York [^113pf67M]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

With a median age of 30 years, our SCD cohort was relatively young consistent with other reports. Despite being of young age, SCD patients had more comorbidities than the older general population, consistent with SCD-related complicationsand end organ damage. SCD patients had lower hemoglobin and hematocrit, and higher monocyte count, reticulocytes, leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin compared to the general population and SCT (Online Supplementary Table S1), consistent with red blood cell dysfunction and hepatobiliary manifestations of SCD. SCD patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer (Online Supplementary Table S1), which could be suggestive of more severe COVID-19 diseasebut other explanations are possible. Elevated LDH, however could result from intravascular hemolysis, ischemia-reperfusion damage and tissue necrosis associated with SCD but could be further elevated in acute VOC. More studies are needed to further evaluate the consequences of immunological dysregulation associated with COVID-19 in SCD and SCT patients.

Hospital visits were likely associated with SCD-related pain or acute chest syndrome (ACS) triggered by the COVID-19 diseaseas 67% of admitted SCD patients had one or more SCD-related symptoms at admission, including ACS (n = 11), pain crisis (n = 11), anemia (n = 5), and splenic infarct (n = 1). Crisis manifestations of SCD might have contributed to favorable outcomes due to proactive seeking of medical care for SCD-related symptoms.

In order to limit the potential confounding effects of group differences in demographic variables and preexisting conditions on COVID-19 outcomes, we conducted additional comparisons with age-, sex-, race-, ethnicityand comorbidity-matched controls (Table 2). We found neither significant differences (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon ranksum tests) in COVID-19 related outcomes between SCD patients and matched controls, nor between SCT patient and their matched controls. Our findings suggest that individuals with SCD or SCT in this cohort did not carry an added risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to individuals with similar demographics and health status without SCD or SCT. However, SCD patients could have other severe outcomes not evaluated here (e.g. pain or pneumonia).

### Fetal hemoglobin rescues ineffective erythropoiesis in sickle cell disease [^115kmyNQ]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal hereditary recessive disorder caused by a point mutation in the b -globin gene resulting in a Glu-to-Val substitution at the sixth position of the b-globin protein. The resulting abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes under hypoxic conditions driving red blood cell (RBC) sickling.SCD is a multisystem disease characterized by hemolytic anemia, high susceptibility to infections, recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises, strokes, acute chest syndrome and organ failure.

While the pathobiology of circulating RBC has been extensively analyzed in SCD, erythropoiesis is surprisingly poorly documented. In b-thalassemia, ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by high levels of apoptotic erythroblasts during the late stages of terminal differentiation, due to an accumulation of free α- globin chains. Ineffective erythropoiesis is the major cause of anemia in b-thalassemia patients. In contrast, a marked decrease in the life span of circulating red cells, a feature of sickle red cells, is considered to be the major determinant of chronic anemia in SCD. It is generally surmised that ineffective erythropoiesis contributes little to anemia. There have been, however, a number of sporadic reports that suggest defective terminal erythroid differentiation in SCD. For example, erythroblasts differentiated in vitro or isolated from bone marrow of SCD patients were shown to sickle under hypoxic conditions. Such sickling was also reported in the SAD mouse model, with altered morphology of late stage erythroid precursors within the bone marrow, as well as high levels of hemoglobin polymers and increased cell fragmentation occurring during medullary endothelial migration of reticulocytes. It was presumed that sickling of erythroblasts could lead to ineffective terminal erythroid differentiation. The study of Wu et al. showed for the first time evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis occurring in the bone marrow of transplanted SCD patients with the preferential survival of the donor erythroid cells in a small cohort of patients.

In the present study, we performed a detailed characterization of terminal erythroid differentiation in non-transplanted SCD patients using both in vivo and in vitro assay systems to critically assess the extent of ineffective erythropoiesis. We documented in both our in vivo and in vitro studies, the occurrence of ineffective erythropoiesis at late stages of terminal erythroid differentiation reflected by high cell death rates between the polychromatic and the orthochromatic stages. We explored the potential mechanistic basis for ineffective erythropoiesis in SCD patients and showed that the molecular mechanism responsible for cell death is likely related to HbS polymerization and its interaction with chaperone protein HSP70 leading to its cytoplasmic sequestration. Importantly, we documented that increased expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can rescue differentiating erythroblasts from cell death.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic and chronic disease that primarily affects Black and Hispanic populations in the United States. It causes significant morbidity, including acute and chronic pain, decreased quality of life, end-organ damage, and reduces the average lifespan by 20 to 30 years compared with those without SCD. There are several well-documented factors that contribute to the morbidity and mortality in people with SCD (pwSCD), and acute and chronic pulmonary conditions are the most common ones. For example, asthma is seen in ∼12% of all children in the United States, but it is estimated that 20% to 25% of children with SCD have concomitant asthma. However, clear definitions of asthma in SCD versus wheezing from other chronic mechanisms, such as hemolysis-induced inflammation, are not well identifiedand typically require pulmonary subspecialty evaluation and management. People with asthma and SCD have an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with those without asthma. This is likely because of their increased risk of developing acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOEs), stroke, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and the increased need for blood transfusions compared with those with SCD alone.

ACS itself is also a significant contributor to SCD morbidity and mortality. ACS is the second most common cause of hospitalization and the most common cause of death, with 25% of pwSCD succumbing to this complication. Recurrent ACS episodes lead to an increased risk of irreversible lung damage that can manifest as either a restrictive or an obstructive chronic lung disease pattern. In addition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is another common pulmonary condition that can complicate SCD. Whereas 1% to 5% of children are diagnosed with OSA, the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders remains poorly defined, with past studies documenting that OSA affects between 5% and 59% of pwSCD. Sleep disorders are particularly problematic in pwSCD as airway obstruction during sleep leads to oxygen desaturations that can increase erythrocyte sickling and subsequent pathology, including cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.

### Flow adhesion of whole blood to P-selectin: a prognostic biomarker for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease [^114gnGjy]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hereditary blood disorders affecting over 100,000 people in the United States and many more world‐wide. The most common genotype is homozygous haemoglobin SS (HbSS). SCD is associated with a wide range of symptoms and adverse events including chronic anaemia, pulmonary hypertension and acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic and renal dysfunction, and susceptibility to bacterial infections. Many of these symptoms are related to vaso‐occlusion crises (VOC), a common painful complication of SCD responsible for about 85% of all SCD‐related emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations. Diagnosis may be complicated by the lack of objective metrics of pain severity, resulting in providers relying on subjective reports from SCD patients. Traditionally, treatment options have been limited, focusing primarily on alleviating symptoms with analgesics, with simple or exchange blood transfusions used in severe cases. Preventively, severe SCD is often managed with hydroxycarbamide (HC) which promotes fetal haemoglobin (HbF) formation and was shown to reduce the frequency and shorten the duration of hospitalization due to VOC. While the precise pathways leading to VOC remain uncertain, and possibly vary between subjects, the formation of cellular aggregates, which interact with the endothelium to cause microvascular occlusion and local ischaemia, are believed to be major contributors to the microvascular blood flow disturbances that characterize VOCs.

### Complications of sickle cell disease… [^113LXhaY]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Chest Syndrome Acute chest syndrome is a life-threatening complication in people living with SCD that can result in lung injury, breathing difficulty, and low oxygen to the rest of the body. ACS may occur when sickled cells block blood and oxygen from reaching the lungs or may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. In children, ACS is usually caused by an infection. ACS is a medical emergency and should be treated in the hospital right away. Signs and symptoms are similar to pneumonia and can include:

- Chest pain
- Coughing
- Difficulty breathing
- Fever Other Resources. Anemia With SCD, the red blood cells die early, leading to a condition called anemia. Anemia occurs when there is not enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. When a person has anemia, they might feel tired.

Other symptoms can include:

- Irritability
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- A fast heart rate
- Difficulty breathing
- Pale skin color
- Jaundice
- Slow growth
- Delayed puberty Other Resources. A PE can occur without any symptoms of a DVT. Signs and symptoms of PE can include:

- Difficulty breathing
- Faster than normal or irregular heartbeat
- Chest pain or discomfort that worsens with a deep breath or cough
- Cough or coughing up blood
- Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical help immediately. CDC Resources to Learn More Other Resources.
- Acute sickle hepatic crisis is when sickled cells in the blood vessels cause a pain crisis occurring in the liver.
- Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs when sickled cells block blood flow in the liver. The blockage prevents oxygen from reaching the liver, damaging the liver.

Pulmonary Hypertension People with SCD are at greater risk than the general population for high blood pressure in the lungs, which can be life-threatening. Some signs and symptoms of high blood pressure in the lungs can include:

- Difficulty breathing
- Fatigue
- Chest discomfort or pain
- Swelling of the ankles, legs, or abdomen
- Light-headedness or dizziness CDC Resources to Learn More Other Resources.
