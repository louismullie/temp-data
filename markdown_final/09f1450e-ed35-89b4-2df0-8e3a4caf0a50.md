## Question

Pseudomonas pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Pseudomonas pneumonia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the pneumonia syndrome and identifying risk factors for Pseudomonas. Then, I should verify empiric therapy choices and when to use combination versus monotherapy. Next, I will review definitive therapy once susceptibilities return, including duration and de-escalation. After that, I need to consider special populations and difficult-to-treat resistance. Finally, I will integrate diagnostics, stewardship, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because empiric therapy hinges on whether this is community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia, and whether the patient is in septic shock or at high risk of death, as this drives combination decisions and urgency of therapy [^cd7a0556] [^62743750].

> I need to check Pseudomonas risk factors next, since they determine the breadth of empiric coverage. Prior respiratory isolation of Pseudomonas, recent hospitalization or parenteral antibiotics within 90 days, structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis, and mechanical ventilation all increase risk, and in CAP these risks should trigger empiric antipseudomonal therapy with cultures obtained before antibiotics when feasible [^cd7a0556] [^74c41942] [^88dd7966].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy. I should verify the strength of recommendations. For HAP/VAP, guidelines strongly recommend empiric coverage of Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives, and suggest two agents from different classes when risk factors for Pseudomonas are present or mortality risk is high, while recommending against aminoglycoside monotherapy; for CAP, add antipseudomonal coverage only when validated risk factors are present and obtain cultures to enable de-escalation [^81ce08b9] [^47ffae50] [^cd7a0556] [^74c41942].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for combination therapy in high-risk HAP/VAP. The benefit is largely in reducing the chance of inappropriate initial therapy, which is associated with higher mortality; once susceptibilities are known, definitive monotherapy is generally sufficient unless the patient remains in septic shock or at high risk of death, in which case combination therapy is reasonable though evidence quality is low [^1113ac34] [^62743750] [^598d5b5c].

> I will now examine empiric regimen choices. Reasonable options include an antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem, paired with a second agent from a different class such as a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside when risk factors are present; avoid aminoglycoside monotherapy due to poor lung penetration and lack of supportive data, and tailor choices to local antibiograms and patient-specific factors [^81ce08b9] [^0b276e27] [^e589bb5c].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. If the patient is not in septic shock and not at high risk of death, monotherapy with an active agent is recommended; if shock or high mortality risk persists, combination therapy with two active agents is suggested, albeit with weak recommendation and very low-quality evidence, so I need to ensure we de-escalate promptly when clinically safe [^62743750] [^598d5b5c].

> Let me consider duration and step-down carefully. For HAP/VAP due to Pseudomonas, 7 days is generally sufficient if the patient is clinically improving, with shorter courses acceptable in selected contexts; for CAP with Pseudomonas, extend to 7 days total, and switch to oral therapy when stable and able to absorb, using the same class when possible to maintain activity [^760f62a6] [^18a4abf5].

> But wait, what if this is a special population. In cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis, I should confirm that both empiric and definitive therapy often warrant two antipseudomonal agents given chronic colonization and biofilm biology; in immunocompromised hosts, broaden early and consider invasive diagnostics; in severe sepsis or ARDS, ensure adequate source control and consider adjunctive measures per institutional protocols [^81ce08b9] [^754925f7].

> I need to ensure we address difficult-to-treat resistance. For DTR Pseudomonas, newer agents such as ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-relebactam, or cefiderocol may be indicated based on susceptibilities; cefiderocol is preferred when metallo-beta-lactamases are present, and inhaled antibiotics are not routinely recommended for DTR pneumonia given lack of consistent benefit in trials, though selective use may be considered in refractory cases with careful monitoring [^29653b5a] [^9a996572].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic steps that enable de-escalation. In CAP with suspected Pseudomonas, obtain sputum and blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible; in HAP/VAP, use quantitative cultures from endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage to guide narrowing; reassess at 48–72 hours and de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response to minimize resistance and toxicity [^74c41942] [^c4edabfe] [^88dd7966].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure internal consistency. Classify syndrome and assess severity and Pseudomonas risk; if risk is present, start empiric antipseudomonal therapy with one or two agents based on HAP/VAP versus CAP and mortality risk; obtain cultures; narrow to definitive monotherapy when stable and susceptibilities allow; treat for 7 days in most cases; and apply special-population modifications as indicated, aligning each step with guideline strength and local epidemiology [^62743750] [^cd7a0556] [^760f62a6].

---

Pseudomonas pneumonia is best managed with **early, appropriate empiric therapy** [^ee82e57c] and rapid de-escalation to active monotherapy once susceptibilities are known [^62743750]. For HAP/VAP, use **two antipseudomonal agents** when risk factors or high mortality risk are present [^47ffae50]; for CAP, add antipseudomonal coverage only with validated risk factors [^cd7a0556]. Avoid aminoglycoside monotherapy [^361fcf07] and tailor therapy to local resistance patterns [^e589bb5c]; treat for 7 days if the patient is clinically improving [^760f62a6]. In difficult-to-treat resistance, consider cefiderocol, ceftolozane-tazobactam, or ceftazidime-avibactam [^29653b5a]; adjunctive inhaled therapy is not routinely recommended [^9a996572].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Pseudomonas pneumonia typically presents with **fever, cough, dyspnea, and purulent sputum** [^notfound]; severe cases may progress rapidly to respiratory failure and septic shock [^410c7277]. Risk factors include:

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Strong risk for VAP [^notfound].
- **Structural lung disease**: Bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis [^81ce08b9].
- **Immunosuppression**: Neutropenia, HIV, malignancy [^205b2a7a].
- **Recent healthcare exposure**: Hospitalization, nursing home residence, dialysis [^95eb2b4a].
- **Prior antibiotic exposure**: Especially broad-spectrum agents [^ae596b86].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment plus microbiologic confirmation**:

- **Clinical criteria**: New infiltrate on chest imaging with compatible symptoms and signs [^d1ddd5a8].
- **Microbiologic testing**: Sputum cultures, blood cultures, and, in ventilated patients, quantitative cultures from endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [^c4edabfe].
- **Rapid diagnostics**: PCR and mass spectrometry can expedite identification and susceptibility testing [^notfound].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be **initiated promptly** [^ee82e57c] and tailored to risk factors and local resistance patterns:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| HAP/VAP with risk factors for Pseudomonas | Two antipseudomonal agents from different classes (e.g. β-lactam + fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside) [^47ffae50] [^81ce08b9] |
| HAP/VAP without risk factors | Single antipseudomonal agent (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem) [^47ffae50] [^345881cc] |
| CAP with risk factors for Pseudomonas | β-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem) + fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside [^3d1c7e5d] |

---

Avoid **aminoglycoside monotherapy** due to poor lung penetration and limited efficacy [^361fcf07] [^0b276e27].

---

## Definitive therapy based on susceptibility results

Once susceptibilities are available, **de-escalate to a single active agent** [^62743750]; combination therapy is reserved for patients with septic shock or high mortality risk [^9ea65396]. Recommended agents include:

- **Β-lactams**: Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, aztreonam.
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin.
- **Aminoglycosides**: Gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin (use only in combination) [^361fcf07].
- **Polymyxins**: Colistin, polymyxin B (reserved for multidrug-resistant cases) [^0b276e27].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **standard duration** is 7 days for most patients, provided they are clinically improving [^760f62a6]. Longer courses (10–14 days) may be needed for slow clinical response, immunocompromised hosts, or multidrug-resistant organisms [^notfound].

---

## Management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas

MDR Pseudomonas requires **alternative agents and strategies**:

- **Cefiderocol**: Preferred for metallo-β-lactamase producers [^29653b5a].
- **Ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam**: Options for difficult-to-treat resistance [^29653b5a].
- **Combination therapy**: Consider in severe infections or when no single agent is active [^29653b5a].
- **Adjunctive inhaled therapy**: Consider in VAP with limited intravenous options, though evidence is mixed [^7e9d52bc] [^9a996572].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Pseudomonas pneumonia is associated with **high mortality**, particularly in VAP and immunocompromised patients [^notfound]. Early appropriate therapy significantly improves outcomes, whereas delays or inappropriate therapy increase mortality [^1113ac34] [^2d58c5d0].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **infection control and risk reduction**:

- **Hand hygiene and infection control**: Strict adherence in healthcare settings [^602a9af1].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Judicious use to limit resistance [^9166fd53].
- **Vaccination**: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines reduce pneumonia risk [^8c270847].
- **Water management**: Control of hospital water systems to prevent environmental transmission [^602a9af1].

---

Pseudomonas pneumonia requires **early, appropriate empiric therapy** with rapid de-escalation, attention to risk factors, and local resistance patterns. Outcomes hinge on timely intervention and adherence to guideline-directed care, with newer agents expanding options for MDR cases [^62743750] [^29653b5a].

In view of the mortality associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the frequency of inadequate initial empiric therapy, recent findings underscore the need for a different management paradigm with effective anti-pseudomonal vaccines for prophylaxis of patients at risk. The association of virulence factors is a variable that splits PSA in two phenotypes, with the possibility of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for management of virulent strains. We comment on recent advances in and the state of the art of PSA-VAP management and discuss a new paradigm for tailored and optimal management.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — antibiotic strategy guidance: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk > 25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk < 15%. For a patient whose septic shock resolves when antimicrobial sensitivities were known, continued combination therapy is not recommended.

### Clinical approach to the patient with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia [^c4edabfe]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia needs to balance the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic overuse with the provision of adequate initial empiric therapy. A clinical diagnosis based on new pulmonary opacity and purulent respiratory secretions plus other signs of inflammation is valuable in screening for patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. A rational strategy starts with immediate initiation of adequate antibiotics and collection of respiratory secretions to evaluate the causative organism. As a minimum, an endotracheal aspirate with direct staining and quantitative cultures should be obtained. Overall, the need to choose adequate antibiotics correctly and expeditiously calls for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the choice should be narrowed quickly in the light of microbiologic information. However, some patients (those who develop an infection within 5 days of hospitalization, those without recent antibiotic exposure, and those without hospitalization in the past 3 months) are at low risk of infection by resistant organisms. In that subset, adequate initial selection could be a non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, since antibiotics should target usual community-acquired organisms in addition to some Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be limited only to intensive care units with concomitant index cases and to patients under antibiotic exposure. Patients at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g., 1 week of prior hospitalization or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) require initial use of a combination of piperacilin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, or amikacin plus imipenem, meropenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin. If risk of Acinetobacter baumannii exists, one of these agents should be a carbapenem. After 48 hours of therapy, each patient should be re-evaluated based mainly on resolution of hypoxemia and fever plus the initial microbiologic information. Whereas broad-spectrum therapy is initially warranted in many patients, this treatment may be narrowed considerably as culture results identify the causative organism and its sensitivity. Recent data suggest that reducing overall treatment duration to a maximum of 1 week is safe, effective and is less likely to promote the growth of resistant organisms in patients who are clinically improving. Optimal management should be based on a strategy combining early high doses of an effective agent for a short period of time, which is then simplified in the light of microbiologic information.

### Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia: aetiology and management [^cc55bc22]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent articles of clinical and investigational interest on Gram-negative pneumonia, particularly hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, are reviewed.

Recent Findings

The high rate of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia has been repeatedly documented. The predominant pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the other hand, the frequency of Gram-negative bacteria in community-acquired pneumonia and in early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia is increasing. Patients with risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens should initially receive a combination therapy that covers a broad spectrum, and, as soon as the pathogen and the susceptibilities are available, treatment should be simplified to a more targeted one (with the possible exception of P. aeruginosa pneumonia). Adequate dosing is of great importance and the use of pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles when prescribing antibiotics increases effectiveness. The optimal duration of therapy remains unknown; several studies have supported the use of shorter courses of treatment. Alternative treatment approaches (e.g. vaccines) are under investigation.

Summary

The increasing frequency of resistant Gram-negative bacteria and the shortage of newer antibiotics in the pipeline with activity against Gram-negative bacteria is of concern. Early effective antimicrobial treatment is a key for the resolution of infection and improved survival.

### How do I manage difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections? Key questions for today's clinicians [^29653b5a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials in vivo, often leaving very limited therapeutic options and making treatment particularly challenging. In fact, P. aeruginosa infections with "difficult-to-treat resistance" are one of the most concerning contemporary bacterial infections. Many are hospital-acquired and frequently affect immunocompromised patients with high mortality risk.

Objectives

In the absence of head-to-head clinical trials, we have conducted a narrative review of the current therapeutic options for these infections addressing five key management questions.

Content and Implications

Ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam and cefiderocol are newer options, but resistance and lack of relevant data from randomised clinical trials hampers knowledge of the best way to use them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are initially preferred when susceptible because they enter the market first and there is more published evidence about them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is preferred in P. aeruginosa pneumonia instead of ceftazidime-avibactam. Both can be equally used in other P. aeruginosa infection types. Imipenem-relebactam and cefiderocol may retain susceptibility when there is resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, and when metallo-beta-lactamases are not present. However, there are no head-to-head comparative studies to support a preference for one over the other. In the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases, cefiderocol is the preferred agent. Other options in this situation are aztreonam-avibactam, ceftazidime-avibactam combined with aztreonam, and polymyxins combined with meropenem, but evidence is small. In difficult-to-treat P. aeruginosa infections combination therapy could be an option. However, despite demonstrations of in vitro synergy and of enhanced activity in hollow fiber or animal models, there is no clinical evidence to support using combination therapy in these infections and it is not currently recommended as a general option. The role of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, polymyxin B or colistin, is also reviewed.

Combination versus monotherapy for empiric gram-negative VAP coverage — across randomized studies of one vs 2 antipseudomonal agents, 7 eligible trials were identified and there were no differences in mortality, clinical response, adverse effects, or acquired resistance between monotherapy and combination arms; many studies allowed adjunctive empiric Pseudomonas coverage until pathogens were identified, limiting applicability to unselected suspected VAP.

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia, and how should it be treated? [^f072561a]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In contrast to patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia or mechanically ventilated patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia is a relatively new clinical entity that includes a spectrum of adult patients who have close association with acute care hospitals or reside in chronic care settings that increase their risk for pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species. New guidelines for the management and prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were published in 2005 and are highlighted in this article.

Recent Findings

Recent data indicate that types of multi-drug-resistant pathogens may vary in different healthcare settings, and that individuals infected with multi-drug-resistant pathogens are more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, which may result in poorer outcomes in terms of patient morbidity, mortality and increased length of hospital stay.

Summary

This review highlights key points in the new recommendations and principles for initiating, de-escalating and stopping antibiotic therapy in individuals with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Widespread implementation of these guidelines is needed in healthcare institutions in order to reduce patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^ed92d042]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to definitive antibiotic therapy (P. aeruginosa), ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering monotherapy with an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible in patients with HAP due to P. aeruginosa without septic shock or high risk of mortality.

---

### Advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking [^a83b0d6f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. Microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiological findings. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, (2) is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^ee997461]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^9ea65396]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to definitive antibiotic therapy (P. aeruginosa), ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering a combination therapy with two antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible in patients with HAP due to P. aeruginosa with septic shock or at high risk of mortality.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^914fdc8b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli epidemiology and treatment adequacy show that a meta-analysis of 23 studies found P. aeruginosa was associated with 13% of cases of HAP and other gram-negative bacilli with 22% of cases; an observational study of 165 patients suggested inadequate initial treatment may be associated with increased mortality, but this was indirect evidence because the causative pathogen was identified in only one-third of cases and, when identified, < 50% were due to P. aeruginosa or other gram-negative bacilli.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^e589bb5c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric antibiotic coverage — scope and thresholds: When local resistance resembles surveillance benchmarks, "empiric coverage should include an agent active against MRSA and at least 2 agents active against gram-negative organisms, including P. aeruginosa", whereas if local data indicate "a low prevalence of MRSA and low antibiotic resistance rates among gram-negatives", "a single agent active against MSSA combined with one agent active against Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives is likely adequate". Empiric choices "should be informed by patient-specific risk factors" and "Not all patients require maximal empiric coverage", and "Narrower-spectrum coverage may be appropriate" when risk factors and local prevalence are low. For threshold guidance, "The panel suggests that ICU-level S. aureus methicillin resistance rates of > 10%–20% merit selecting a gram-positive agent active against MRSA, and that ICU-level gram-negative resistance rates of > 10% to an agent being considered for empiric gram-negative monotherapy merit using 2 gram-negative agents for empiric therapy of suspected VAP". If calculating local rates is difficult, "the resistance rate for Pseudomonas is a reasonable, albeit conservative, proxy because Pseudomonas is the most common gram-negative organism associated with VAP".

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — monotherapy vs combination therapy: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk ≥ 25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk ≤ 15%.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^3d1c7e5d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia due to Gram-Negative bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa… [^231827d9]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

In a subgroup analysis of P aeruginosa pneumonia, pulmonary comorbidity and previous hospital admission were predictive. Infection with GNB was independently associated with death. H2 blocker for at least 30 days before hospital admission; severe sepsis or septic shock; systemic inflammatory response to infection of 559. Patients with GNB had a significantly higher mortality when compared with the non-GNB group. Table 4 summarizes univariate and multivariate associations with outcome. Of 18 patients with GNB who had received ambulatory antimicrobial treatment, 15 had an inadequate regimen.

Initial empirical in-hospital antimicrobial treatment was rated inadequate in 35 of the 60 patients with GNB. Mortality included 7 of 25 patients receiving adequate and 12 of 35 receiving inadequate initial empirical in-hospital antimicrobial treatment. The initial antimicrobial treatment was adequate in 11 of the 39 cases. Data of 544 patients were entered in the multivariate analysis, and a pulmonary comorbidity was the strongest predictor of P aeruginosa pneumonia together with a previous hospital admission. Inadequate initial empirical in-hospital antimicrobial treatment was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward a higher mortality compared with adequate treatment vs 1/8; P = 0. 27).

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^95eb2b4a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Management: patient stratification and antibiotic choices

Perhaps the greatest challenge imposed by MDR Gram-negative bacteria is attainment of the appropriate degree of balance between efficacy and ecology. It is well recognized that there are significant increases in mortality rates when antibiotic therapy is delayed, challenging the clinician to prescribe therapy broad enough to cover all of the most likely pathogens. What is simultaneously recognized is the collateral damage of selecting resistant bacteria that can occur with prolonged receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Three important categories can influence antimicrobial choices: patient characteristics; risk factors for infection with specific pathogens; and severity of illness. Of the demographic data of patients with infections, advanced age and comorbid illnesses have been associated with decreased reserve and, hence, an increase in mortality. Contact with the health care system is an important patient characteristic that influences the broadness of initial antibiotic therapy. Previous hospitalization (within the past 30 days as a defining feature of hospital-acquired infection and within the past 90 days as a defining feature of healthcare-associated infection) increases the risk of infection by a resistant pathogen that was acquired in the healthcare environment. Invasive procedures, even those occurring in the outpatient setting, increase the risk of colonization by MDR organisms, with such colonization serving as an antecedent predisposition to infection with MDR microorganisms. Local microbiologic data are extremely important in predicting the type of resistance that may be present in the etiologic agent causing a clinical infection. It is important to recognize that such local data may vary from unit to unit within a hospital, and when possible unit-specific data are optimal. In recognition of the fact that resistance can rapidly develop within a practice environment, it is important that microbiologic data should be as current as possible. Antibiograms reporting data that are from a previous year may be many months behind what is presently occurring. Very important is the role of prior antibiotic exposure, recognizing the risk of eliminating normal flora and allowing the selection of resistant bacteria. Although various timelines have been suggested in the medical literature about what defines "recent" antibiotic therapy, within the previous 90 days is a consistently cited number. A second element of importance in stratification regarding antibiotic therapy is the likely type of microorganism. As noted previously, risk stratification related to P. aeruginosa has been included in multiple clinical guidelines. Of all the variables that influence stratification of patients into a category requiring coverage of MDR bacteria, severity of illness may be the most important. As severity of illness increases, the margin for error in initial antimicrobial therapy diminishes and this requires consideration of coverage against multiple patterns of bacterial resistance.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE organisms: cause, clinical features, and management [^9166fd53]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes. Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens.

Recent Findings

Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion β-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens.

Summary

VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli coverage emphasizes initial antipseudomonal activity and stratified breadth. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days; also see Remarks) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### Managing Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis [^3539765c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current guidelines and recent clinical research in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) are reviewed. Areas where further research is required will also be highlighted.

Recent Findings

P. aeruginosa is a key respiratory pathogen in CF. Inhaled tobramycin or colistin is recommended for early eradication to prevent establishment of chronic infection. Other antibiotic options are currently being investigated. The long-term success of eradication strategies is also now being assessed. The use of inhaled antibiotics in the management of chronic P. aeruginosa infection is an area of active investigation. Acute pulmonary exacerbations are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Guidelines continue to recommend combination intravenous therapy but further research is required to clarify the advantage of this approach. Multidrug resistance is common and potentially more effective antipseudomonal antibiotics may soon become available.

Summary

The management of P. aeruginosa respiratory infection in CF remains a challenging area, especially in the setting of multidrug resistance. The role of inhaled antibiotics continues to be expanded. Further research is required in the key areas of eradication and management of chronic infection and acute pulmonary exacerbations to identify those treatments that optimize long-term, clinical benefits.

### Therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia. A patient-based approach based on the ten rules of "The tarragona strategy" [^92cbeed4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia should be a patient-based approach focusing on some key features are listed here: early initial therapy should be based on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Empirical treatment may be targeted after direct staining and should be modified according to good-quality quantitative microbiological findings, but should never be withdrawn in presence of negative direct staining or delayed until microbiological results are available. Courses of therapy should be given at high doses according to pharmacodynamic and tissue penetration properties. Prolonging antibiotic treatment does not prevent recurrences. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus should be expected in comatose patients. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should not be expected in patients without previous antibiotic coverage. Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be covered with combination therapy. Antifungal therapy, even when Candida spp is isolated in significant concentrations, is not recommended for intubated nonneutropenic patients. Vancomycin, given at the standard doses and route of administration for the treatment of VAP caused by Gram-positive pathogens, is associated with poor outcomes. The choice of initial antibiotic should be based on the patient's previous antibiotic exposure and comorbidities, and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns, which should be updated regularly.

### Clinical features, diagnostics, etiology, and outcomes of hospitalized solid organ recipients with community-acquired pneumonia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^3d5f1db8]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding epidemiology, we found that patients with previous Pseudomonas species chronic infection (which in our setting were patients transplanted due to CF bronchiectasis or non-CF bronchiectasis) were at high risk for Pseudomonas species pneumonia. A minority of lung transplant recipients without prior chronic infection developed Pseudomonas species pneumonia, possibly reflecting the risk of chronic lung damage due to bronchiectasis or chronic allograft dysfunction after lung transplant (e-Table 3). Chronic lung damage and prior colonization have been identified as the main predictors of Pseudomonas species pneumonia in immunocompetent patients and could be used to guide empirical antibiotic therapy. Moreover, the burden of antibiotic resistance was highest in patients with known colonization with resistant organisms, and the remaining core respiratory bacteria reflected local epidemiology. This should be considered when starting empirical therapy and could be used to tailor stewardship interventions. Nonetheless, a pathogen was found in only one-half of hospitalizations, leaving an epidemiologic black box with unclear implications for management and outcomes.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the high cardiovascular comorbidity and complication burden in hospitalized patients with CAP after transplant. Although the risk of acute and long-term cardiovascular complications in hospitalized immunocompetent patients with CAP has been described, our understanding of this phenomenon is still limited, and no risk reduction strategies exist. A recently published study by Müller-Plathe et alevaluating risk scores for severe pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients with CAP reported a lower in-hospital mortality rate than in this cohort. However, the analysis excluded patients with signs of acute heart failure at presentation. This exclusion might indirectly suggest grave implications for mortality in this patient group.

Our study's limitations are related to its retrospective design: as previously mentioned, we face a high risk of bias by indication regarding diagnostics and therapy. Although the higher rate of Pseudomonas species pneumonia in lung transplant recipients might be due to detection bias in a population in which bronchoscopies were often performed, similar data have already been published. Because we performed a single-center analysis, there is a risk of case-mix bias. There might be significant differences in severity between patients admitted at our center and patients who might have received care at hospitals closest to their homes. This discrepancy could explain the higher mortality rate compared with other transplant cohorts. On the other hand, others have excluded patients with acute cardiac failure at the time of admission for CAP, thus possibly including a selection bias in their analysis. Another limitation is that we did not have access to reliable data on immunization status against respiratory infections.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — aminoglycosides and polymyxins rationale: The aminoglycosides are the only exceptions with regard to the panel not making a recommendation for or against a specific antibiotic class in HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, and the panel chose to recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy for 2 reasons; first, aminoglycosides penetrate the lung poorly, requiring high peak serum concentrations to achieve alveolar activity, which increases the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and studies have found no detectable antipseudomonal activity within bronchial secretions despite therapeutic serum levels; second, there is a lack of studies evaluating aminoglycoside monotherapy in HAP/VAP. Occasionally, routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing identifies no antibiotics to which P. aeruginosa is susceptible, intravenous polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) may be an option, and the panel agreed that polymyxin susceptibility should be routinely assessed for Pseudomonas isolates in settings with a high prevalence of extensively resistant organisms; the panel also recognized that as many as two-thirds of patients with HAP/VAP caused by P. aeruginosa have antibiotic resistance.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa — definitive monotherapy versus combination therapy: Evidence syntheses found no differences between monotherapy and combination therapy for definitive treatment, and the panel felt strongly that, in the absence of any demonstrable benefit, the costs and potential side effects of an additional antibiotic were not warranted; therefore, the recommendation is strong despite the low quality of evidence. An exception is that combination therapy is warranted as definitive therapy for patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who have septic shock or a high risk for death, based upon evidence that combination therapy was associated with decreased mortality among patients with pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Background data cited include an initial meta-analysis of Pseudomonas bacteremia showing benefit with combination therapy (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–.79) and a large observational analysis showing no reduction in 30-day mortality with combination therapy versus monotherapy (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95% CI, .73–2.47).

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — antipseudomonal selection and avoidance guidance: For patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units (ICUs) where ≤ 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to the agent considered for monotherapy, we suggest prescribing one antibiotic active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In suspected VAP, we suggest avoiding aminoglycosides if alternative gram-negative agents are available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) and we suggest avoiding colistin if alternatives with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The panel selected a 10%–20% threshold for deciding whether to target methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a 10% threshold for choosing 1 vs 2 antipseudomonal agents with the goal to assure that ≥ 95% of patient receive active empiric therapy; individual ICUs may modify these thresholds, and if the patient has structural lung disease increasing risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### Gram-negative bacterial resistance: evolving patterns and treatment paradigms [^ee82e57c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends primarily on providing adequate initial antibiotic treatment in a timely manner, because an inappropriate course is closely associated with increased mortality. Gram-negative bacteria are commonly responsible for nosocomial pneumonia, and the increasing prevalence of drug resistance among these bacteria complicates decision making with regard to treatment with antibiotics. Infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly problematic because of their intrinsic resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics and their ability to acquire adaptive resistance during a therapeutic course. Numerous strategies, including the use of combination therapy followed by de-escalation of antibiotics, have shown promise in the treatment of these serious infections. However, future success in treating nosocomial infections depends on the appropriate and responsible use of antibiotics in the intensive care unit, to ensure that the antibiotics available today maintain their effectiveness in the future.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric antipseudomonal therapy — For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For those with factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa, and we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks add that if a patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and that the 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA may be modified by individual units.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia: one size does not fit all [^8705e0b1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Indeed, recent advances have demonstrated the importance of virulence factors in PSA infections. Although several different mechanisms such as quorum sensing and biofilm formation have been reported, the TTSS, encoded by PSA, has become one of the most important and widely studied virulence factors. After the microorganism has come into contact with the cell, the needle-like TTSS mechanism allows the bacteria to inject toxins directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell, evading direct recognition by the host's immune system. Recent studies suggest that failure to eradicate PSA in patients with VAP may be linked to TTSS. Patients infected with Pseudomonas sp. strains which express at least one type of TTSS protein (TTSS +) at the onset of VAP are more likely to have recovered at day 8 post-VAP, whereas eradication is achieved in patients with undetectable levels of TTSS proteins. The transfer of our knowledge of the virulence factors to the clinical setting is crucial in order to evaluate the potential of virulence factor-directed therapies.

In view of the mortality associated with PSA-VAP and the frequency of inadequate initial empiric therapy, these findings underscore the need for a different management paradigm with effective anti-pseudomonal vaccines for prophylaxis of patients at risk and the need for rapid diagnostic test methods and monoclonal-specific antibodies blocking virulence factors in patients with VAP.

We have also learned that association of virulence factors is a variable that splits P. aeruginosa in two phenotypes, with the possibility of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy for management of virulent strains. A combination of general risk factors and molecular diagnosis techniques may identify suitable candidates for intervention. As in invasive pneumococcal infections, further research is required to identify potential associations of comorbidities and serotypes as well as of serotypes and specific complications.

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### About Pseudomonas aeruginosa… [^602a9af1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections typically occur in healthcare settings.
- Good hand hygiene and infection prevention and control can help reduce the risk of infection. P. aeruginosacan be resistant to antibiotics, making these infections difficult to treat. Overview Pseudomonas is a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. The most common type causing infections among humans is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa can cause infections in the blood, lungs, urinary tract, or other parts of the body after surgery. Antimicrobial resistance Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, including carbapenems, known as multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. In 2017, MDR P. aeruginosa caused an estimated 32, 600 infections among hospitalized patients and 2, 700 estimated deaths in the United States.

At-risk populations Patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk, especially those who:

- Are on breathing machines.
- Have devices such as catheters.
- Have open wounds from surgery or burns. How it spreads
- Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment.
- Exposure in the soil or water.
- Person-to-person contact, like from contaminated hands. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers
- Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
- Remind people to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
- Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting. Healthcare settings
- Always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
- Have water management plans in place. Testing To determine if someone has a P.

aeruginosa infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Treatment and recovery Treatment generally includes antibiotics. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited for MDR P. aeruginosa.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to gram-negative bacilli — adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy is selectively recommended and supported by limited outcomes data: When only the trials that evaluated clinical cure were pooled, the clinical cure rate similarly improved (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11–1.47); one trial found that inhaled antibiotics reduced the frequency of requiring additional intravenous antibiotics, and two studies reported that inhaled colistin reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation. The panel elected to recommend adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy for patients who are most likely to benefit: specifically, those who have VAP caused by bacteria that are only susceptible to the classes of antibiotics of which evidence of efficacy by the intravenous route is the most limited (ie, aminoglycosides or colistin), and it is reasonable to consider adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy as a treatment of last resort for patients who are not responding to intravenous antibiotics alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not MDR. The rationale notes that antibiotic efficacy against bacteria within purulent secretions may require antibiotic concentrations > 10–25 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), that with high-dose intravenous colistin the concentration in the serum is approximately the MIC of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas while concentrations in the lung and airway are lower and, therefore, subtherapeutic, and that the ongoing use of antibiotics at subtherapeutic levels may lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### What is the most effective antibiotic monotherapy for severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a057115a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Severe infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. Determining the optimal definitive monotherapy for these infections is critical. The main objective was to compile the evidence of subgroups of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection from randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating different definite antipseudomonal monotherapies for severe P. aeruginosa infection.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs that assessed monotherapy with an antipseudomonal drug versus another antipseudomonal for definite treatment, and reported on the subgroup of patients with P. aeruginosa infection. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, LILACS and the reference lists of included trials. Eligibility criteria included RCTs enrolling hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with microbiologically confirmed severe P. aeruginosa infections. Studies were excluded if they included > 20% of patients receiving combination therapy or if patients had resistant P. aeruginosa strains at recruitment. Antipseudomonal drugs evaluated included cephalosporins, carbapenems, penicillins, quinolones and aztreonam. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Results were pooled using fixed-effects and random-effects models as appropriate. Relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs were calculated. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed when data were available.

Results

A total of 76 RCTs and 1681 patients with pseudomonal infection were included. Due to the low number of studies which reported our outcomes of interest, all subgroup analyses were underpowered. No difference in all-cause mortality was found for any direct antibiotic comparison. Higher clinical failure rates of carbapenems versus piperacillin-tazobactam were observed for pneumonia in two RCTs (RR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.29–5.03; I² = 0%, n = 2), and higher microbiological failure rates with carbapenems versus other comparators (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.51; I² = 0%, n = 23). Patients treated with imipenem were more likely to develop resistance to the study drug versus comparators (RR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.61–3.38; I² = 0%, n = 7).

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of definite antipseudomonal monotherapy for P. aeruginosa infection, we found no evidence of clinical benefit differences among direct antibiotic comparisons, but all subgroup analyses were underpowered to detect significant differences.

### Severe pneumonia in intensive care: cause, diagnosis, treatment and management: a review of the literature [^356e3c3d]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe pneumonia is a common disease that intensive care physicians have to face. The review highlights recent findings about microbiology, diagnosis and treatment, including the management of critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological and clinical risk factors strongly influence microbiological cause in patients with severe pneumonia. In addition to typical respiratory pathogens, less common microrganisms and multidrug-resistant (MDR) germs may cause severe lung infections. New molecular diagnostic techniques appear promising for early detection of microbes involved in severe pneumonia. Antimicrobials remain the mainstay of causative severe pneumonia treatment and the optimization of antibiotic therapy may be obtained by applying their pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties. Several new strategies have been implemented for the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to severe pneumonia; however, their extensive clinical application is limited by the need for well trained physicians and adequate hospital centers.

Summary

Despite advancements in antibiotic and life-supportive treatments, severe pneumonia remains a leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential. The use of new nonconventional strategies for ARF management might be effective in more severe patients.

### Imipenem resistance of Pseudomonas in pneumonia: a systematic literature review [^408920f8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, pooling observations from clinical trials occurring over a 15-year period we computed the cumulative PA resistance rate to imipenem to be in the range of 50%, persisting in many sensitivity analyses. The 15% resistance rate at baseline further stresses the importance of risk stratification at bedside and the need to employ early appropriate therapy to improve patient outcomes. The additional 39% resistance development on treatment is also sobering, implying that 1) clinicians employing early broad spectrum coverage need to pay exquisite attention to prompt de-escalation if such coverage is not needed, and 2) researchers need to focus on developing novel therapies whose mechanisms of action may be less subject to the microbial adaptation apparatus. In all, our data add to the epidemiologic alarm of PA resistance and help further sound the call to arrive at strategies that balance patient outcomes with the growing public health threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Pseudomonas skin infection: clinical features, epidemiology, and management [^5e235c85]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacillus that is most frequently associated with opportunistic infection, but which can also present in the otherwise healthy patient. The range of P. aeruginosa infections varies from localized infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic disease. Many P. aeruginosa infections are marked by characteristic cutaneous manifestations. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge of cutaneous manifestations of P. aeruginosa infection with specific emphasis on clinical features and management. The ability of P. aeruginosa to rapidly acquire antibacterial resistance is an increasingly well recognized phenomenon, and the correct application of antipseudomonal therapy is therefore of the utmost importance. A detailed discussion of currently available anti-pseudomonal agents is included, and the benefits of antimicrobial combination therapy versus monotherapy are explored. Rapid clinical recognition of P. aeruginosa infection aided by the identification of characteristic cutaneous manifestations can play a critical role in the successful management of potentially life-threatening disease.

Early- versus late-onset VAP and colonization dynamics — colonization patterns in the upper and lower airways changed within the first 3–4 days from a community-like to a typical nosocomial pattern, and some reports indicate the threshold may be extended to 7 days. Several subsequent studies found no significant differences between pathogen patterns in early and late VAP. This emphasizes the need for judicious selection of patients for antibiotic therapy.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — observational data on empiric versus definitive therapy: Two observational studies specifically in P. aeruginosa VAP were identified, including a multicenter cohort with "183 episodes of VAP caused by P. aeruginosa" in which "Inappropriate empiric therapy was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.07–3.10), and the initial use of combination therapy reduced the likelihood of inappropriate therapy", and after excluding inappropriate empiric treatment, mortality was "similar among those who received definitive treatment using monotherapy and combination therapy (23.1% vs 33.2%; adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, .50–1.63)". A single-center study "enrolled 100 consecutive patients with bacteremic P. aeruginosa pneumonia" and reported that all-cause 28-day mortality "was associated with the absence of septic shock at the time of bacteremia (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, .01–.49) and adequate combination therapy (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, .01–.34)". Overall, "The observational studies suggest that combination therapy is beneficial for initial empiric therapy; however, once the antibiotic susceptibilities are known, there are no differences in outcome among patients who receive definitive treatment using monotherapy or combination therapy", although "there is a possibility that a subset of patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia complicated by septic shock may benefit from combination therapy", with the panel noting confidence "was also low because they were based upon observational studies".

### Pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: part I: epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and source [^696a3757]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Controversies exist for diagnostic methods and antibiotic therapy. We review the epidemiology of CAP, including that in patients with HIV and also in hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bronchoscope-associated pneumonia. We performed a literature review of clinical studies involving P aeruginosa pneumonia with an emphasis on treatment and prevention. Pneumonia due to P aeruginosa occurs in several distinct syndromes: (1) CAP, usually in patients with chronic lung disease; (2) hospital-acquired pneumonia, usually occurring in the ICU; and (3) bacteremic P aeruginosa pneumonia, usually in the neutropenic host. Radiologic manifestations are nonspecific. Colonization with P aeruginosa in COPD and in hospitalized patients is a well established phenomenon such that treatment based on respiratory tract cultures may lead to overtreatment. We present circumstantial evidence that the incidence of P aeruginosa has been overestimated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and reflex administration of empirical antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy may be unnecessary. A diagnostic approach with BAL and protected specimen brush using quantitative cultures for patients with VAP led to a decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotic use and improved outcome. Endotracheal aspirate cultures with quantitative counts are commonly used, but validation is lacking. An empirical approach using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score is a pragmatic approach that minimizes antibiotic resistance and leads to decreased mortality in patients in the ICU. The source of the P aeruginosa may be endogenous (from respiratory or GI tract colonization) or exogenous from tap water in hospital-acquired pneumonia. The latter source is amenable to preventive measures.

### Management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia: one size does not fit all [^0757ccfa]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In the previous issue of Critical Care, Lu and colleagues reported a visionary study assessing the distribution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) serotypes in patients with ICU pneumonia and suggested differences in outcomes depending on serotypes. In this report, serotype O6 predominated, being associated with better clinical outcomes than serotype 011, which were frequently producing toxins secreted by the type III secretion system (TTSS). These findings have important implications for both clinical practice and future studies.

In an international study of over 1,200 ICUs in 75 countries, the risk of infections, including those due to Pseudomonas species, was found to increase with duration of ICU stay; in addition, infection was associated with an increased risk of mortality. In 2014, at a time when multidrug-resistant clones are emerging and represent a strong risk of dissemination, we have much more information on Pseudomonas pneumonia management. We know that one effective agent is equivalent to two but that initial combination followed by de-escalation improves survival by reducing the risk of delay in appropriate therapy. We know that resolution of episodes with appropriate therapy is similar to core pathogens but that wrong initial therapy is associated with a resolution similar to that of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Pulsed-field electrophoresis analysis performed in an ICU with a high prevalence of PSA identified the genotypes of more than 1,700 isolates. Interestingly, the most frequently isolated clones were responsible for gut or skin colonization, in addition to respiratory colonization, but were only rarely associated with pneumonia. When ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was present, most patients achieved clinical resolution without major consequences. On the other hand, non-related clones suggestive of prior colonization were associated with a very high mortality rate. Most clonally related isolates caused gastric colonization before skin or respiratory tract colonization, suggesting an association with the tap water used in the administration of medication. These findings emphasize that different risk factors may be implicated depending on whether the clone is due to exogenous contamination or or as endogenous colonization from being a carrier. Therefore, conventional identification provided by the microbiology laboratory results is insufficient for assessing the patient and effective management.

Infection of the lower respiratory tract is a potentially severe or life-threatening illness. Taking the right steps to recognize, identify, and treat pneumonia is critical to improving patient outcomes. An awareness of the diversity of potential infectious causes, the local endemic flora and resistance patterns, as well as testing strategies to differentiate causes of pneumonia is essential to providing the best patient outcomes. Understanding surveillance definitions allow intensivists to become partners in reducing hospital-associated infections and improving quality of care.

Exacerbation monitoring/management

An exacerbation can be defined as a significant worsening of symptoms over several days, which may include an increase in the frequency of cough, shortness of breath, increase of sputum volume, viscosity and/or purulence. In the outpatient setting, assessments of exacerbations should include the history, a clinical examination, a sputum sample for culture prior to beginning antibiotic treatment and a review of previous sputum microbial analyses.

Medications should be chosen based on current and previous bacteriological results. For exacerbations that are not severe, oral antibiotics are appropriate. Standardised courses of antibiotics(14 days) are recommended for all patients with exacerbations owing to the higher airway bacterial loads observed in bronchiectasis. Antibiotic prescribing is variable in the United States and among European countries. – Recent guidelines suggest that coordinated efforts to develop antibiotic stewardship programs can help to minimise the development of antibiotic resistance.

Patients requiring intravenous antibiotics include those with severe infections requiring hospital admission, patients with organisms resistant to oral antibiotic agents (most frequently P. aeruginosa resistant to ciprofloxacin or other multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms) or patients who have failed to improve with 14 days of targeted oral antibiotics. Patients with respiratory failure, confusion, haemodynamic instability or large volume haemoptysis will require admission to hospital. Small volume haemoptysis is relatively common in bronchiectasis and may simply require antibiotic therapy. Patients experiencing haemoptysis for the first time should be evaluated by a specialist and patients with large volume haemoptysis (e.g. > 100 ml), or haemoptysis with hypoxaemia or haemodynamic instability should be referred to hospital.

Although most often administered to hospitalised patients, intravenous antibiotics have been shown to be effective and safe when administered at home, after proper instruction.

P. aeruginosa eradication

P. aeruginosa is a special case because of its strong impact on prognosis. When P. aeruginosa is isolated for the first time in patients with bronchiectasis most international guidelines recommend attempting to eradicate the organism when isolated for the first time in sputum. Our recommendation for primary care is to send sputum samples for stable patients at least once per year, and preferably more often. In the event of a first positive sample for P. aeruginosa, patients should send a further sample for culture, and treat with oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily for 14 days. A repeat sputum sample should be sent after antibiotics to determine if the treatment has been successful and the patient should be referred to a specialist who will determine whether to add intravenous or inhaled antibiotics to the regime.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia — HIV-infected children without combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and those with chronic lung disease have worse outcomes and typical bacterial causes. Acute pneumonia, often presumptively diagnosed in children, was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality in HIV-infected children in one study during the pre-cART era, and HIV-infected children not receiving cART who present with pneumonia are more likely to be bacteremic and to die than are HIV-uninfected children with pneumonia. Children with chronic lung disease, including bronchiectasis or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, are more susceptible to infectious exacerbations caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas spp.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^0967dbb5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48-72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

Cystic fibrosis — management when initial eradication of newly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa fails: Although inhaled tobramycin therapy is very effective, it is not always successful, so most clinicians would advocate additional therapy to attempt eradication before committing individuals to chronic suppressive antibiotics; additional or other inhaled, oral, or intravenous antibiotics could be a reasonable next step, deciding when to move from episodic eradication to chronic inhaled antibiotics is also important, and there are no studies directly addressing optimal subsequent therapy, though a European expert panel has proposed a potential framework for additional therapy when an initial eradication attempt fails.

### Pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: part II: antimicrobial resistance, pharmacodynamic concepts, and antibiotic therapy [^c6bf0378]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa carries a notably higher mortality rate than other pneumonia pathogens. Because of its multiple mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, therapy has always been challenging. This problem has been magnified in recent years with the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens often unharmed by almost all classes of antimicrobials. The objective of this article is to assess optimal antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro activity, animal studies, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) observations so that evidence-based recommendations can be developed to maximize favorable clinical outcomes. Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance of P aeruginosa are reviewed. A selective literature review of laboratory studies, PK/PD concepts, and controlled clinical trials of antibiotic therapy directed at P aeruginosa pneumonia was performed. P aeruginosa possesses multiple mechanisms for inducing antibiotic resistance to antimicrobial agents. Continuous infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotics enhances bacterial killing. Although the advantages of combination therapy remain contentious, in vitro and animal model studies plus selected meta-analyses of clinical trials support its use, especially in the era of MDR. Colistin use and the role of antibiotic aerosolization are reviewed. An evidence-based algorithmic approach based on severity of illness, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score, and combination antibiotic therapy is presented; clinical outcomes may be improved, and the emergence of MDR pathogens should be minimized with this approach.

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia: risk factors, microbiology, and treatment [^985d6c1d]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia complicates hospitalization in 0.5 to 2.0% of patients and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) include mechanical ventilation for > 48 h, residence in an ICU, duration of ICU or hospital stay, severity of underlying illness, and presence of comorbidities. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter are the most common causes of HAP. Nearly half of HAP cases are polymicrobial. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria assume increasing importance. Optimal therapy for HAP should take into account severity of illness, demographics, specific pathogens involved, and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance. When P aeruginosa is implicated, monotherapy, even with broad-spectrum antibiotics, is associated with rapid evolution of resistance and a high rate of clinical failures. For pseudomonal HAP, we advise combination therapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin).

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^4f98e4af]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, and the prognosis is important in determining the site of care. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, but the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection. Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis; however, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory items can help estimate the short-term risk for death and, along with the patient's psychosocial characteristics, determine the appropriate site of treatment.

Drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (DTR P. aeruginosa) pneumonia — nebulized antibiotics as adjunctive therapy: Three clinical trials in ventilator-associated pneumonia enrolled 100, 142, and 508 adults with pneumonia with 34%, 22%, and 32% caused by P. aeruginosa, respectively, and none demonstrated improved clinical outcomes or survival; a meta-analysis of 13 trials including 1733 adults indicated at least partial resolution of clinical symptoms but no overall differences in the duration of unit length of stay, or reduction in ventilator days. The panel suggests against the use of nebulized antibiotics as adjunctive therapy for DTR P. aeruginosa pneumonia due to the lack of benefit in clinical trials and concerns regarding unequal distribution in infected lungs and respiratory complications such as bronchoconstriction.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^74c41942]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to sputum cultures (inpatient setting), ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions in adult patients with CAP managed in the hospital setting with any of the following:

- being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa

- previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially with prior respiratory tract infection

- hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^8c270847]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^8e3d2762]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment strategy in cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations: The standard approach to antibiotic treatment of P. aeruginosa in patients with CF has been to use two antipseudomonal drugs to enhance activity and reduce selection of resistant organisms, yet the use of combination antibiotic therapy with synergistic activity in vitro has not been shown to result in improved clinical outcomes; upon analysis, the committee determined that there remains insufficient evidence addressing this important question, and the trials did not demonstrate compelling evidence that the two therapies are equivalent or to support one therapy over the other; nevertheless, the Committee feels the comparison of monotherapy with combination therapy is a question worthy of further investigation, and although the Committee recognizes that the use of combination antibiotic therapy has not been validated in the treatment of CF lung infections, the standard of care has been to use combination antibiotics as treatment of P. aeruginosa.

### Infectious pulmonary diseases [^0f481abf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by the inability to clear pathogens from the lower airway and alveoli. Cytokines and local inflammatory markers are released, causing further damage to the lungs through the accumulation of white blood cells and fluid congestion, leading to pus in the parenchyma. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines pneumonia as the presence of new lung infiltrate with other clinical evidence supporting infection, including new fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. Importantly, lower respiratory infections remain the most deadly communicable disease. Pneumonia is subdivided into three categories: (1) community acquired, (2) hospital acquired, and (3) ventilator associated. Therapy for each differs based on the severity of the disease and the presence of risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Necrotizing pneumonia (aetiology, clinical features and management) [^b3768067]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by rapid progression of consolidation to necrosis and cavitation which may lead to pulmonary gangrene. Morbidity and mortality are high and chronic sequelae are frequent. The lack of guidance supports the review of the latest recommendations in the management of these pneumonias.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic therapy alone may not be enough to alter the course of the infection, and regimens, adjunctive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulins, surgery may be required to alter the course of the disease especially with pulmonary gangrene.

Summary

The causative agents, clinical features and management of necrotizing pneumonias are discussed.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^333ff27b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

HOSPITAL-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA

In developed countries, the concept of hospital-associated pneumonia is well established. In developing countries, although data are extremely sparse, there is no reason to suppose that hospital-associated infections are any less common. The pattern of pathogens causing hospital-associated pneumonia is characteristically different from that causing community-acquired pneumonia, with greater representation of gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and greater prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistance. The objective of the PERCH study is to provide etiologic information to guide prevention and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and we therefore modified the case definition to exclude children who have been admitted overnight to any hospital within the last 14 days.

A related problem is the development of pneumonia among children who have already been admitted to hospital. If this occurs 48 hours after admission, it is normally considered hospital-associated. However, some children who present at the early stages of an episode of pneumonia do not manifest all of the clinical signs necessary to diagnose the condition but develop them over the next 24–48 hours. This is a relatively infrequent occurrence and it would require considerably more resources to ascertain than a study targeted on the admission assessment. Furthermore, the project seeks to guide the admission management of community-acquired pneumonia, and these cases cannot contribute to that guidance. Therefore, we did not include them in PERCH.

Cystic fibrosis — determining therapy for newly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa: The committee notes there may be several effective strategies and has recommended a specific eradication strategy that must be tailored to the individual clinical situation, and to date direct comparison of regimens has not identified a clearly superior approach. Ongoing studies include one that compares the benefit 3 months of inhaled colistin combined with either 2 weeks of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin or 3 months of oral ciprofloxacin, and the OPTIMIZE study, an 18-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the addition of chronic thrice-weekly oral azithromycin versus placebo to standardized inhaled tobramycin therapy for children with early infection; additional comparative effectiveness studies will be important to determine the optimal eradication therapy.

Pneumonia: initial empiric therapy for CAP, HAP, VAP

Severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). For patients without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) infection, the currently recommended initial empiric therapy is (a) beta-lactam plus a macrolide or (b) beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (FQ), both of which are acceptable, although more evidence favors a beta-lactam/macrolide. While evidence supporting these recommendations is based upon observational studies, a meta-analysis and systematic review found improved mortality for treatment with beta-lactam/macrolide over a beta -lactam/FQ, especially with severe CAP. There are not sufficient data to recommend treatment with FQ monotherapy or a beta-lactam plus doxycycline in severe CAP.

Patients with risk factors for MRSA or PSA might have been characterized as healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in the past, but his term has been abandoned. Multiple studies demonstrated that HCAP risk factors did not necessarily predict the presence of resistant organisms and that coverage for these organisms did not improve clinical outcomes. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommends empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage for CAP patients with risk factors for these pathogens, followed by de-escalation of therapy, if cultures are negative. The best risk factors for MRSA and PSA infection are previous growth of these pathogens, as well as recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic exposure (within 90 days). The development of validated scoring systems that accurately predict risk for these pathogens has proven difficult, as have efforts to develop locally validated risk factors. Empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage in severe CAP, with de-escalation, has proven to be a safe strategy. However, a recent study found a low overall rate of de-escalation in the setting of negative cultures, providing an opportunity to improve antibiotic use. Possible empiric regimens recommended for MRSA pneumonia include vancomycin or linezolid. Therapy for PSA includes piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, meropenem, or imipenem. Newer agents may also have a role.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^7c644afb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia in previously healthy adults: case report and review of the literature [^60f2a62c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

We report a case of rapidly fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a previously healthy 67-year-old woman. Eleven published case reports of P. aeruginosa CAP in previously healthy adults are reviewed. According to our review, the mean age of affected patients is 45.3 years. Five patients described in the literature were smokers with a mean smoking history of 40 pack-years. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, and although the pneumonia can be rapidly fatal, only 33% of the patients who were reported died. However, mortality may be independent of treatment within the first 36 hours of presentation. Exposure to aerosols of contaminated water is a risk factor for P. aeruginosa CAP in this population. Pseudomonas CAP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for anyone with a smoking history who presents with rapidly progressive pneumonia. We discuss treatment recommendations that are based on evidence in the currently available literature on the subject.

### Pathogen-host interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia [^205b2a7a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen causing a wide range of acute and chronic infections. P. aeruginosa rarely causes infection in the normal host, but is an efficient opportunistic pathogen causing serious infections in patients who are mechanically ventilated, individuals who are immunocompromised, and patients with malignancies or HIV infection. Among these risk groups, the most vulnerable hosts are neutropenic and patients who are mechanically ventilated. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent chronic infection contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Because of the ubiquitous nature of P. aeruginosa and its ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, it continues to be problematic from a treatment perspective. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa is largely caused by multiple bacterial virulence factors and genetic flexibility enabling it to survive in varied environments. Lung injury associated with P. aeruginosa infection results from both the direct destructive effects of the organism on the lung parenchyma and exuberant host immune responses. This article focuses on the major bacterial virulence factors and important aspects of the host immunity that are involved in the pathogenesis of serious P. aeruginosa infection. In addition to antibiotic therapy, strategies directed toward enhancing host defense and/or limiting excessive inflammation could be important to improve outcome in P. aeruginosa lung infections.

### Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^e193c20f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs in most people with cystic fibrosis. Once chronic infection is established, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006 and 2009.

Objectives

To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in children and adults with cystic fibrosis eradicates the organism, delays the onset of chronic infection, and results in clinical improvement. To evaluate whether there is evidence that a particular antibiotic strategy is superior to or more cost-effective than other strategies and to compare the adverse effects of different antibiotic strategies (including respiratory infection with other micro-organisms).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 08 September 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of people with cystic fibrosis, in whom Pseudomonas aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics. We excluded non-randomised trials, cross-over trials, and those utilising historical controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

The search identified 49 trials; seven trials (744 participants) with a duration between 28 days and 27 months were eligible for inclusion. Three of the trials are over 10 years old and their results may be less applicable today given the changes in standard treatment. Some of the trials had low numbers of participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods; however, there was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment given the interventions and comparators used. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. Evidence from two trials (38 participants) at the two-month time-point showed treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection with inhaled tobramycin results in microbiological eradication of the organism from respiratory secretions more often than placebo, odds ratio 0.15 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.65) and data from one of these trials, with longer follow up, suggested that this effect may persist for up to 12 months. One randomised controlled trial (26 participants) compared oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin versus usual treatment. Results after two years suggested treatment of early infection results in microbiological eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa more often than no anti-pseudomonal treatment, odds ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.79). One trial comparing 28 days to 56 days treatment with nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation in 88 participants showed that both treatments were effective and well-tolerated, with no notable additional improvement with longer over shorter duration of therapy. However, this trial was not powered to detect non-inferiority or equivalence. A trial of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation alone (223 participants) failed to show a difference between the two strategies, although it was underpowered to show this. A further trial of inhaled colistin with oral ciprofloxacin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation with oral ciprofloxacin also showed no superiority of the former, with increased isolation of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in both groups. A recent, large trial in 306 children aged between one and 12 years compared cycled nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. The primary analysis showed no difference in time to pulmonary exacerbation or proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive cultures. An analysis performed in this review (not adjusted for age) showed fewer participants in the cycled therapy group with one or more isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.28).

Authors' Conclusions

We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or in combination with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eradication may be sustained for up to two years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotic strategies for the eradication of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials of two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There have been no published randomised controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Overall, there is still insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis.

### A practical guide to the diagnosis and management of suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the United Kingdom [^7e1f7b0e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Referral and diagnosis

Once an initial positive NTM culture has been identified, patients should be discussed with secondary care for further assessment. If significant symptoms and imaging features are present, then the typical next step would be a formal review in the specialty clinic. If the culture finding was incidental or unexpected, repeat sampling and a discussion may be more appropriate in the first instance.

The key clinical question at this point is whether the first positive culture is coincidental to the patient's health or whether it represents NTM-PD and a reason for the observed respiratory symptoms. The secondary care assessment should take into account the clinical, microbiological (number and source of positive cultures) and radiological features of the patient's condition in deciding if this may represent NTM-PD and therefore whether treatment should be offered.

In the UK, patients with NTM-PD are identified through various settings, including respiratory clinics, emergency hospital admissions, and lung cancer multidisciplinary teams/fast-track referrals. Fewer are identified from screening in primary care. Most patients with a new positive culture are referred to the local respiratory service for further assessment unless they have known complex disease such as CF or bronchiectasis and are already receiving specialist respiratory care.

Guidelines from the UK British Thoracic Society (BTS)agree on the need for the three major components of clinical features to be present, composed of symptoms, microbiology (positive cultures), and radiology (consistent imaging features on CT) to diagnose NTM-PD. Microbiological criteria include ≥ 2 sputum samples, or a single positive culture from biopsy or a bronchoalveolar lavage. Therefore, referral to secondary care should be simultaneously supported with ≥ 2 further requests for sputum mycobacteria culture. Radiological criteria are more difficult to define with certainty; consistent imaging features include nodular or cavitary structures on chest radiograph, nodular bronchiectasis or fibrocavitary appearances against a background of bronchiectasis on CT. During these investigations, it is important to assess for alternative or contributing causes of the presenting symptoms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus spp. tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. The NTM UK network is currently exploring a structured radiology reporting process which could improve recognition of new disease and management of known NTM-PD on treatment.

### Optimal management therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia: an observational, multicenter study comparing monotherapy with combination antibiotic therapy [^2d58c5d0]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether one antibiotic achieves equal outcomes compared with combination antibiotic therapy in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

A retrospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study.

Setting

Five intensive care units in Spanish university hospitals.

Patients

Adult patients identified to have monomicrobial episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia with significant quantitative respiratory cultures for P. aeruginosa.

Interventions

None.

Measurement and Main Results

A total of 183 episodes of monomicrobial P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia were analyzed. Monotherapy alone was used empirically in 67 episodes, being significantly associated with inappropriate therapy (56.7% vs. 90.5%, p < .001). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the 40 patients with inappropriate therapy compared with those at least on antibiotic with activity in vitro (72.5% vs. 23.1%, p < .05). Excess mortality associated with monotherapy was estimated to be 13.6% (95% confidence interval -2.6 to 29.9). The use of monotherapy or combination therapy in the definitive regimen did not influence mortality, length of stay, development of resistance to the definitive treatment, or appearance of recurrences. Inappropriate empirical therapy was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.85; 95% confidence interval 1.07–3.10; p = .02) in a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, after adjustment for disease severity, but not effective monotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.50–1.63; p = .73) compared with effective combination therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 1). The other two variables also independently associated with mortality were age (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.04; p = .005) and chronic cardiac insufficiency (adjusted hazard ratio 1.90; 95% confidence interval 1.04–3.47; p = .035).

Conclusions

Initial use of combination therapy significantly reduces the likelihood of inappropriate therapy, which is associated with higher risk of death. However, administration of only one effective antimicrobial or combination therapy provides similar outcomes, suggesting that switching to monotherapy once the susceptibility is documented is feasible and safe.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.
