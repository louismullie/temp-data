## Question

An 80-year-old male comes to the clinic due to chest pain for the past 8 months. He describes a pressure-like sensation in the middle of his chest that is brought on by walking. It lasts 2–3 minutes and subsides with rest. The patient has not had shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or lower extremity swelling. Medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is a smoker with a 25- pack-year smoking history. Blood pressure is 145/82 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. Echocardiogram mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and an ejection fraction of 62%. No valvular abnormalities are noted. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's current symptoms?

Coronary artery disease

Left ventricular hypertrophy

Obstructive lung disease

Valvular aortic stenosis

Vasospastic angina

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition is most likely responsible for exertional chest pressure in an 80-year-old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 25–pack-year smoking history, and wants to understand why alternatives like left ventricular hypertrophy, obstructive lung disease, aortic stenosis, and vasospastic angina are less likely explanations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chest pain phenotype and whether it matches classic angina. Then, I should verify how the patient's risk factors influence pretest probability. Next, I will examine the echocardiogram to see if any findings contradict an ischemic mechanism. After that, I should consider each alternative diagnosis against the history and testing. Finally, I will integrate the evidence into a working diagnosis and note immediate next steps in evaluation and management, aligning with contemporary guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the chest pain phenotype. The description of substernal, pressure-like chest discomfort provoked by walking and relieved within 2–3 minutes of rest fits the classic triad for exertional angina as defined by the 2021 AHA/ACC/ASE Chest Pain Guideline: substernal discomfort, exertional precipitation, and relief with rest or nitroglycerin, with gradual onset and resolution over minutes rather than seconds, which supports myocardial ischemia as the mechanism [^115EMAzi] [^115dUjAM] [^112BpkZP].

> Wait, let me verify risk stratification because pretest probability is pivotal here. In an older man with typical exertional chest discomfort plus hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and long-term smoking, the baseline risk of obstructive coronary artery disease is high, and in this 80-year-old, the age effect further amplifies risk. Women and men at advanced age demonstrate substantially higher rates of significant CAD across symptom categories, which reinforces the likelihood of ischemic etiology in this presentation [^1115iKxy] [^1129dwR9].

> Hold on, I should check the echocardiogram before jumping to conclusions. The report shows mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. LVH itself is not a direct cause of exertional chest pain, but it is a recognized structural consequence of chronic hypertension and a marker of increased CAD risk, and importantly, there is no evidence of aortic stenosis, no resting wall motion abnormality, and no findings that would redirect me toward nonischemic pain generators on echo, so the imaging does not contradict an ischemic mechanism here [^111KyREf].

> I will now examine left ventricular hypertrophy as a potential primary cause. Initially, I wondered if LVH could directly produce exertional chest pressure, but wait, let me verify the pathophysiology. LVH is a compensatory change from chronic afterload (hypertension) and while it increases myocardial oxygen demand and can contribute to ischemia in the setting of supply limitation, it is not itself a pain syndrome, so it cannot explain the classic exertional–rest pattern seen here, making it an unlikely primary etiology of the symptom [^115EMAzi].

> Next, I should review obstructive lung disease as a contender. There is no cough, wheeze, dyspnea, or sputum production reported, spirometry is not provided, and exertional chest pressure is not a classic COPD symptom. Moreover, COPD-related chest discomfort is more often pleuritic or hyperinflation-related rather than a pressure relieved by rest, so this pattern does not fit, though I should acknowledge that COPD prevalence is higher in smokers and that subtle disease could coexist without explaining this specific pain pattern [^notfound].

> Let me consider valvular aortic stenosis carefully. Classic aortic stenosis often presents with exertional chest discomfort, dyspnea, syncope, and a harsh crescendo–decrescendo murmur; however, the echocardiogram explicitly reports no valvular abnormalities, which makes significant aortic stenosis an unlikely cause here, so I should not over-attribute the symptoms to valvular disease in the face of a normal valve assessment [^111KyREf].

> I need to ensure vasospastic angina is not being missed. Prinzmetal or vasospastic angina typically presents with rest-associated chest pain, often at night or early morning, and can be triggered by vasoconstrictors or hyperventilation; it is not classically exertional, and in this patient the clear exertional precipitation with rest relief points away from vasospasm as the primary mechanism, though microvascular dysfunction can coexist in older adults with risk factors and could modify the clinical picture without replacing obstructive epicardial disease as the leading diagnosis [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the absence of dyspnea argues against ischemia; I should double-check that. Dyspnea can accompany ischemia but is not required; many patients, particularly older adults, have ischemia manifest as isolated chest discomfort, and guidelines emphasize that anginal symptoms can present variably across populations, so the lack of dyspnea does not exclude typical angina in this context [^114qMUBR] [^115EMAzi].

> Let me integrate and confirm the diagnosis. The symptom pattern, the patient's age and cardiovascular risk profile, and the absence of competing structural or nonischemic explanations converge on stable coronary artery disease with exertional angina as the most likely diagnosis, which aligns with guideline frameworks classifying this as likely anginal chest discomfort in a high-risk older adult [^112BpkZP] [^115EMAzi].

> Next, I should review the immediate evaluation steps to align with best practice. For a high-risk patient with stable chest pain suggestive of ischemia, noninvasive functional testing is appropriate to confirm ischemia and risk-stratify. Options include stress echocardiography, PET or SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI, with test selection tailored to exercise capacity, resting ECG interpretability, and local expertise, while coronary CTA can be considered in selected patients depending on pretest probability and clinical context [^11336juV] [^114b2Tmm] [^117DnGBq].

> I should confirm risk factor optimization and antithrombotic strategy as part of initial management. Concurrent with test ordering, initiate guideline-directed medical therapy for chronic coronary disease including high-intensity statin, beta-blocker unless contraindicated, ACE inhibitor or ARB for hypertension, and antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin; this is standard foundational therapy while awaiting results of ischemia testing and any decisions regarding revascularization [^notfound].

> Final reasoning: the most likely condition responsible for this patient's exertional, pressure-like chest discomfort relieved by rest is coronary artery disease with stable angina pectoris, driven by flow-limiting epicardial stenoses in the setting of multiple classic risk factors. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a contributing structural marker rather than a primary pain source, and the other listed alternatives are less consistent with the clinical and echocardiographic data [^115EMAzi] [^112BpkZP] [^111KyREf].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **coronary artery disease (CAD)** [^115EMAzi] with stable exertional angina, given the classic exertional chest pressure relieved by rest, multiple cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) [^117C3WFo], and preserved ejection fraction with mild LVH on echocardiography [^notfound]. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a **contributor** but not the primary cause; obstructive lung disease and valvular aortic stenosis are excluded by the absence of dyspnea, cough, or murmur; and vasospastic angina is unlikely due to the exertional pattern and lack of rest or nocturnal symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting coronary artery disease

- **Classic exertional chest pressure**: Substernal, pressure-like, provoked by walking, relieved by rest — typical of stable angina [^115EMAzi] [^112BpkZP].
- **Risk factors**: Age ≥ 75, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 25 pack-year smoking history significantly increase CAD risk [^117C3WFo] [^1115iKxy].
- **Echocardiography**: Mild concentric LVH with preserved EF is common in hypertensive patients and does not exclude CAD; it may reflect chronic ischemia or pressure overload [^notfound].
- **Absence of alternative features**: No dyspnea, cough, murmur, or rest/nocturnal symptoms argue against obstructive lung disease, valvular aortic stenosis, or vasospastic angina [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions

| **Condition** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Left ventricular hypertrophy | Contributes to ischemia but does not independently cause exertional chest pressure; symptoms resolve with rest in angina [^115EMAzi] |
| Obstructive lung disease | No dyspnea, cough, wheeze, or abnormal lung exam; symptoms are not pleuritic or positional [^notfound] |
| Valvular aortic stenosis | No murmur or syncope; echocardiogram shows no valvular abnormalities [^notfound] |
| Vasospastic angina | Symptoms are typically rest/nocturnal and not consistently exertional; no reported vasospastic triggers [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Exercise ECG**: Appropriate initial test for intermediate-to-high risk stable chest pain with interpretable ECG and adequate exercise capacity [^117DnGBq] [^114b2Tmm].
- **Stress imaging**: Stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI if exercise ECG is inconclusive or if higher sensitivity/specificity is needed [^11336juV].
- **Coronary CT angiography**: Consider if noninvasive testing is inconclusive or if anatomic definition is preferred [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's exertional chest pressure relieved by rest, cardiovascular risk profile, and echocardiographic findings **strongly support CAD with stable exertional angina** as the most likely diagnosis [^115EMAzi]. Alternative causes are less likely based on the clinical presentation and available data.

Case report

A 62-year-old woman (height: 155 cm, weight: 80 kg, BMI: 29.8) with a history of typical chest pain was referred to the angiography department for further investigation and angiography after visiting the cardiologist. The patient has a history of hypertension and complains of chest pain that worsens with walking and improves with rest (exertional chest pain, Functional Class I-II). She uses valsartan 160 mg and amlodipine 5 mg tablets to control her hypertension.

The patient was fully conscious with a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg, body temperature of 36.5 °C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15. A basic ECG showed sinus rhythm with no signs of arrhythmia or ischemic changes. An echocardiogram was performed on the patient, and the findings are as follows: normal LV size and systolic function (LV EF = 55%), mild diastolic dysfunction (DDG1), normal RV size and function, no valvular heart disease, and normal SPAP. Although her exertion stress test was negative, she experienced chest pain two- or three-times during exercise despite medical treatment, including bisoprolol 5 mg daily and nitroglycerin 2.6 mg bid. Therefore, angiography was decided. Given the patient's symptom (exertional chest pain), the patient underwent angiography, during which this anomaly was incidentally discovered. To further determine its type, a coronary CT angiography was subsequently performed, which fortunately revealed that it was not of the intraarterial type. Given the non-significant lesions in the coronary arteries (mild CAD) and the presence of hypertension, the patient was started on treatment with statins, ASA, amlodipine, and valsartan.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) evaluation — history, family history, medication review, and examination elements are detailed, including arrhythmia symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, cardiac arrest) and symptoms of underlying heart disease (dyspnea at rest or on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, edema), precipitating factors (exercise, emotional stress), known heart disease (coronary, valvular such as mitral valve prolapse, congenital), and risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking). Medication review encompasses antiarrhythmic and other medications with potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, medications with potential to provoke or aggravate VA, stimulants including cocaine and amphetamines, supplements including anabolic steroids, and medication‑medication interactions that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Family history elements include SCD, SCA, or unexplained drowning in a first-degree relative; SIDS or repetitive spontaneous pregnancy losses; and heart disease with inherited conditions such as cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, dilated, ARVC), congenital heart disease, cardiac channelopathies (Long QT, Brugada, Short QT, CPVT), arrhythmias, and conduction disorders or devices. Physical examination focuses on heart rate and regularity, blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, murmurs, pulses and bruits, edema, and sternotomy scars. The text also notes that obtaining a complete medication history is important, that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and that some medications can also induce Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^1143teWJ]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Typical patterns of symptom presentation in women describe differences in symptom triggers and descriptors compared with men; the most common presentation of myocardial ischemia is chest pain or discomfort; however, women have a different pattern and distribution of non–chest-related pain symptoms, and women's ischemic symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently by physical exertion; proportionately, women more often report epigastric discomfort and associated nausea; radiation of discomfort to the arms, neck, and interscapular areas; and dyspnea and fatigue; studies have not found a pattern of symptoms uniquely ascribed to either sex, but significant overlap in qualitative descriptors exists, and the evidence synthesis highlights that women experience a broad range of symptoms, frequently including recent and stress-related symptoms.

### A rare long-term undetected pheochromocytoma leading to Takotsubo syndrome in an older male patient: a case report [^114Md6W1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 70-year-old Chinese man was admitted to our hospital complaining of a 12-h history of paroxysmal chest distress and chest pain. He had a past medical history of midbrain hemorrhage 6 years ago. He denied a history of hypertension, diabetes, paroxysmal headache, palpitations, or profuse sweating. He denied a history of drug abuse or recent intense emotional stress. His family history was unremarkable. The patient, without obvious inducement, suddenly experienced chest tightness and pain while in bed at 1 a.m. The paroxysmal chest pain lasted about 1 h each time and was accompanied by a feeling of crushing in the precordial region, sweating, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and nausea. Upon admission, a physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 185/122 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min. A pulmonary examination showed diffuse moist rales in the lungs. The initial results of laboratory findings (Table 1) showed elevated white blood cell count, myocardial enzyme, and troponin I levels. The extremely high levels of brain natriuretic peptide and arterial blood gases suggested that the patient might have heart and respiratory failure. Electrocardiography findings suggested sinus tachycardia and mild ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. A pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary edema and a massive lesion in the left adrenal area. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular regional wall (apical wall and mid septal wall) motion abnormalities with an ejection fraction of 34%. The clinical diagnosis was ACS, heart failure, and respiratory failure. The patient was given a venturi mask for oxygen inhalation, morphine for pain relief and vasodilation, furosemide for diuresis, isosorbide nitrate for coronary artery dilation, aspirin combined with clopidogrel for antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation, and atorvastatin for lipid- lowering.

### Extension of interval between adjacent pulse delivery cycles to deal with myocardial ischemia by intravascular lithotripsy: case report [^11294Vye]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 71-year-old male with smoking history was admitted due to recurrent angina. His previous coronary angiography showed stenosis with calcification in the left anterior descending branch (LAD) and thin right coronary artery (Fig. 1). Physical examination indicated no other discomfort. His electrocardiogram demonstrated inverted T waves in limb lead. The post-admission test results were normal. Based on the clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed with unstable angina. The therapeutic regimen included antiplatelet agents, coronary vasodilators and lipid-lowering agents. One day later, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) confirmed the diffuse lesion from the LAD ostium to the middle section (minimum lumen area: 2.24mm 2, plaque load: 80% and a grade-IV calcification in the Fig. 2). Two Lacrosse non-slip element balloons (3.0/3.5 mm*10 mm) failed to predilate the lesion. A 4.0 mm*12 mm shockwave balloon was progressed with 8 cycles. IVL not only induced ventricular premature beats, but also caused chest pain symptoms and transient ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram (Additional file 1). After balloon deflation, there was nothing. The operator extended the interval between the pulse delivery of adjacent cycles to 20s. The patient still had chest pain and transient ST-segment depression. The duration of a single ST-segment depression was between 11 and 13s. For the above conditions, the operator extended the interval to 30s and the chest pain symptoms or ST-segment changes disappeared (Fig. 3). Subsequently, calcification ruptures were seen in the IVUS (Fig. 2 a-b). After implantation of a stent in mid-LAD, a drug balloon was performed in the proximal of LAD (Fig. 2 c), and final angiography and IVUS displayed good results. The results of the postoperative test were normal. Electrocardiogram showed no significant change compared to preoperation after operation. A telephone follow-up six months later indicated the patient had no discomfort.

Methods

Study Design

This single-center prospective cohort study was granted ethical approval by the South Yorkshire & Humber NHS Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority (21/YH/0231). Participants provided written informed consent and underwent investigations between January 2022 and September 2022 at the University of Leeds, Advanced Imaging Center, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, United Kingdom. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Participant Recruitment

Participants were recruited from sporting clubs/organizations within the United Kingdom via email invitation to their respective club/organization.

Inclusion Criteria

Male cyclists/triathletes aged ≥ 50 years old undertaking ≥ 10 hours of exercise per week for ≥ 15 years and regularly competing at local, national, or international level.

Exclusion CVD Criteria

Preexisting coronary artery disease (including CVD, tachyarrhythmia, and arterial hypertension), significant medical condition (mild hyperlipidemia defined as requiring the use of a single lipid-lowering medication and without a known inherited lipid disorder, and mild asthma were not considered significant), or contraindication to CMR. Athletes were excluded if they had any cardiac symptoms suggestive of underlying CVD (anginal chest pain, palpitations, exertional dyspnea, and syncope). One hundred and thirty-nine potential participants were screened, of whom 106 were recruited to the study. Reasons for exclusion consisted of not meeting age requirements (n = 6) and prior CVD (n = 27).

A comparative group of age-matched male nonathletic controls were also recruited to undergo an identical CMR protocol to identify whether the observed prevalence of myocardial fibrosis was specific to athletes. Inclusion criteria: aged ≥ 50 years (identical to the athlete cohort) and participation in formal exercise of < 3 h/wk. Exclusion criteria: known CVD, symptoms suggestive of CVD, and any regular medications.

Baseline Assessment

Participants underwent physical examination, which included measurement of resting blood pressure and heart rate (HR). A self-reported full medical, sporting, and lifestyle history was documented, and cardiovascular risk factors were recorded, including any prior history of hyperlipidemia and family history of CVD including cardiomyopathy and SCD. Social histories were taken, consisting of smoking status, alcohol and caffeine intake along with any use of performance-enhancing drugs.

All participants underwent blood sampling for full blood count, renal profile, lipid profile, and hemoglobin A1c, and resting 12-lead ECG (MAC500; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI).

### Ischaemic heart disease masquerading as headache: a case series [^113Q4Vr6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Case Presentation

Our first patient is a 60‐year‐old male who has no past medical history and takes no regular medications. He presented to the emergency department (ED) due to progressively worsening headaches over the preceding 3 h. It was mainly on top of the head and without radiation. There were no other neurological symptoms. Vital signs and physical assessment, including neurological examination, were normal. Routine blood results were normal. Whilst in ED, he started having diaphoresis and central chest tightness. A 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated inferior ST elevation (Figure 1). The interventional cardiology consultant on call discussed this with the patient and advised arranging an urgent computed tomography (CT) of the head and an aortogram. This was done to rule out intracranial haemorrhage and aortic dissection. By now, the chest tightness had settled, but the patient continued to have headaches with no resolution of the elevated ST segments. The patient was, therefore, taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and underwent emergency coronary angiography, demonstrating an acutely occluded obtuse marginal artery, which was successfully stented (Figure 2). There was rapid and full resolution of the headache post‐stenting. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home 48 h later without further headaches.

Previously, from our institution, we have presented the case of a younger gentleman in his forties who had presented with severe exertional headaches with mild chest discomfort, which was relieved with rest. These symptoms were triggered solely by exercise. The patient was found to have hyperlipidaemia, and all neurological causes for headache were excluded. He had a non‐diagnostic exercise tolerance test followed by coronary angiography that revealed a CTO of the LAD. The latter was successfully treated with a drug‐eluting stent. Following the procedure, the patient remained free of headache symptoms until 2 years later, when he presented again with ACS. Presenting symptoms were predominantly of headache, and this was similar in character to his previous presentation. He was found to have severe disease in a different coronary artery and underwent a successful angioplasty to his left circumflex artery.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115EMAzi]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

Table 1
Characteristics of patients

Case-1 The patient was was an elderly male with a 35-year history of smoking. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. Sixteen years ago, he was diagnosed with squamous-cell carcinoma of the left lung and subsequently underwent a left pneumonectomy, without receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy afterward. Nearly 8 years post-surgery, he experienced recurrent fever. Upon confirming that the left empyema was not associated with BPF, he was treated with chest tube drainage, which yielded approximately 100 mL of fluid per day. The primary admission symptoms included paroxysmal cough, yellow sputum, and blood-tinged sputum.

Case-2 The patient was a 65-year-old male with a 20-year history of smoking and an 8-year history of hypertension. He was regularly prescribed amlodipine besylate at a dosage of 5 mg once daily. The patient had no medical history of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes. After being diagnosed with left lung squamous-cell carcinoma, he had a left pneumonectomy 7 months ago. A review of the medical history data from other hospital indicated that preoperative contrast-enhanced chest CT did not reveal any significant enhancement of lymph nodes around the bronchus. Additionally, no notable calcification was observed around the bronchial stump during the initial operation, and the bronchial stump was not pre-embedded following the pneumonectomy. Four months post-operation, he developed empyema with BPF, necessitating chest tube drainage. Upon admission, the main symptoms reported were chest tightness and fatigue following physical exertion.

Definitions for Table 1.1 — symptom categories for chest discomfort are specified. Likely anginal symptoms include chest/epigastric/shoulder/arm/jaw pain or chest pressure/discomfort with exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest, nitroglycerin, or both. Less-likely anginal symptoms include dyspnea or fatigue when not exertional and not relieved by rest/nitroglycerin, as well as generalized fatigue or chest discomfort with a time course not suggestive of angina. A noncardiac explanation is present when an alternative diagnosis such as gastroesophageal reflux, chest trauma, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pleurisy is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

### Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies in the cardiology emergency department: epidemiology, patient profile, and management [^112KaE5p]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive urgencies (HU) and hypertensive emergencies (HE) are common conditions in the cardiology emergency department (ED), often requiring urgent intervention. Despite their clinical significance, data on patient characteristics, etiologies, and management strategies remain limited. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology, clinical profile, and management of HU and HE in a tertiary cardiology ED. A single-center, observational study was conducted over 12 months, enrolling patients diagnosed with HU/HE (BP ≥ 180/120mmHg). Demographic data, medical history, symptoms, etiologic factors, and antihypertensive treatments were recorded. Serial blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken to assess BP reduction during the ED stay. Of 4010 cardiology ED visits, 83 patients (2.1%) had HU/HE (median age 65 years, 45.8% male). Most had a history of hypertension (73.5%), with frequent coexisting smoking (56.6%) and dyslipidemia (43.4%). Common symptoms included dyspnea (19.3%) and chest pain (25.3%). Stress (26.8%) and increased salt intake (15.9%) were common etiologic factors. HE was diagnosed in 18 cases (21.7%), and 12.7% of HU cases required hospitalization. Mean BP on admission was 200/100mmHg, with SBP and DBP reductions of 41mmHg (-21%) and 18mmHg (-17%), respectively. Nitrates, anxiolytics, and combination therapies resulted in the greatest BP reductions. In conclusion, HU and HE are frequently observed in hypertensive patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors. Target-organ damage is not solely related to BP levels, emphasizing the need for individualized management strategies.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

Definition of Risk Factors

There was 2‐way verification of risk factors and symptoms. First, based on a survey questionnaire filled in the CT laboratory. Second, with verification using electronic health care records comprising physician diagnosis in clinic and laboratory results. Both former and current smokers constituted a positive smoking history. Family history of premature CAD was considered positive if this was known in a first‐degree male relative of age < 55 years or a first‐degree female relative of age < 65 years. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total serum cholesterol of > 5.5 mmol/L or if the patient was on statin therapy. Patients were considered diabetic if they had any one of the following: (1) fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), (2) glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%, (3) an extant physician diagnosis, or (4) were on diabetic medication. Patients were considered hypertensive if they had any one of the following: (1) systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, (2) diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, (3) an extant physician diagnosis, or (4) were on antihypertensive medication. Chest pain symptoms were defined as typical, atypical, or nonanginal. Typical chest pain was defined as (1) substernal chest pain or discomfort; that was (2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress; and (3) relieved by rest or nitrate. Atypical chest pain was defined as 2 of the previously mentioned criteria. If 1 or none of the criteria was present, chest pain was categorized as nonanginal. Dyspnea on exertion was considered as equivalent to typical chest pain.

Operational definitions

Patients were diagnosed with hypertension if they had a 'persistent rise in SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg for at least two occasions, or if they were using antihypertensive medication or had a history of hypertension'. Patients were diagnosed with diabetes if they had a 'history of diabetes or used antidiabetic medications, or if their fasting plasma glucose was ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2 hours after fasting plasma glucose was ≥ 200 mg/dL, or if their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was ≥ 6.5%, or if they exhibited classic symptoms of hyperglycaemic or hyperglycaemic crisis, and their random plasma glucose was ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L)'. Dyslipidaemia was diagnosed if the patient had 'total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol above 130 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol below 40 mg/dL (> 1.0 mmol/L) in males and 50 mg/dL (> 1.3 mmol/L) in women, triglycerides above 150 mg/dL (> 1.7 mmol/L), or was taking lipid-lowering therapy'. Unstable angina is chest discomfort or pain resulting from inadequate blood and oxygen supply to the heart. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is diagnosed in patients with acute coronary syndrome-like symptoms and elevated troponin levels, but no STEMI-like ECG abnormalities.STEMI is clinically diagnosed when there is new (or increased) and sustained ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads of > 1 mm in all leads, excluding leads V2–V3 for which the following cut-off points apply. Current smoker, smoking cigarettes within 1 month of this admission; recent smoker, quit between 1 month and 1 year before this admission; past smoker, quit greater than 1 year before this admission; non-smoker, never smoked cigarettes.

### A case of plateau heart disease misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary heart disease [^117XjxSD]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

General information

A 49-year-old male patient developed chest tightness and shortness of breath six years ago, which became worse after activity, and coughed up a small amount of white foamy sputum intermittently. However, the patient had no obvious chest pain or precordial pain. The patient was diagnosed as chronic pulmonary heart disease in several hospitals and received irregular oxygen therapy at home and Lung Tonic Pill (a Chinese patent medicine for lung diseases) and other drugs. One month ago, the patient experienced right-sided chest pain after activity, which was intermittent and dull and accompanied by general fatigue, chest tightness and shortness of breath. As the symptoms did not improve after taking theophylline delayed-release tablets and buckwheat capsules, the patient was referred to Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital. The patient had a history of hypertension for 6 years with the highest blood pressure being 190/130 mmHg. The long-term oral administration of "felodipine extended-release tablets 5 mg" produced no satisfactory control of blood pressure. The blood pressure at the time of admission was 158/91 mmHg, which remains above the normal range of 120/80 mmHg. His eyelids and conjunctiva were congested, and his lips were mildly cyanotic. Cyanosis of the extremities, clubbing of the fingers (Figs. 1 and 2). The thorax was symmetrical and both lungs were normal on palpation, percussion was clear, lungs showed coarse respiratory sounds with no obvious dry or wet rales or pleural friction sounds. The heart boundary was not large and a pronounced second heart sound can be detected in the area where the pulmonary valve is auscultated. No pathological murmur was heard in each valve auscultation area, and no edema was observed in in either lower limb. The examination in 2020 showed that the hemoglobin level was 201 g/l and the lung function was normal, but no other information was provided. The medical history revealed that the patient was born in Hu zhu County (> 2500 m a.s.l), Qinghai Province, China, and lived there for a long period of time, but he had travelled to and from Chaka Salt Farms (3059 m a.s.l) many times in his youth over a period of 10 years. The patient complained of chest tightness, shortness of breath and cyanosis once at high altitude, which were relieved by oxygen inhalation. The patient has a 15-year smoking history (15 cigarettes a day) and quit smoking 6 years ago.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116A5a9L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Many researchers have reported that upper back pain and fatigue are commonly reported symptoms during ACS, and up to 30% of patients do not experience chest pain. 19, 20 This information is important to consider as we try to differentiate patients who will be ruled in compared with those ruled out for ACS. We found that although chest pain is a sensitive symptom for ACS, it is not very specific (Table). 1 In fact, few other symptoms were sensitive or specific for a diagnosis of ACS. In our multicenter prospective study, we found few symptom differences between patients with and without ACS presenting to the ED. 13 Ferry et al 8 defined chest pain as all descriptors of chest symptoms, including pressure or discomfort. Their rationale was that terms other than pain are "functions of sex‐related language rather than symptom differences in symptom presentation". This is an opinion that is counterproductive to science and accurate assessment of symptoms, which are, by definition, subjective and what the patient says they are.

Table 1
Sensitivity and Specificity of Symptoms for ACS by Sex 1

We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results such as those of Ferry et al, 8 that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for ACS.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Methods

Population

Participants were recruited from the database PATS (Patient Analysis & Tracking System; Dendrite Clinical Systems), which covers eastern Denmark with ≈3 million inhabitants. All women (18–80 years) referred between March 2012 and September 2014 for a clinically indicated diagnostic CAG due to angina‐like chest pain and suspected obstructive CAD were screened according to previously described well‐defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). 10 We included both women referred for stable angina and women hospitalized suspected of unstable angina, since the latter may be first manifestation of stable angina. Women with elevated cardiac markers or ST‐segment elevation were excluded (Figure 1). All women were included within 1 year of their CAG.

Figure 1
Inclusion and exclusion criteria in thestudy.

Basic Examination

Basic assessment included clinical and demographic data. Trained health professionals interviewed participants regarding cardiac symptoms with respect to location, character, duration, radiation, frequency, and provoking and alleviating factors. According to the classical classification of chest pain symptoms were classified as typical angina pectoris, atypical angina pectoris and non‐cardiac chest pain. 11, 12 Questionnaires regarding chest pain symptoms included the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, which evaluates 5 dimensions of functional status, 13 and the World Health Organization's Rose's Angina Questionnaire, which evaluates symptoms as definite angina or not, further subdividing those with definite angina as severe or nonsevere. 14

We obtained information regarding cardiovascular risk factors (age, body mass index [BMI], diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease, and menopausal status), comorbidity, previous hospital admissions, and previous diagnostic tests, which included noninvasive cardiac computed tomography–angiography (CTA), exercise electrocardiography (ECG), and single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed within 6 months before CAG from interviews and charts. ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate measures were obtained at rest, and abdominal circumference was measured. The ECG was analyzed for signs of ischemia (inverted T wave, pathological Q wave, ST‐segment depression), bundle‐branch block, and atrial fibrillation. Blood samples were analyzed for cholesterol levels (total, low‐density lipoprotein [LDL], and high‐density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), triglycerides, creatinine level, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c). A spot urine sample was analyzed for microalbuminuria.

A 52-year-old white woman presented with severe pain over the right upper abdomen and nonpleuritic, right-sided, lower chest-wall pain. Her pain had progressively gotten more frequent and severe over the last 5 months. It was also associated with a nonexertional, pressure-like sensation in the central chest. The patient denied any shortness of breath, fevers, cough, or any sputum production. She was taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and was a 30-pack-year current smoker; there was no history of drug abuse or occupational exposure. Previous chest radiographs dating back to 5 years consistently showed an elevated right-sided hemidiaphragm without any infiltrates or effusions; cardiomediastinal structures were unremarkable. She had not had a previous workup for these abnormal findings.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Eletriptan hydrobromide [^117X7yz5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with eletriptan hydrobromide and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. Eletriptan hydrobromide tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. Eletriptan hydrobromide tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions

Eletriptan hydrobromide may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional eletriptan hydrobromide doses [see Contraindications (4)].

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused acute migraine drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

Six months prior, she noted a worsening of her symptoms, with progressive physical activity limitation caused by exertional fatigue and dyspnea (climbing 2 to 3 flights of stairs). She also experienced palpitations, with an estimated heart rate that ranged from 120 to 150 beats per minute. The patient denied chest pain, hemoptysis, or other notable symptoms. Notably, the patient underwent surgical repair of an atrial septal defect more than 20 years earlier, with a good postoperative recovery. Regular postoperative echocardiograms revealed no residual shunt, no valvular abnormalities, and no pulmonary hypertension. The patient had no history of smoking, drug abuse, or alcohol consumption.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^113SsAv4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

Tobacco use assessment and clinician advice — wording and impact: Patients who answer yes to screening questions such as "Have you used any other tobacco product in the past 30 days?" are considered current smokers, and clinicians should avoid asking "Are you a smoker?" or "Do you smoke?" because people are less likely to report tobacco use when asked in this way; tobacco users are more likely to quit after 6 months when clinicians strongly advise adults to quit using tobacco than when clinicians give no advice or usual care.

### A surprising cause of masses in the chest [^11282daR]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old male presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of chest pain and mild shortness of breath at rest. The pain in his left lower chest was pleuritic with intensity 9- on a 10-point scale. He had driven 2 h in his car that day, but had no other prolonged immobility. About 15 years previously, he was found to have increased hemoglobin (18.1 g/dL) and diagnosed with secondary erythrocytosis due to active smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and residence in Payson, Arizona (altitude 4,999 ft). Polycythemia vera was entertained, but not pursued due to multiple secondary risks. He had been treated with daily aspirin and monthly phlebotomies to maintain a hematocrit below 45%. He also had a history of superficial thrombophlebitis, nephrolithiasis, hypertension and superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder resected and in remission. There was also a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) 13 years previously, believed to be provoked by prolonged immobility after a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer now in remission. His medications were aspirin and lisinopril; he had no known drug allergies. He quit smoking 2 years prior after a 70 pack-year history. There was no other family history of thrombosis or bleeding disorder, autoimmune disorders, pulmonary disease or malignancy.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

He presented with a 6-month history of twice weekly central chest pain lasting 2–3min with walking and exertion, relieved with rest or co-codamol tablets. After initial investigations and a positive myoview scan, he was listed for an elective coronary angiogram. Unfortunately, the procedure was abandoned due to unclear course of the guide wire and a possible aberrant aortic course. Further non-invasive tests were arranged to clarify the anatomy of the vessels. After getting a clear idea of the aberrancies, coronary angiogram was replanned, and the patient underwent successful angiography with angioplasty to one of the coronary arteries, without any complications.

### Pooled individual patient data from five countries were used to derive a clinical prediction rule for coronary artery disease in primary care [^112vAZsT]. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule for chest pain in primary care" for chest pain, coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule is a diagnostic tool used in primary care settings to evaluate patients presenting with chest pain. The name "INTERCHEST" is an abbreviation derived from the study "International Chest pain prediction rule" which developed this tool.

This calculator is specifically designed for adult patients who present to primary care with chest pain. Its primary clinical utility is to help clinicians estimate the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) in these patients. By considering various patient characteristics and symptoms, the INTERCHEST rule provides a score that can predict the likelihood of CAD, thereby aiding in decision-making about further diagnostic testing and management.

The INTERCHEST rule should not be used in patients with known CAD, those with a clear alternative diagnosis for their chest pain, or those with chest pain due to trauma. It is also not intended for use in emergency settings, where more acute causes of chest pain (such as myocardial infarction) need to be ruled out.

The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule is a tool designed to evaluate the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who present with chest pain in a primary care scenario. This assessment is achieved by reviewing a set of six distinct factors, each asking for a simple yes or no answer, which ultimately calculates a score indicating the likelihood of CAD.

These are the factors considered in the INTERCHEST rule:

- Is the patient male and aged 55 years or older, or female and aged 65 years or older?
- Does the patient have a history of coronary artery disease?
- Did the physician initially suspect a serious condition based on the patient's presentation?
- Does the chest discomfort feel like pressure to the patient?
- Is the chest pain related to physical effort or exertion?
- Can the pain be reproduced when the physician applies physical palpation?

Each affirmative answer to these questions adds one point to the total score, while a negative answer adds no points. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 6.

The interpretation of the INTERCHEST score helps guide clinical decision-making:

- A score of 1 or below indicates a low risk of coronary artery disease. This is related to an estimated CAD prevalence of about 2.1%.
- A score of 2 or above suggests a high risk, implying an estimated CAD prevalence of 43.0%.

This scoring system helps healthcare providers stratify risk and decide further management steps for patients with chest pain, ensuring that those who might need more intensive investigation or immediate intervention are identified promptly.

### Vertebral compression fractures-the first manifestations in the elderly acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111bFJuf]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old man was admitted with a 1-month history of progressive chest and back pain and worsening pain after heavy lifting. The pain had no obvious cause. It became painful when standing or walking, and relieved after bed rest. At that time, the thoracolumbar spine X-rays showed obvious spinal degenerative changes which was not match his age. Combined with the clinical symptoms of chest and back pain, the bone density examination was performed to diagnosis furtherly. Bone density examination showed osteoporosis. Then the anti-osteoporosis treatment was given. 3 days later, the patient felt that the symptoms of chest and back pain were significantly aggravated after lifting a heavy object, and the pain was not obviously relieved after resting. So he sought medical attention again. Physical examination revealed widespread pressure and percussion pain in chest and back. X-ray of the thoracic spine showed mild vertebral compression of T5 and T6 (Figure 1A). Further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high probability of compression fractures of vertebrae from T5 to T8, T10 and T12 (Figure 1B). Inpatient diagnosis: 1. Multiple spinal compression fractures (T5-T8, T10, and T12); 2. Severe osteoporosis; 3. Hypertension (5-years prior history of hypertension). No abnormalities were found in routine blood examination, liver and kidney function tests after hospitalization. In order to further clarify the responsible segment, bone scans were given to show that increased radioactive uptake in multiple vertebrae of the thoracolumbar spine, especially for T4, T6, T8, T10, T11 and T12 (Figure 1C). Compared with other vertebrae, there was higher accumulation of radioactivity in T6 and T8. At the same time, careful physical examination showed that pressing pain and percussion pain were the most obvious accordingly. Then the T6 and T8 vertebrae were analyzed as fresh fracture and symptom responsibility segment to perform vertebroplasty under local anesthesia and sedation (Figure 2A and B). Intraoperative pathology specimens were sent. And the results demonstrated: the peripheral myeloproliferative hyperplasia was extremely active; adipocytes disappeared; rare erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, myeloblasts and promyelocytes mainly in the proliferative cells, scattered immature eosinophils in the foci. Myeloid sarcoma was considered. The further result of bone marrow biopsy was showed in Figure 3A. Bone marrow hyperplasia was extremely active; 77.5% of the cells were archaeocytes; guanulocytosis was suppressed; 13% of the cells were erythroid cells; 2.5% of the cells were lymphocytes; 299 megakaryocytes were visible in the whole film. Immunophenotype by flow cytometry with CD45 gating: CD45 weakly positive cells accounted for 69.2% of all karyocytes; abnormal cellular antigen expression was dominated by lymphoid differentiation antigen; cCD79 88.9%, CD19 95.9%, CD10 85.6%, CD33 79.5%, CD15 22.3%, CD34 96.8%, HLA-DR 96%, TdT 75.8%. The result of immunohistochemistry (Figure 3B) was negative. Final diagnosis was given as 1) B-ALL with myelocytic antigens; 2) B-ALL with multiple bone metastasis. Finally, the patient was transferred to the hematology department for standardized chemotherapy treatment. After regular chemotherapy, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. The patient unfortunately passed away in March 2019 from heart failure and lung infection due to atrial fibrillation.

### Interventricular septal dissection secondary to acute inferior myocardial infarction: case series and literature review [^115Zesuz]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Interventricular septal dissection is a critical disease characterized by the separation of the intraventricular septum into two layers, forming an intermediate layer with a cystic cavity that communicates with the root of the aorta or ventricle. It has low morbidity and high mortality rates.

Case Presentation

Case 1: A 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and smoking presented to a local hospital due to chest tightness and pain for 4 days. Coronary angiography revealed diffuse lesions from the proximal to the middle segment of the left circumflex branch, with 80% stenosis at its most severe point, and complete occlusion of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery. A stent was implanted in the middle of the right coronary artery. Three months later, the patient was misdiagnosed with an aneurysm of the membranous ventricular septum with defect via echocardiography at the local hospital. After the implantation of a stent in the left circumflex branch, the patient came to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The first ultrasound of our hospital misdiagnosed it as ventricular septal rupture, and a senior ultrasound doctor diagnosed the patient with interventricular septal dissection secondary to myocardial infarction. The patient underwent follow-up echocardiography every 1–2 months for 6 months. The patient remains asymptomatic with stable hemodynamics. The original treatment regimen and follow-up continues. Case 2: A 70-year-old male was admitted to a local hospital due to repeated chest distress for more than 20 years that worsened over several hours. Coronary angiography revealed complete occlusion of the right coronary artery. Cardiogenic shock occurred after percutaneous coronary intervention. The initial several echocardiography of the local hospital and our hospital misdiagnosed it as interventricular septal rupture secondary to myocardial infarction. The later echocardiography diagnosed it as interventricular septal dissection with rupture secondary to myocardial infarction. The patient underwent interventricular septal repair and mitral valvuloplasty after 25 days of medical treatment and died of multiple organ failure on the fourth day after the operation.

Conclusions

These two cases illustrate a complication of acute myocardial infarction and highlight the importance of echocardiography in its diagnosis. By exploring the etiology, pathogenesis, and key diagnostic points of IVSD, this study aims to provide valuable insights for clinical practice.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1136KvSZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Orthopnea secondary to brachial plexitis with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [^114LwGmJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 50-year-old male patient presented to the clinic complaining of shortness of breath for three months duration that started insidiously. It occurred only in a supine position, with the patient specifying: "I can't lay flat for a second". He has been having difficulties sleeping despite propping up two to three pillows. There was no dyspnea at rest, the patient could exercise three times a week without limitation, and there were no episodes of nocturnal dyspnea. There was no cough, postnasal drip, reflux symptoms, or chest pain. There was no recent upper respiratory illness, but the patient reported intermittent episodes of severe neck and left shoulder pain for the past three months that occurred without apparent trauma and did not improve with positional changes, muscle relaxants, and over-the-counter pain relievers. This pain had worsened gradually over time. There was no associated left upper extremity numbness, weakness, or atrophic changes. Family history was unknown because the patient was adopted. Past medical history was remarkable for primary hypertension and obesity class I with a body mass index of 32 and no surgery or trauma. The patient was a former smoker (8 pack-year) who quit… years ago.

The patient appeared well on examination, with a pulse of 85 beats/min, blood pressure of 179/105 mm Hg, temperature of 36.6 °C, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. The patient had good bilateral breathing sounds without wheeze, rhonchi or, or crackle in a seated position. There was good expansion of the chest wall. The patient did not tolerate lying flat, immediately gasping for air, and sitting back up immediately. Abdomen was nondistended. There was mild bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities. There was no limitation of motion or tenderness with passive and active neck and left shoulder movement. Peripheral pulses were all present and symmetrical. Neurological examination was normal that included motor, sensory, cranial nerves, coordination, and gait testing. Further neurological examination of the bilateral upper extremities revealed normal deep tendon reflexes with the absence of spasticity and weakness. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.

### A 52-year-old man with palpitations and a solitary pulmonary nodule [^115R3tRo]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old white man presented to a pulmonary clinic for evaluation of a 2.3×1.7 cm lung nodule. The patient had originally presented to his cardiologist for palpitations. The palpitations were described as a "fluttering" sensation, occurring daily, more often at rest, but not associated with syncope. At the time, he denied dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea. The patient had a coronary artery calcium scoring test done, which revealed a lobulated, well-circumscribed, smoothly marginated lower lobe nodule, and he was sent to a pulmonary clinic for further evaluation. The patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis. He denied fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. He had a 1 pack-year smoking history and stopped cigarettes 30 years ago but still smoked two to three cigars monthly. His family history was only significant for early coronary artery disease. He was an avid marathon runner who worked as an athletic equipment manager for a prominent sports team in Arizona.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to suspect ACS in > 75 years old patients presenting with chest pain and accompanying symptoms, such as shortness of breath, syncope or acute delirium, or when an unexplained fall has occurred.

Considerations for older patients with chest pain — COR 1 (LOE C-LD) specifies that in patients with chest pain who are ≥ 75 years of age, ACS should be considered when accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, syncope, or acute delirium are present, or when an unexplained fall has occurred. Increased age is a significant risk factor for ACS, and although patients > 75 years of age account for 33% of all cases of ACS, alternative diagnoses are still more common than a cardiac cause of chest pain at presentation. A substudy of the PROMISE trial has shown that patients ≥ 75 years of age with stable symptoms suggestive of CAD are more likely to have a positive noninvasive test and more coronary artery calcification than younger people, and for these older patients, when compared with anatomic noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD with cardiac CT, a positive stress test result was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death or MI. Patients > 75 years of age may have symptoms of shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or experienced an unexplained fall, and the physician should have a heightened awareness to understand that these symptoms may be associated with ACS, in addition to chest pain.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### A 38-year-old man with a 2-month history of fever, cough, palpitations, and Weight loss [^1145U2zp]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old man of Indian origin, who migrated to Greece 13 years prior to presentation, was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of nonprogressive, intermittent (mostly evening), low-grade (up to 38.5°C) fever, accompanied by night sweats, dry cough, mild dyspnea on exertion (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale grade 1), anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss of 10 kg. He also experienced continuous palpitations, which were regular, not associated with chest pain or dizziness, and aggravated on exertion. He had not taken any medication for his condition, except for antipyretic agents, nor had he sought medical advice. He was a nonsmoker, had a history of past alcohol dependence, and had been hospitalized twice for acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia. He had also been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, presumably poorly controlled because he mentioned not taking any medication or having regular follow-up.
