## Question

Mucoid cyst being mistaken for abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how mucoid cysts are mistaken for abscesses and how to differentiate and manage them effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pathophysiologic distinction between mucoid cysts and abscesses. Then, I should identify scenarios and anatomic locations where misdiagnosis commonly occurs. Next, I will review imaging pitfalls and clinical discriminators. After that, I need to confirm the role of histopathology as the diagnostic standard. Finally, I will synthesize management implications and propose a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm, double-checking each assertion against the cited literature as I go [^116SVLps] [^113YkcUS].

> Let me first confirm the definitions to ground the rest of the analysis. Mucoid cysts are benign, non-neoplastic, mucus-secreting epithelial-lined or ganglion-type cystic lesions with mucin/glycosaminoglycan-rich contents and no primary bacterial infection, whereas abscesses are collections of purulent material with neutrophils, necrosis, and viable bacteria representing active infection, so the infection/no-infection axis is the key early discriminator, although secondary infection can blur this boundary and mimic abscess clinically and radiographically [^116SVLps] [^1118dmXu] [^113YkcUS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — because mucoid cysts can become secondarily infected, a binary "sterile vs infected" framework can fail at the bedside, and I should keep that caveat in mind as I proceed [^115Q9K1s].

> Next, I should review when misdiagnosis typically happens, and I need to check that I'm not overgeneralizing from rare settings. The first scenario is secondary infection of a pre-existing mucoid cyst, producing a mucopyocele that behaves like an abscess; this is particularly emphasized in cystic fibrosis, where sinonasal mucoceles are more likely to be infected than in otherwise healthy hosts, and the clinical picture then tracks with suppurative disease rather than a sterile cystic process [^113GagZY]. The second scenario is atypical anatomic location, where diagnostic anchoring favors "abscess" (for example, retrorectal cysts repeatedly miscalled perianal abscesses, leading to inappropriate procedures) [^112mYzUt]. The third scenario is inflammatory change overshadowing the cystic nature, as seen with infected thyroglossal duct cysts that become painful, rapidly enlarging, rim-enhancing lesions with surrounding soft tissue inflammation and even frank abscess formation, making them radiologically and clinically resemble a primary abscess [^114HCCyD]. Wait, let me verify that this is not an exhaustive list; indeed, these are recurring themes rather than a single pathway to error [^115Q9K1s].

> I will now examine anatomic locations where the risk of confusion is documented, but wait, I should verify that these are supported by series rather than only isolated cases. In the hand, digital mucoid cysts are typically sterile but series document occasional infections managed with antibiotics and/or debridement, which can present like an "abscess of the finger" at first glance [^116SVLps]. In the head and neck, developmental cysts (branchial cleft, thyroglossal duct) and mucoceles can become infected and mimic abscesses clinically and on imaging, while malignant cystic nodes can also suppurate and masquerade as abscesses, expanding the differential and the potential for missteps in acute care settings [^115Q9K1s] [^114HCCyD]. In the presacral/retrorectal space, cysts are frequently misdiagnosed as perianal abscesses or fistulae until careful exam and cross-sectional imaging redirect management to definitive resection and histology [^112mYzUt]. In the vulva, distinguishing Bartholin duct cysts from true gland abscesses drives office-based management choices and antibiotic use; mislabeling influences recurrence and the appropriateness of procedures like Word catheter placement versus marsupialization or incision/drainage, so I need to ensure I'm applying the correct category before intervening [^113YkcUS] [^11365H2N].

> Now, let me consider imaging pitfalls, because I initially thought advanced imaging would reliably separate these, but wait, I should double-check the evidence that imaging alone is often insufficient. On ultrasound, both infected cysts and abscesses can appear hypoechoic with debris and posterior enhancement, and features like a thick wall or internal echoes are not specific, particularly when a sterile cyst has become secondarily inflamed or infected [^115GLgmE]. On CT, wall thickening and perilesional fat stranding are seen in infected cysts and in abscesses, limiting specificity; in presacral disease, CT in combination with careful physical examination improved diagnostic accuracy but CT alone was not definitive, underscoring the need for clinical correlation [^112mYzUt] [^115GLgmE]. On MRI, diffusion restriction, fluid-fluid levels, and rind enhancement can be shared across infected cysts and abscesses, while mucoid degeneration elsewhere (for example, ACL) produces thickening and increased signal that can be misconstrued as inflammation; more broadly, even in a well-studied domain like pancreatic cysts, MRCP accuracy for cyst type is only 40–50%, reminding me not to overtrust morphologic imaging alone when categorizing cystic lesions [^116iCrHF] [^116Dhx4f] [^115GLgmE]. Hold on, I should verify that diffusion and PET can help in selected hepatic cyst infections; yes, EASL notes DWI hyperintensity, wall thickening, gas, and FDG lining uptake as clues to infection, but specificity remains context-dependent and still requires integration with clinical and lab data [^115GLgmE].

> I need to check whether there are consistent clinical discriminators that hold up when the presentation is ambiguous. Chronicity and indolent growth without systemic toxicity favor a mucoid cyst, while acutely painful, rapidly enlarging, erythematous, fluctuant lesions with fever and elevated inflammatory markers support abscess, but wait, once a mucoid cyst is secondarily infected, it can present with tenderness, rim enhancement, and surrounding cellulitis, eroding the heuristic value of these features alone [^114HCCyD]. I should confirm that laboratory data contribute; leukocytosis and elevated CRP/ESR reinforce an infectious diagnosis, whereas normal markers lean toward a sterile cyst, though immunocompromised states can blunt these signals, necessitating cautious interpretation alongside imaging and clinical course [^115Q9K1s]. When intra-abdominal sepsis is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT is appropriate to evaluate for abscess and alternative etiologies, but imaging must be read in light of the possibility of cystic mimics and the need for source control when abscess is confirmed [^1174tgeC].

> Given these overlaps, I should confirm the diagnostic standard and how to reach it practically. Histopathology remains the gold standard: mucoid or ganglion-type cysts show a fibrous wall with mucin and no true epithelial lining in ganglia or a respiratory-type lining in mucoceles, typically without neutrophilic suppuration unless secondarily infected, whereas abscesses show purulent material, abundant neutrophils, central necrosis, and often organisms, correlating with imaging signs such as pus layering on ADC maps in neck infections [^112Xp6XH] [^115Q9K1s]. Wait, I almost said cytology alone suffices, but I should verify that clinicoradiologic-pathologic correlation is emphasized for mucinous lesions in other organs too, as management hinges on precise categorization; indeed, pathology frameworks stress integrated diagnosis to avoid under- or overtreatment across mucinous entities [^115uRt7v] [^113gF8Qn]. In retrorectal cysts, definitive surgical excision both treats the lesion and provides the tissue diagnosis after a string of misdirected procedures, reinforcing why earlier suspicion and planned resection are preferable to repeated drainage attempts [^112mYzUt].

> I should now assess the management stakes of getting this wrong, and I need to ensure I capture both directions of error. If a mucoid cyst is mistaken for an abscess, patients may receive unnecessary antibiotics, undergo simple drainage or aspiration with high recurrence, and experience delay to definitive excision; for example, in Bartholin pathology, needle aspiration or simple I&D is specifically discouraged due to higher recurrence compared with catheterization or marsupialization, illustrating a broader principle that incomplete drainage without addressing the cyst architecture predisposes to relapse [^11365H2N]. Conversely, if an abscess is mistaken for a sterile cyst, there is a risk of delayed antibiotics and inadequate source control with potential progression to severe infection or even peritonitis in intra-abdominal cystic disease, highlighting why timely recognition of suppuration matters [^1113KA3B]. Wait, let me verify the approach to an infected mucoid cyst: addressing both the cyst and the superinfection is critical — case series of digital mucoid cysts report infections managed successfully with antibiotics and, when needed, debridement, while definitive surgical excision of the cyst has the lowest recurrence when the acute infection has resolved or is controlled [^116SVLps].

> Let me synthesize a cautious diagnostic algorithm, but first, I should double-check that each step is evidence-aligned and not overly rigid. Begin with a careful clinical history emphasizing chronicity and prior episodes suggestive of a longstanding cyst versus an acute infectious timeline, and assess risk factors for secondary infection such as immunocompromise or cystic fibrosis when sinonasal disease is suspected [^113GagZY]. Proceed with baseline labs (WBC, CRP, ESR) to support or refute systemic inflammation, and obtain targeted imaging: ultrasound for superficial lesions, contrast-enhanced CT for suspected intra-abdominal/pelvic abscess, and MRI as a problem-solver for deep neck or complex cystic lesions, recognizing the constraints and characteristic signs of cyst infection such as thickened enhancing walls, DWI hyperintensity, and perilesional inflammatory change, while remembering that imaging alone often cannot type cysts reliably in other domains like the pancreas [^1174tgeC] [^115GLgmE] [^116Dhx4f]. When safe and appropriate, consider image-guided aspiration to analyze fluid for cytology (epithelial cells vs neutrophilic purulence), Gram stain/culture, and biochemical characteristics, integrating results with imaging to steer management, and escalate to definitive surgical excision when diagnosis remains uncertain or when recurrent misdiagnosis is suspected, both to treat and to secure histopathology [^115Q9K1s] [^112mYzUt]. Hold on, I should verify the cautionary note: even with advanced tools, final categorization often requires that integrated clinicoradiologic-pathologic correlation emphasized in mucinous lesion frameworks to properly guide therapy and follow-up [^115uRt7v].

> In conclusion, the recurring mechanisms behind mistaking a mucoid cyst for an abscess include secondary infection transforming a sterile lesion into a mucopyocele, atypical locations that promote diagnostic anchoring, and inflammatory changes that obscure underlying cyst architecture, all of which can lead to unnecessary antibiotics, ineffective drainage, delayed definitive therapy, or, in the reverse direction, dangerous under-treatment of true abscesses [^112mYzUt] [^116SVLps]. I need to ensure that my approach integrates clinical tempo, systemic markers, and multimodality imaging with an early threshold for tissue sampling or excision when uncertainty persists, aligning with the principle that accurate diagnosis often rests on clinicoradiologic-pathologic correlation to optimize outcomes and prevent repeated, inappropriate procedures [^115uRt7v].

Mucoid cysts are often mistaken for abscesses because both can present as **fluctuant, tender swellings** with overlying erythema and warmth [^111K5b42]. Key clinical clues favoring a mucoid cyst include **slow, painless growth** with a translucent or bluish hue and a history of trauma or degenerative joint disease. Imaging is **decisive**: ultrasound shows an **anechoic or hypoechoic lesion** without internal debris or vascularity, while MRI reveals a well-defined, non-enhancing cystic lesion with low T1 and high T2 signal [^1178BLAv]; by contrast, abscesses show rim enhancement and restricted diffusion [^115Q9K1s]. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary antibiotics, incision and drainage, and recurrence. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion, imaging, and histopathology** when needed [^112X2MsW].

---

## Clinical features leading to misdiagnosis

Mucoid cysts and abscesses share clinical features that may lead to **misdiagnosis** [^111K5b42]:

- **Swelling**: Both present as localized swellings, often fluctuant and tender [^115Q9K1s].

- **Erythema and warmth**: Overlying skin may appear erythematous and warm in both conditions [^111K5b42].

- **Pain**: Abscesses are typically painful, while mucoid cysts are usually painless or mildly tender.

- **Discharge**: Abscesses may discharge purulent material, whereas mucoid cysts may leak clear, viscous fluid if ruptured [^1137QRmf].

These similarities may **mislead clinicians**, especially in acute settings that demand rapid decision-making [^112X2MsW].

---

## Distinguishing clinical features

Despite similarities, certain clinical features can help **differentiate** mucoid cysts from abscesses:

| **Feature** | **Mucoid cyst** | **Abscess** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Slow, gradual | Rapid, acute |
| Pain | Usually painless or mildly tender | Typically painful |
| Consistency | Fluctuant, gelatinous | Fluctuant, purulent |
| Skin changes | Translucent or bluish hue | Erythema, warmth, induration |
| Systemic symptoms | Absent | Fever, malaise, leukocytosis |
| History | Trauma or degenerative joint disease | Infection or recent injury |

---

## Imaging modalities and diagnostic techniques

Imaging plays a **crucial role** in differentiating mucoid cysts from abscesses [^111K5b42]:

- **Ultrasound**: Mucoid cysts appear as well-defined, anechoic or hypoechoic lesions without internal debris or vascularity. Abscesses show complex fluid collections with internal debris and peripheral hyperemia [^111K5b42].

- **MRI**: Mucoid cysts exhibit low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with well-defined margins and no enhancement. Abscesses show rim enhancement and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) [^1178BLAv] [^115Q9K1s].

- **CT scan**: Useful for deep or complex lesions, providing detailed anatomical information [^112X2MsW].

- **Aspiration and fluid analysis**: Clear, viscous fluid suggests a mucoid cyst, while purulent fluid indicates an abscess [^1137QRmf].

---

## Histopathological differences

Histopathological examination provides **definitive differentiation**. A mucoid cyst is lined by flattened or cuboidal epithelial cells and contains clear, viscous mucinous material, whereas an abscess is characterized by acute inflammatory infiltrate, necrotic debris, and purulent material.

---

## Consequences of misdiagnosis

Misdiagnosing a mucoid cyst as an abscess can lead to **unnecessary antibiotic therapy** that is ineffective for cysts and exposes patients to medication side effects. Inappropriate incision and drainage, while indicated for abscesses, can cause recurrence or complications in mucoid cysts. Delayed accurate diagnosis postpones definitive treatment, prolonging discomfort and increasing recurrence risk [^111K5b42].

---

## Preventing misdiagnosis

To **prevent misdiagnosis**, clinicians should [^111K5b42]:

- **Conduct thorough clinical evaluation**: Carefully assess clinical features, history, and systemic symptoms [^112X2MsW].

- **Utilize appropriate imaging**: Ultrasound and MRI are valuable tools for accurate diagnosis [^115Q9K1s].

- **Perform aspiration and fluid analysis**: Analyze aspirated fluid to differentiate between cystic and purulent lesions [^1137QRmf].

- **Consider histopathological examination**: When uncertainty persists, histopathology provides definitive diagnosis.

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Treatment **differs significantly** between mucoid cysts and abscesses. Mucoid cysts are definitively treated with **surgical excision** (reported recurrence rate, 22.5%) [^113B7bSq]; aspiration and injection are less effective, with higher recurrence rates [^116SVLps]. Abscesses require incision and drainage combined with antibiotic therapy [^115Q9K1s].

Mucoid cysts can be mistaken for abscesses due to similar clinical presentations. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation, imaging, and histopathology** [^111K5b42]. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary antibiotics, inappropriate surgery, and delayed treatment.

### Treatment of mucous cysts of the fingers: Review of 134 cases with minimum 2-year follow-up evaluation [^116SVLps]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the results of a single surgeon's treatment of mucoid cysts, this study compared outcomes between injection and surgery.

One hundred thirty-four cysts were treated, with a minimum 2-year follow-up period. Thirty-one patients presented with nail ridging or deformity. Eighty patients underwent multiple soft-tissue punctures into the cyst with a 25-gauge needle, followed by injection with local anesthetic and steroid. Fifty-four patients underwent surgical excision and joint debridement.

In the injection group, complete resolution of the cyst occurred in 48 cases (60%). Among the 32 that recurred, repeat injections were performed in 8 cases, resulting in resolution in 3 cases. In contrast, no recurrences were noted in the surgery group. Nail ridging resolved after surgery in 25 digits; the remaining 6 digits had partial improvement or persistent ridging. Five infections occurred and were treated successfully with antibiotics (4) or debridement (1), or both.

Aspiration and injection were convenient but had a 40% recurrence rate. Surgery provided definitive treatment with no major long-term problems.

### Effectiveness and safety of surgical excision in the treatment of digital mucoid cysts [^113B7bSq]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Digital mucoid cysts have a tendency for recurrence after operative intervention. Several procedures are in use.

- **Objective**: Retrospective evaluation for effectiveness, safety, and patient satisfaction by using a questionnaire after treatment for digital mucoid cysts with targeted surgical excision and closure by flap-design.

- **Materials and methods**: All patients treated with surgical excision for digital mucoid cysts at the Dermatology Department of the Ludwigshafen City Hospital between 2007 and 2011 were evaluated using a specially designed questionnaire.

- **Results**: We evaluated 31 patients. The patient group consisted of 65% women, with a median age of 61 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients with nail involvement had a marked improvement or complete resolution of this complaint after surgery. A few complications (e.g. redness, pain, or hematoma) were observed after treatment, but no patients required oral antibiotics. Patient evaluation of cosmetic outcome revealed high satisfaction with the procedure; nevertheless, recurrence of the digital mucoid cysts was observed in 22.5% of all cases.

- **Conclusion**: Surgical excision in the treatment of digital mucoid cysts was shown to be effective and safe. However, possible advantages and disadvantages of this treatment option should be discussed with the patients before a decision on the kind of therapy is reached.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: What the radiologist needs to know [^1178BLAv]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Intra-articular ganglia are uncommon cystic lesions that typically arise from the cruciate ligaments, most commonly from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). On MRI, part of the lesion is interspersed within the ACL fibers, and it may extend anteriorly towards the Hoffa's fat pad or posteriorly towards the femoral intercondylar fossa. Rarely, it may be demonstrated between the ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).

PCL ganglia have a more typical appearance and present as well-defined multilocular cysts adjacent to and along the dorsal PCL surface. Differential diagnosis should be made from a posteromedial meniscal cyst extending centrally within the joint, predominantly posterior to the PCL. Ganglia within Hoffa's fat pad or in the suprapatellar recess-bursa usually appear as well-defined multilocular cysts and are most commonly encountered anterior to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus.

An intrahoffatic lesion or a synovial lesion such as hemangioma or synovial sarcoma may be misinterpreted as a ganglion cyst within the fat pad, and contrast-enhanced MRI is warranted in such cases for differential diagnosis.

- **Fig. 3**: ACL ganglion cysts. Two sequential sagittal fat-saturated proton density-weighted images in two different patients (upper and lower row) demonstrate a cystic lesion (black arrow) at the upper segment of the ACL, with part of the lesion (white arrow) dispersing into the ACL fibers.

- **Fig. 4**: PCL ganglion cyst. The sagittal (a) and axial (b) fat-saturated proton density-weighted images show a multiloculated septated cyst.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^114HCCyD]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Infected thyroglossal duct cyst involves some thyroglossal duct cysts that may not appear as simple thin-walled unilocular lesions. The presence of internal high attenuation, internal debris, and septations generally correlates with prior infection. In active or recent infection, patients may complain of tenderness at the site of a rapidly growing neck mass. Subsequent imaging reveals a thick-walled cyst with rim enhancement and inflammatory changes of the surrounding subcutaneous tissues. Internal contents may vary, with higher complexity reflecting proteinaceous debris, which may be seen in acute or remote infection. In advanced cases, abscess formation can occur; these will show restricted diffusion on MR imaging if there is doubt on ultrasound or CT.

- **Fistula formation**: May develop in severe infections with external cyst rupture or recurrence after resection, although congenital fistula in the newborn related to complete persistence of the thyroglossal tract after birth have been reported. Acquired fistulas can be distinguished from congenital cases based on later age of presentation (late childhood to early adulthood) and focal irregularity. Focal enlargement of the tract on fistulography may represent the site of a ruptured cyst or prior resection.

- **Case example**: A 23-year-old male presented with several days of fever and a warm anterior neck mass. A long-axis ultrasound image with color Doppler revealed a thick-walled hypoechoic structure containing low-level echoes with peripheral hyperemia in the paramedian anterior neck.

### Incidental mucocele of the appendix in a 15-year-old girl [^116VBFkh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Mucocele of the appendix is an exceedingly uncommon pathology in the pediatric population. It may present with abdominal pain or occur as an incidental finding after routine abdominal imaging. The etiologies can be inflammatory or neoplastic, but they all share the characteristic of chronic appendiceal obstruction. Early diagnosis is critical for positive long-term outcomes since the operative management differs from that of a dilated appendix secondary to acute appendicitis.

### Mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament: MRI, clinical, intraoperative, and histological findings [^116iCrHF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical, MRI, intraoperative, and histological features of mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), this study included 10 patients with an average age of 47 years (ranging from 19 to 69 years). These patients underwent surgery due to clinical diagnoses of mucoid degeneration of the ACL. All participants received preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were treated arthroscopically.

- **Results**: All 10 patients reported experiencing preoperative posterior knee pain. MRI findings showed a thickened ACL with increased signal on all sequences. Postoperatively, only six out of the ten patients were confirmed by biopsy to have mucoid degeneration of the ACL. An associated intraosseous tibial cyst or ganglion was observed only in patients with a definitive diagnosis of mucoid degeneration.

- **Conclusions**: Mucoid degeneration of the ACL can be suspected in patients with posterior knee pain accompanied by a thickened ACL. Associated findings, such as an intraosseous tibial or ganglion cyst, are useful in ruling out differential diagnoses.

### Clinical and arthroscopic features of meniscal tears and a search for the role of infection in histologically confirmed meniscal mucoid degeneration [^113DKsDc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Mucoid degeneration (MD) of the meniscus has received little attention. The pathology deserves special interest as it may lead to loss of the meniscus even in very young individuals. The cause of MD and the clinical features of meniscal tears due to this pathology have not been understood. This study analyzed the age profile and the role of trauma in patients with torn menisci with MD, examined meniscal tear patterns and clinical features, and investigated the role of bacterial infection in causing MD.

Meniscal samples obtained from 27 consecutive patients during arthroscopic resection of torn menisci — considered to be due to MD (typical yellow color) — underwent pathological investigation. The samples were scored according to the light microscopic criteria of Copenhaver; 24 menisci (23 patients) with stage 2–3 MD comprised the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging obtained in 11 patients typically revealed increased intrasubstance signal intensity that extended to at least one of the meniscal surfaces.

Pieces of resected meniscal tissue were also subject to PCR investigation to search for the presence of bacteria. Of the 24 knees, 21 (87%) had no history of trauma. Mean Tegner activity level was 4 (1 and 7). Mean duration of symptoms was 11.6 months (1–36). Pain was the most frequent symptom (n = 22). Joint line tenderness and McMurray's test (pain and/or clicking) were present in 22 and 16 knees, respectively. The medial meniscus was affected in 16, and the lateral meniscus in 8. Meniscal cyst and incomplete discoid meniscus were present in 5 and 2 of the lateral menisci.

### Radiological manifestations of thoracic hydatid cysts: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary findings [^112f6Tmu]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Hydatid disease should always be considered in the differential diagnosis when a cystic lesion is detected in a patient hailing from an endemic area. The differential diagnosis for pulmonary hydatid cysts can include bronchogenic cysts, lung carcinoma, primary sarcoma of the lung, metastasis (particularly for multiple hydatid cysts), hematoma, mesothelioma, granuloma, and abscesses.

- **Figure 10 description**: Axial CT image shows an opacification with smooth contours, identified pathologically as a bronchogenic cyst (red arrow).

### A rare case of posterior vaginal wall cyst [^114quAdz]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old multipara presented with a mass protruding from the vagina for one year. The mass was cystic in nature, arising from the posterior vaginal wall. It was insidious in growth, gradually increasing in size to 8 × 8 cm. Surgical excision of the cyst was performed using sharp and blunt dissection. The cyst was filled with mucoid material, and histopathology confirmed a Mullerian cyst.

Cystic lesions of the vagina are relatively uncommon and are often incidental findings during gynecological examinations. Mullerian cysts are congenital cysts of the vagina, usually reported during the childbearing age group. These cysts typically arise at the level of the cervix and extend anteriorly in relation to the bladder, but very rarely they may also extend posteriorly. This paper illustrates a rare case of a large posterior vaginal wall cyst of Mullerian origin.

### Parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma mimicking a large mucocele [^114uBbmH]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor involving the parotid gland and minor salivary glands. Parotid pure cystic mucoepidermoid carcinoma can also masquerade as a mucocele; hence, histopathological examination is crucial to distinguish the two. Herein, the authors report a patient with mucoepidermoid carcinoma presenting as an asymptomatic mucocele-like cystic parotid mass. A 69-year-old female presented with a cystic parotid mass; her examination findings and diagnostic imaging were consistent with a mucocele. Histological examination revealed mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This case indicates that parotid mucocele-like cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of malignant salivary gland tumors.

### Facial swelling for the emergency radiologist-typical and atypical causes [^112X2MsW]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

There are a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and cystic lesions that may prompt patients to seek acute care for facial swelling. Computed tomography (CT) has become the mainstay for imaging in urgent and emergent settings. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also serve as a powerful problem-solving tool in the modern era. As patient volume continues to increase, emergency radiologists will encounter a wide variety of facial pathology. Recognizing both common and uncommon pathologies will assist in diagnosis and value-based care. This article serves as an image-rich review of the many causes of facial swelling, emphasizing key imaging findings and possible complications.

### The spectrum of mucinous lesions of the breast [^115uRt7v]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mucinous lesions of the breast encompass many entities ranging from benign to malignant and non-neoplastic to neoplastic. Lesions discussed under this category include mucocele-like lesion, mucinous carcinoma, mucinous micropapillary carcinoma, solid papillary carcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma with extracellular mucin, mucinous ductal carcinoma in situ, and metastasis.

- **Objective**: To review clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of mucinous lesions of the breast, their differential diagnoses, and challenging features on core needle biopsies.

- **Data sources**: The existing scientific and clinical literature as of December 2021.

- **Conclusions**: The category of mucinous lesions of the breast is vast, and the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially on core needle biopsies. In all cases, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlation is necessary to reach a comprehensive diagnosis. Given that the prognosis and management of each entity is different, being aware of these entities and their nuances is critical for a pathologist to guide accurate management.

### Management of Bartholin's duct cyst and gland abscess [^113YkcUS]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Bartholin's duct cysts and gland abscesses are common problems in women of reproductive age. Bartholin's glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus and drain through ducts that empty into the vestibule at approximately the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. These normally pea-sized glands become palpable only if the duct becomes cystic or a gland abscess develops. The differential diagnosis includes cystic and solid lesions of the vulva, such as epidermal inclusion cyst, Skene's duct cyst, hidradenoma papilliferum, and lipoma. The goal of management is to preserve the gland and its function, if possible. Office-based procedures include the insertion of a Word catheter for a duct cyst or gland abscess and marsupialization of a cyst; marsupialization should not be used to treat a gland abscess. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is warranted only when cellulitis is present. Excisional biopsy is reserved for ruling out adenocarcinoma in menopausal or perimenopausal women with an irregular, nodular Bartholin's gland mass.

### Bilateral lateral periodontal cyst [^114SF7XL]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The bilateral lateral periodontal cyst is a rare nasological entity, which, despite clinical and radiological presentation, is diagnosed by histological characteristics. It is asymptomatic in nature and is often observed during routine radiography. This article presents a rare case of bilateral lateral periodontal cyst in a 14-year-old child.

The clinical and radiographical findings, along with its management, have been discussed. Enucleation of the bilateral cyst without extraction of the adjacent tooth was performed. Lesion samples were sent for histopathological analysis. The histopathological analysis revealed a thin, non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium resembling reduced enamel epithelium, with epithelial plaques also observed. A clinicopathological correlation, incorporating the surgical, radiographical, and gold standard histopathological findings, was obtained to suggest the final diagnosis of the bilateral lateral periodontal cyst.

### Infected dermoid sinus tract mimicking recurrent sinusitis in an adolescent male [^112mCMhz]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Nasal dermoid sinus cysts are the most common congenital midline nasofrontal masses, but they can easily be confused with simple recurrent sinusitis upon clinical presentation. We report the case of a 14-year-old male who was initially diagnosed with frontal sinusitis and treated with antibiotics. However, after multiple episodes of recurrence, he was later sent for imaging. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an infected dermoid sinus tract. Subsequent surgery removed the mass, and pathologic investigation confirmed the diagnosis.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: Can we differentiate [^114dKge5]? Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Several infectious and inflammatory conditions may mimic neoplastic processes on imaging studies, making differential diagnosis challenging. Clinical history and patient demographics are critical for a correct diagnosis, in addition to imaging findings. Image-guided biopsy may be employed for definitive differential diagnosis in selected patients.

### Treatment of temporomandibular joint ganglion cyst [^112Xp6XH]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts of the temporomandibular joint are very rare and often misdiagnosed as synovial cysts, parotid gland tumors, or other cystic lesions. They present with pain, swelling, or dysfunction. Imaging studies can help identify the tumor mass from the adjacent soft tissue, but a definitive diagnosis is made from the pathological report. A 59-year-old woman presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of a painless swelling mass in the right preauricular region of 3-month duration. Computed tomography was performed, showing a small radiolucent lesion adjacent to the right condyle. Local excision was performed, and the specimen was sent for histologic examination.

Microscopic examination revealed a cystic space walled by dense fibrous connective tissue without epithelial or endothelial lining. Immunohistochemical staining of these lining cells showed positivity for vimentin and negativity for cytokeratin. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst.

Ganglion cysts present as unilobulate or multilobulate cysts that arise from collagenous tissue and are filled with highly viscous fluid. They do not communicate with the joint cavity. In contrast, a synovial cyst is a true cyst lined by cuboidal or flattened cells from the synoviocytes and filled with gelatinous fluid; it may or may not communicate with the joint cavity.

Excision is the treatment of choice for symptomatic cystic lesions. Incomplete excision of these lesions may lead to recurrence or infection. Thus, injection of hydrocortisone or aspiration may be considered as alternative treatments.

### Hydatid necessitans-an unusual entity [^113G9rp8]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old female patient presented with complaints of cough with mucoid expectoration and a dull, aching upper abdominal pain of 6 months' duration. Clinical examination revealed a diffuse, non-tender prominence in the right lower chest wall. The chest X-ray showed a well-defined homogeneous opacity in the right lower hemithorax overlying the dome of the diaphragm and another well-defined round opacity in the right upper lobe of the lung. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax and abdomen revealed a hydatid cyst in the upper, middle, and lower lobes of the right lung. There was another large hydatid cyst in the right pleural cavity, extending laterally to the subcutaneous plane of the chest wall through the ninth intercostal space, splaying the adjacent ribs. There was no communication with the adjacent lung. Multiple intra-abdominal cysts were present. Through a right posterolateral thoracotomy, the pulmonary cysts were excised, and the large herniating cyst was emptied and deroofed. After an uneventful recovery, she was discharged on anthelmintics and was followed up by the general surgeons for management of the abdominal hydatids.

### Atypical chest pain in a young woman with an interatrial bronchogenic cyst [^112wn3Mh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Bronchogenic cysts are congenital anomalies that originate from the primitive ventral foregut. These cysts typically contain mucoid material and are lined by ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium. The most common locations are mediastinal, intrapulmonary, or in the lower neck.

Patients are usually asymptomatic, but those who are symptomatic often present with cough and chest pain. A less common yet dramatic manifestation might include respiratory distress, stridor, and hypoxia from airway compromise. Intracardiac bronchogenic cysts are rare; however, when present, they are most commonly located in the interatrial septum. A review of the literature reveals various clinical presentations depending on the cyst location, including complete heart block, dyspnea secondary to vascular obstruction, and atrial fibrillation.

Atrial flutter is rarely observed in a young patient without a known cardiac history. Such a presentation warrants investigation for biological or structural causes. The management of bronchogenic cysts is typically surgical excision.

### Unique case of glandular odontogenic cyst showing mucoepidermoid carcinoma-like islands in cystic wall [^113G7DMc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Glandular odontogenic cyst (GOC) is a very rare jaw cyst, accounting for 0.2% of all odontogenic cysts. It typically presents in adults, with a slight male predominance. Radiologically, histopathologically, and even immunohistochemically, it overlaps with low-grade intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), making their distinction crucial.

A 57-year-old woman with bilocular radiolucency in the anterior mandible crossing the midline is described here. The microscopy features were consistent with a glandular odontogenic cyst, but multiple MEC-like islands were observed in the capsule, creating a diagnostic dilemma with low-grade intraosseous MEC. However, the absence of cellular atypia and the lack of epidermoid and intermediate cells led to a final diagnosis of GOC, with close follow-up of the patient recommended. This rare finding highlights the relationship between GOC and MEC, or the potential origin of MEC from GOC.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^114YVq9h]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

In the diagnosis of neoplastic pancreatic cysts, particularly concerning cyst fluid analysis, ACG 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining molecular markers. This approach is suggested to identify intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms when the diagnosis is uncertain and the results have the potential to alter management.

### Orbital tumours and tumour-like lesions: Exploring the armamentarium of multiparametric imaging [^111nfZ9V]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Malignant epithelial lacrimal gland tumours represent approximately 50% of all epithelial lacrimal gland tumours and include adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma types such as the mammary analog secretory carcinoma of salivary origin (Fig. 10). Overall, these tumours are quite rare, accounting for less than 5% of all lacrimal gland lesions. Recognizing malignant lacrimal gland tumours at an early stage is crucial due to their high morbidity and mortality.

ACC is a high-grade malignancy, accounting for 29% of all epithelial lacrimal gland tumours and up to 50% of all malignant epithelial lacrimal gland neoplasms. Its incidence peaks in the 4th decade. Patients typically present with a hard mass in the upper lateral orbit, often accompanied by pain caused by perineural spread or bony invasion. Perineural spread indicates a poorer prognosis. Radical resection with broad margins is the treatment of choice for small, low-grade tumours. Survival rates vary from 5 years in 40% of patients to 15 years in 58% of patients. Histologically, these tumours lack a mesenchymal matrix and exhibit various histological types including tubular, comedo-carcinoma, basaloid, or cribriform patterns. The cribriform pattern is characterized by sheets of basaloid epithelial cells and surrounding spaces of varying shapes, giving rise to a characteristic Swiss cheese appearance.

### Oral mucoceles: A clinicopathologic review of 1,824 cases, including unusual variants [^1137QRmf]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

To review the clinicopathologic features of oral mucoceles, with special consideration given to unusual variants and exclusion of salivary duct cysts, this retrospective consecutive case review was conducted. The study analyzed all oral mucoceles diagnosed by the Medical University of South Carolina, Oral Pathology Biopsy Laboratory, from 1997 to 2006. Recorded data included patient demographics, clinical features (anatomic location, color, size, and consistency), clinical impression, history of trauma, history of periodic rupture, and occurrence of unusual mucocele variants.

During the study period, 1,824 oral mucoceles were diagnosed. Among these, 1,715 were histopathologically confirmed non-recurrence cases. There was no significant gender predilection; the average age was 24.9 years. The most common locations were the lower labial mucosa (81.9%), floor of mouth (5.8%), ventral tongue (5.0%), and buccal mucosa (4.8%). Infrequent sites included the palate (1.3%) and retromolar area (0.5%). Lesions were most often described as blue, purple, gray, or normal in color. The mean maximum diameter was 0.8 cm, ranging from 0.1 to 4.0 cm. A history of trauma was reported in 456 cases, while a history of periodic rupture was noted in 366 cases. Unusual variants included superficial mucoceles (n = 3), mucoceles with myxoglobulosis (n = 6), and mucoceles with papillary synovial metaplasialike change (n = 2).

Our results confirm the findings of previous investigators regarding the major clinicopathologic features of oral mucoceles.

### Retrorectal cyst: A rare tumor frequently misdiagnosed [^112mYzUt]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

The rarity of retrorectal cysts and their nonspecific clinical presentations often lead to misdiagnoses and inappropriate operations. In recent years, several patients have been referred to our institutions for evaluation and treatment of misdiagnosed retrorectal cysts. A review of these patients is presented.

- **Study design**: Medical records of the colorectal surgery divisions at two institutions were reviewed. Patients found to have previously misdiagnosed retrorectal cysts were identified. Preliminary diagnoses, radiologic examinations, operative procedures, and final diagnoses were obtained.

- **Results**: Seven patients with retrorectal cysts who had been misdiagnosed before referral were identified. These patients had been treated for fistulae in ano, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses; psychogenic, lower back, posttraumatic, or postpartum pain, and proctalgia fugax before the correct diagnosis was made. Patients underwent an average of 4.1 operative procedures. Physical examination in combination with CT scanning made the correct diagnosis in all patients. All patients underwent successful resection through a parasacrococcygeal approach, and six of seven did not require coccygectomy. The resected tumors included four hamartomas, two epidermoid cysts, and one enteric duplication cyst.

- **Conclusions**: Retrorectal cysts are a rare entity that can be difficult to diagnose without a high index of clinical suspicion. A history of multiple unsuccessful procedures should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of retrorectal cyst. Once suspected, the correct diagnosis…

### Clear cell adenomatoid odontogenic tumour and dentigerous cyst: An uncommon hybrid combination - case and review [^1149FNzA]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Odontogenic tumours and cysts have a characteristic presentation, both histopathologically and clinically. The diagnostic criteria and nomenclature are distinct, as elaborated in the 2017 WHO classification. Occasionally, however, one might find an association between different odontogenic tumours and cysts, such as the calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour (CEOT) and adenomatoid odontogenic tumour (AOT), or CEOT and ghost cell tumour. Some odontogenic tumours and cysts share their site of occurrence, intraosseous location, involved teeth or quadrant, and histopathology. Consequently, these lesions are often considered for differential diagnoses in many cases. However, there are instances where hybrid or associated tumour and cyst cases are reported. Here, we present a case of a dentigerous cyst in association with AOT, which exhibited variation in cell type, pattern, and induction pattern.

### Dermoid cyst of the parotid gland [^117CVjz6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A dermoid cyst is an ectodermally differentiated form of teratoma. Its occurrence in the parotid gland is very rare. Such a presentation must be properly evaluated in order to rule out malignancy. We describe the diagnostic evaluation and surgical management of a parotid dermoid cyst in an 18-year-old man. We also review the embryologic pathogenesis of the tumor and the usefulness of the physical examination, preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography in evaluating the extent of the tumor, its histologic features, and its cystic characteristics. Finally, we discuss the role of surgical management in terms of preserving facial nerve integrity and preventing recurrence.

### An atypical presentation of sinus mucopyocele in a pediatric cystic fibrosis patient [^113GagZY]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

It is always important to consider the adjacent sinuses when managing a patient with chronic periocular symptomatology, particularly allergic disease, even in pediatric cases. Of further note is that in the specific condition of cystic fibrosis (CF), mucoceles are more common and are more likely to be infected (i.e. mucopyoceles), while in otherwise normal patients they are almost uniformly sterile. This is an important distinction for patients with CF, since a chronic source of bacterial infection in the upper airway can become the source of infection spread to the lower airway. The latter infections are the major determinant of long-term outcome in such patients. Our case report highlights that chronic conjunctivitis in CF patients that is refractory to standard management should lead to a thorough evaluation, including bacterial cultures and, in some cases, neuroimaging to determine and properly treat a putative underlying cause.

### Intraorbital cystic lesions: An imaging spectrum [^115VTxDg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of a cyst or a cystic component in an intraorbital mass often narrows the list of differential diagnoses to specific entities. Such a lesion in the orbit may arise from structures within the orbit, globe, and lacrimal system, or from neighboring paranasal sinuses or meninges. Common congenital and developmental lesions encountered within the orbit include dermoids and epidermoids, and infrequently, coloboma. Parasitic cysts (cysticercus), orbital abscess, mucocele, and vascular lesions are the most common acquired pathologies giving rise to fluid-containing lesions within the orbit.

The role of a radiologist is crucial in expediting the diagnosis of orbital lesions with the help of characteristic imaging features on ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. It also helps in identifying complications in others, where formulation of an early and effective management strategy is vital for preserving vision.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatic cysts, specifically concerning the evaluation of mucinous cystic neoplasms, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend viewing a combination of at least one major and one minor feature as worrisome for mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver.

- **Major features**: Thick septation, nodularity.
- **Minor features**: Upstream biliary dilatation, thin septations, internal hemorrhage, perfusional change, and fewer than three coexistent hepatic cysts.

### Anterior cruciate ligament mucoid degeneration: A review of the literature and management guidelines [^1118dmXu]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) mucoid degeneration is a rare condition in clinical practice, distinct but often confused with ACL mucoid cysts. Its pathophysiology remains unclear; however, recent publications suggest that it might be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and the adverse effects of treatment by ACL resection might be underestimated. The objective of this work was to summarize scattered knowledge to improve patient management.

The authors conducted an exhaustive and comprehensive review of up-to-date literature. An extensive search of the MEDLINE database was carried out using MESH terms (ganglion cyst, anterior cruciate ligament) and generic search terms (mucoid degeneration, hypertrophy).

Anterior cruciate ligament mucoid degeneration is characterized by interstitial glycosaminoglycan deposits amidst the collagen bundles, causing ACL hypertrophy, knee pain, and limited range of motion. It is thought to arise from a primary synovial lesion and is associated with arthritic changes or subsequent acute or repeated trauma. Diagnosis is made through MRI scans and confirmed on histopathological samples. Treatment involving ACL arthroscopic resection is effective in addressing pain and range of motion but is not a benign procedure and may cause knee laxity.

Anterior cruciate ligament mucoid degeneration needs to be more broadly recognized and properly diagnosed to improve management strategies. Further research is necessary to confirm trends in the literature, which suggest adopting a less aggressive approach.

### Mucocele-like lesions of the sphenoid sinus with hypointense foci on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [^116Bas1W]. Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Lesions limited to the sphenoid sinus are relatively rare and obscure with respect to symptoms and physical findings. The differential diagnosis of isolated sphenoid sinus disease includes bacterial sinusitis, fungal infection, granulomatous inflammation, mucocele, and tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information that closely reflects the composition of the tissues, sometimes permitting differentiation between pathologically distinct lesions showing similar density by computed tomography.

We describe two cases involving mucocele-like lesions of the sphenoid sinus where preoperative MRI revealed a focus of hypointensity within the lesions. In both patients, the sphenoid sinus was opened by a transnasal endoscopic approach, and diseased tissue corresponding to the hypointense area was removed under direct endoscopic vision. Histopathological diagnosis revealed colonies of Aspergillus in one case and necrotic granulation tissue without fungus in the other.

We concluded that MRI is a crucial part of preoperative evaluation and that the transnasal endoscopic approach represents a safe and effective method for treating nonmalignant isolated sphenoid sinus disease.

### Mucinous breast lesions: diagnostic challenges [^113gF8Qn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Breast lesions with mucin represent a broad spectrum of entities, ranging from benign fibrocystic changes with luminal mucin to mucocele-like lesions (MLL), which can be associated with banal epithelial alterations, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or ductal carcinoma in situ. Occasionally, invasive mucinous carcinoma can be identified in contiguity with MLL. Diagnostic challenges are enumerated, histological differentials are discussed, and a practical approach towards resolving some of these issues is provided. In addition to these lesions with abundant extracellular mucin, there are also conditions that feature stromal mucinous or myxoid material, as well as rare entities that demonstrate both epithelial extracellular and stromal mucin.

### Cecal epidermoid cyst: A neonatal case with clinicopathological consideration [^115LJ1nF]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The cyst is located at the subserosal layer of the cecal wall (arrows), which is composed of stratified squamous epithelium and submucosal connective tissues (a, × 40), and the inner mucosal lining is focally composed of mucin-producing ciliated epithelium in some foci (b, × 200). Immunohistochemical staining shows that the cecal mucosa is reactive to MUC2 (c, × 40), while the cystic mucosa is reactive to MUC5AC (d, × 100).

The differential diagnoses include:

- **Mucocele**: This can show variable T1 signal intensity depending on protein contents, ranging from low to high. Typically, mucocele appears hyperintense on T2-weighted images and does not contain calcifications or metallic-density materials.

- **Sinonasal mucosal melanoma**: This condition shows high T1 signal intensity due to the presence of hemoglobin and melanin derivatives; it also demonstrates contrast enhancement of the internal component.

### Dorsal wrist ganglion: Clinical and imaging correlation in symptomatic population based on high-field MRI [^116Gizmr]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Dorsal mucoid cyst of the wrist is a benign condition relatively common in the symptomatic population, affecting mostly women between 30 and 40 years of age and is associated in 20 to 30% of cases with injury to the SL. MRI is the modality of choice for anatomical studies of this condition, with an excellent inter-observer agreement for detection and volumetric assessment. The technical improvement provided by high-field MRI should encourage the radiologist to accurately describe the anatomical relationships, size, and visibility of the pedicle using appropriate classification, as this information is essential for preoperative assessment.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: The role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, due to some similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. The latter may lead to elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand, emphasizing key points that assist in the differentiation between the two broad clinical categories of infections and inflammatory causes.

### Cystic adventitial disease masquerading as ganglion disease: a rare cause of intermittent claudication [^111TxAPf]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Cystic adventitial disease (CAD) is a rare cause of claudication in which a mucinous cyst forms within the adventitial layer of a blood vessel, most commonly the popliteal artery, resulting in luminal narrowing. This paper presents a case of a man in his mid-50s with unilateral lower limb popliteal artery CAD, which was not initially identified on either duplex ultrasonography or CT angiography. He was successfully treated with surgical resection of the affected segment of the popliteal artery and autologous vein grafting.

### Cholesterol granuloma of the maxillary sinus misdiagnosed as nasal polyp or mucocele: Four cases [^1179WofA]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Cholesterol granuloma is commonly found in the mastoid air cells but is rare in the paranasal sinuses. The most commonly affected sinuses are the frontal sinus, followed by the maxillary sinus. Cholesterol granuloma can be difficult to diagnose because clinical manifestations and radiologic findings are similar to those of other sinonasal disorders. The authors observed four cases of cholesterol granuloma that were preoperatively suspected to be nasal polyps or mucoceles. Here, the authors report on their clinical presentation and their successful treatment using the endoscopic sinus approach. These cases expand the literature on cholesterol granuloma in the paranasal sinuses.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^112TUvrC]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Dermoid and epidermoid cysts, also known as benign cystic teratomas, epidermoid cysts, and teratoid cysts, represent a spectrum of congenital and acquired cystic malformations. These share the common characteristic of having a squamous epithelial lining. The term "dermoid cysts" refers to three histologically distinct processes classified based on their lining: simple squamous epithelium (epidermoid), skin appendages (dermoid), or tissues of other major organs (teratoid). Dermoids and epidermoids originate from the dermal elements of the first and second branchial arches. It is crucial to distinguish between dermoid and epidermoid cysts and teratoid cysts, as the former possess a lower risk of malignant degeneration.

Although rare within the head and neck, dermoid and epidermoid cysts have a predilection for the oral cavity, particularly the floor of the mouth. Dermoid cysts typically present in the second or third decade of life as a slowly enlarging midline neck mass, which may progress to cause dysphagia, while epidermoid cysts manifest earlier in life, becoming evident in infancy.

On imaging, dermoid and epidermoid cysts can appear similar. Distinguishing features are derived from their unique histological composition. While both behave as cystic lesions on CT and MRI, dermoid cysts will demonstrate the hallmark finding of coalesced globules of fat resembling a "sac of marbles" in a medium of low CT attenuation and variable signal on T1-weighted images.

### Compressive optic neuropathy due to posterior ethmoid mucocele [^117UdaCu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Mucoceles are cystic formations characterized by the presence of mucus-secreting epithelial cells. When the excretory duct becomes obstructed, mucus accumulates within the cyst, leading to its enlargement. Posterior ethmoidal mucoceles are rare conditions that can potentially give rise to severe ocular complications requiring immediate intervention. The significance of posterior ethmoidal mucoceles lies in their close anatomical proximity to the optic nerve. Unilateral retrobulbar optic neuropathy can arise from various causes, often posing challenges in accurate diagnosis. In this report, we present a case involving a patient who developed optic nerve neuropathy as a result of a posterior ethmoidal mucocele. Herein, we elucidate the clinical presentation of a rapidly progressing compressive optic neuropathy secondary to a posterior ethmoidal mucocele.

An empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment was initiated. However, the evolution was marked by the presence of ongoing mediastinitis with persistent dyspnoea, fever, oxygen dependence, elevation of inflammatory biomarkers, and the development of confusion and hallucinations. As a consequence, surgical debridement of the involved mediastinum with resection of the cyst was performed. Taking into consideration the size of the cyst and the extent of mediastinitis, an open approach via a left hemiclamshell incision was performed.

### Case report: Misdiagnosis of tailgut cyst presenting as recurrent perianal fistula with pelvic abscess [^112xCoq4]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Tailgut cysts are uncommon lesions that usually occur within the presacral space. The relative rarity and nonspecific complaints associated with these lesions often lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessary procedures before the correct diagnosis is made. We describe a case of a 16-year-old female who presented with pelvic pain. She had previously undergone several procedures at an outside institution for a recurrent perianal fistula and perirectal abscess. Subsequent evaluation under anesthesia revealed a presacral cystic mass with a well-developed tract within the anorectal ring in the posterior midline. This mass was surgically removed using a combined transanal and posterior sagittal excision technique and was found to be a tailgut cyst upon pathologic evaluation. Tailgut cysts and other presacral masses should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients with an abscess in the presacral space or fistula within the anal canal. A variety of surgical approaches are available depending on the anatomy of the lesion.

### Maxillary sinus augmentation and implant installation in patients with pseudocysts and mucous retention cysts [^114zF7hN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

With the advent of implant procedures, bone augmentation has been studied to establish the base for endosseous implant placement in cases of severe atrophic alveolar processes. The height of both maxillary alveolar processes is affected by a prolonged edentulous state involving atrophic changes of the alveolar process over time. Together with atrophic bone, pneumatization of the maxillary sinus is also of great concern when planning to install implants in the posterior area of the maxilla. To overcome such difficulty, sinus augmentation is routinely conducted with satisfactory results. Unfortunately, another challenge for sinus augmentation before implant installation involving pathologic changes in the sinus is maxillary sinus cysts.

Although the nomenclature and pathogenesis of maxillary sinus cysts have largely been disputed, many researchers support classification into three groups: antral pseudocyst (PsC), mucous retention cyst (MRC), and true sinus mucocele. A PsC is not lined with epithelium but is composed of inflammatory exudate accumulation between the antral mucosa and the underlying bone. Unlike PsC, MRC, and mucoceles of the maxillary sinus are lined with epithelium. Retention cysts of the maxillary sinus are caused by blockage and dilatation of ducts of the seromucinous gland and are also lined with epithelium. The mucous retention cyst can be further classified into extravasation, luminal, and mixed type. Mucoceles of the maxillary sinus are expanding, destructive lesions that can perforate the walls of the sinus if not treated. The pathogenesis is impaired drainage.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^116fUc2Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, particularly with respect to surveillance imaging, ACG 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining short-interval MRI or EUS, with or without FNA, in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or mucinous cystic neoplasms. This recommendation is specifically for cases involving new onset or worsening diabetes mellitus or a rapid increase in cyst size (> 3 mm/year), as these patients may have an increased risk of malignancy.

### Abdominal cyst of unclear aetiology: Gastrointestinal stromal tumour or reactivation of abdominal tuberculosis [^115c89Jr]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for an abdominal mass is broad and includes infection, malignancy, and other inflammatory processes. Given the elevated C-reactive protein level, an inflammatory process was high on the differential diagnosis. The mass on the initial CT scan was concerning for a pyogenic abscess, thus an infectious process was considered to be most likely. Since the patient had a history of abdominal TB, reactivation of TB was of strong concern, prompting AFB smear and cultures to be obtained.

The patient's risk factors for abdominal TB combined with 4+AFB on an acid-fast smear were strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of TB infection. Remarkably, the patient's symptoms did not improve with antituberculous therapy, and AFB cultures did not reveal Mycobacterium tuberculosis, prompting a biopsy of the mass. Histopathology of the core needle biopsy strongly corroborated a diagnosis of GIST. However, a diagnosis of coinfection with M. tuberculosis was still under consideration due to the presence of AFB on a smear. Repeat cultures revealed M. chelonae, explaining the presence of AFB on the smear, and a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis was eliminated from the differential.

### Diagnosis and surgical treatment of a nasolabial cyst [^1166Fg1f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Nasolabial cysts are uncommonly diagnosed nonodontogenic soft tissue lesions located close to the nasal alar region of the face, presenting as extraosseous swelling in the region of the nasolabial fold. Nasolabial cysts are likely to remain undetected unless they become infected or are associated with facial deformity. Histologically, they are lined with nonkeratinized squamous epithelium or, more frequently, with respiratory-type cylindrical epithelium with goblet cells. The aim of this article was to present and discuss the surgical management of a case of nasolabial cyst and to briefly review the literature.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^115Q9K1s]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Mimics and difficult diagnoses - **Cystic masses**: Both benign and malignant cystic neck masses can become infected and mimic abscesses. Benign cystic masses include vascular malformations and developmental branchial cleft cysts and, if previously undiagnosed, are often diagnosed after the acute infection has dissipated (Fig. 31). Clinically, the most important malignant cystic neck mass that can be secondarily infected is the necrotic lymph node metastasis from neck mucosal space squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 32). The importance of this caveat is increasing because of the rising incidence of cystic necrotic metastases from human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal carcinoma, especially in young adults. Although not secondary to an underlying cystic mass, suppurative lymphadenitis refers to a collection of purulent fluid within an infected lymph node; imaging findings are similar to those of a true abscess or infected cystic mass, but diagnosis can often be made based on location and general lymphadenopathy.

MRI shows a large cystic mass (arrows) under a swollen sternocleidomastoid muscle on axial T2-weighted (a) and post-contrast T1-weighted (b) images. ADC map shows a layering of purulent fluid (c), consistent with a secondary infection of a cystic mass.

### A practical overview of CT and MRI features of developmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic lesions of the sphenoid body and clivus [^115ZuvMA]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Mucocele presents as a complete opacification of one or more paranasal sinuses; most frequently, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are filled with mucus, and their walls are lined by normal-appearing respiratory epithelium (Fig. 7). It is often associated with bony wall expansion and focal osseous resorption. The pathogenesis of mucocele remains unclear, but altered mucociliary clearance, cystic dilatation of the mucosal glands, and cystic development from embryonic remnants are all contributing factors, often in the context of chronic rhinosinusitis. Radiation therapy can also lead to an isolated sphenoid mucocele as a consequence of fibrous tissue formation obstructing the natural ostium.

Mucocele appears as a completely mucous-filled and expanded sinus with a typical rim enhancement — sign of encapsulation — and lack of intralesional CE. CT density and MRI signal intensity are variable, depending on the amount of water, mucus, and proteins. Most frequently, this lesion exhibits high water content with low density on CT, low signal intensity on T1-weighted (T1W), and high on T2-weighted (T2W) images; the high protein content results in high CT density, high signal intensity on T1W, and low signal intensity on T2W images. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are highly variable. When viscous protein-rich secretions are present, it may have very low ADC values (< 0.5 × 10−3 mm²/s).

- **Fig. 7**: Left sphenoid sinus mucocele with high protein content in a 53-year-old male patient with headache. MRI shows a large mass (white arrows) displacing the ipsilateral internal carotid artery posteriorly (white dotted arrow) on T2W axial image (a) and the pituitary gland superiorly.

### Is routine pathologic evaluation of sebaceous cysts necessary? A 15-year retrospective review of a single institution [^111cLrD5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A question arose in our practice of whether all cysts considered sebaceous should be sent for pathologic evaluation. To address this controversial topic, we performed a retrospective study of our single institution's histopathology database. A natural language search of the CoPath database across the institution was undertaken using the diagnosis of sebaceous cyst, epidermal cyst, epidermoid cyst, epithelial cyst, infundibular cyst, pilar cyst, trichilemmal cyst, and steatocystoma. A surgical pathologic review of all specimens with one of these preexcision diagnoses was included in the 15-year retrospective study of 1998 to 2013.

All slides were confirmed to have undergone histopathologic review, and the preexcision diagnoses were compared with the postexcision diagnoses. Chart review was undertaken in instances of a diagnosis of malignancy. A total of 13,746 samples were identified. Forty-eight specimens had histopathologic diagnosis of malignancy for an incidence of 0.3%, with the most common malignancy being squamous cell carcinoma. Chart review showed that for all cases, the surgeons reported uncertainty with regard to the diagnosis because of history or physical characteristics, or both.

In addition, a comprehensive literature review showed results consistent with our data and illustrated 19 cases during the past 10 years in which most of the findings were squamous cell carcinoma. We propose the recommendation that routine pathologic evaluation of sebaceous cysts is necessary only when clinical suspicion exists.

### Pitfalls in the surgical treatment of undiagnosed lung lesions and cystic pulmonary hydatidosis [^113EGJL4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The perforated hydatid cyst may become infected and form an abscess, displaying a common radiological pattern with infective lung lesions. Surgery is indicated for lung lesions that persist despite medical treatment or in the case of recurring abscesses. In our study, a lung abscess associated with bronchiectasis was detected in two patients, radiologically mimicking complicated hydatid cysts. Recognizing the clinical and biochemical signs of infection and arranging appropriate medical treatment will prevent unnecessary surgical interventions. It may be more difficult to elucidate the etiology in cases where empyema develops by opening the abscess cavity into the pleural space. In a study by Aribas et al, 145 patients hospitalized for hydatid cysts were reviewed, and pleural complications were detected in 40 patients. They found that empyema was one of the most common pleural complications, with a rate of 7.6%.

We included two patients who underwent tube thoracostomy with the diagnosis of empyema and were diagnosed with a hydatid cyst after surgical treatment due to prolonged air leak and suspected parenchymal opacities in the follow-ups. Our recommendation in cases of empyema is the careful evaluation of the lung parenchyma with thorax CT after the drainage of the purulent pleural contents and appropriate antibiotic therapy. In the presence of persistent cavitary or cystic parenchymal lesion despite pleural drainage and appropriate medical treatment, the possibility of a complicated hydatid cyst should be kept in mind.

### Broad, recurrent nasal dermoid cyst: A challenging task [^112bnVQC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Nasal dermoid sinus cyst is a rare congenital midline anomaly. The embryological origin is different from the dermoid cysts seen in other parts of the face. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts constitute 1% to 3% of all dermoid cysts and 11% to 12% of head and neck dermoid cysts. While most lesions are detected in the first 3 years, in some cases they may not be noticed until later years. Delay in diagnosis increases the risk of reinfections, airway obstruction, and intracranial complications. The authors present a 34-year-old patient with a broad nasal dermoid cyst who had previously undergone external rhinoplasty for a nasal dermoid cyst but relapsed after 5 months.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^1169jQAG]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The suprahyoid neck is frequently the site of many common conditions. Although accessible to clinical examination, some components are better evaluated with imaging; lesions occupying the sublingual and submandibular spaces are invisible to the referring clinician. A broad array of pathological processes can occur in these spaces, and pinpointing the origin can narrow the differential and, in certain cases, determine the diagnosis. These lesions can be classified into congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, and neoplastic processes. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for evaluation, but there may be cases where both are needed in conjunction. This review article discusses the relevant anatomy, clinical highlights, and the characteristic imaging features of the various pathologies that occur within the sublingual and submandibular spaces.

### Novel technique for management of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses [^111pNKcd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Definitive methods for the treatment of a Bartholin cyst and abscess include placement of a Word catheter, marsupialization, application of silver nitrate, and surgical excision. Placement of a Word catheter is the most frequently employed technique for office and emergency department (ED) management. However, many institutions do not have the Word catheter available; in addition, the catheter has a tendency to dislodge before epithelialization, leading to recurrence of the cyst.

- **Objective**: We have developed a simple technique for management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst using readily available materials. This technique involves using a small loop of plastic tubing, which is secured to prevent expulsion before epithelialization of a drainage tract.

- **Case report**: A 25-year-old woman presented to the ED with a Bartholin gland abscess. After administration of local anesthetic, a loop of tubing was placed, allowing for drainage of the abscess. The patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics. At a 3-week follow-up, the Bartholin gland abscess was found to be healed; the device was removed without difficulty, leaving two drainage tracts.

- **Conclusion**: This technique may be used as an alternative to the placement of a Word catheter for management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst.

### Infected mesenteric cyst [^116y1SwQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A mesenteric cyst is a rare condition, and its presentation with a non-typhoid spontaneous infection in an unusual location makes it even rarer. Diagnosis primarily relies on imaging modalities. However, diagnosing becomes difficult when the cyst is in an uncommon area, compounded by rare complications. A mesenteric cyst can present with several uncommon emergency conditions, which pose challenges for both diagnosis and treatment, as highlighted in this case.

### Surgical treatment of glandular odontogenic cysts [^112axVbE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Glandular odontogenic cyst (GOC) is an unusual entity of the jaws, which shows features that overlap with botryoid odontogenic cyst and mucoepidermoid tumor. GOC has an uncertain histogenesis and was recently listed by the World Health Organization as a developmental odontogenic epithelial cyst. It is characterized by an epithelial lining with cuboidal or columnar cells, both at the surface and lining, with crypts or cyst-like spaces within the thickness of the epithelium. The radiographic appearance of GOC varies and is not pathognomonic.

Several methods of treatment for GOC, including curettage, enucleation, and en bloc excision, have been used. The recurrence rate of GOC described in the literature varies between 21% and 55% according to the different treatment options. We report two patients with GOC, describe their clinicopathologic aspects, and discuss the treatment modalities in relation to two different clinical situations.

### Spinal extradural meningeal cyst: Correct radiological and histopathological diagnosis [^114DDXav]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal extradural meningeal cysts are uncommon and rarely cause neural compression. The clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics of these lesions are discussed, and previous reports are reviewed.

- **Methods**: The authors describe five cases of spinal extradural meningeal cysts in three female and two male patients, with a mean age of 47 years (range 14–75 years). Four of the cysts were located at the thoracolumbar level, and the fifth at the sacral level. Radiological and neuroimaging-based diagnosis was made using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, myelography, and/or computerized tomography (CT) myelography. A connection between the spinal subarachnoid space and the cyst cavity was demonstrated on myelography and/or CT myelography in all cases, and dural defects were confirmed visually intraoperatively. In all cases, histopathological examination confirmed that the cyst wall was formed by nonspecific fibrous connective tissue without a single-cell layer of inner arachnoid lining.

- **Conclusions**: A diagnosis of spinal extradural meningeal cyst is difficult to make based solely on histopathological examination. It is essential that the final characterization and diagnosis be based on intraoperative inspection combined with radiological and histopathological findings.

### Bartholin duct cyst and gland abscess: Office management [^11365H2N]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

The Bartholin glands, located at the base of the labia minora, play a role in vaginal lubrication. The presence of other glands means that the removal of a Bartholin gland does not affect lubrication. Ductal blockage of these typically pea-sized structures can result in gland enlargement and the subsequent development of Bartholin duct cysts or gland abscesses.

Two percent of women will develop a cyst or an abscess in their lifetime, and physicians should be familiar with the range of treatment options. Bartholin duct cysts and gland abscesses are conditions that can be managed in the office setting. The healing and recurrence rates are similar among treatment options such as fistulization, marsupialization, and silver nitrate and alcohol sclerotherapy. However, needle aspiration and incision and drainage, although the simplest procedures, are not recommended due to the relatively increased recurrence rate.

### Allergic fungal sinusitis is a histopathologic diagnosis; paranasal mucocele is not [^114Wurju]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic fungal sinusitis has been known to pathologists for two decades. During this time, multiple articles have stressed that the condition continues to be underdiagnosed. This is true, but it can also be overdiagnosed, meaning that series of cases used for clinical studies are often "contaminated" with misdiagnosed cases. As the condition can be quite problematic to control, determining the best treatment regimens is important. This depends on clinical studies that include only correctly diagnosed cases. This article discusses the steps toward making the correct diagnosis.

### Pancreatic cysts: Controversies, advances, diagnoses, and therapies [^115yDfPx]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are commonly found on cross-sectional imaging. The question arises in determining which lesions are premalignant or malignant and may require further testing, intervention, or follow-up. In pancreatic cysts without obvious malignancy on imaging, we approach them using the Four "S" Criteria: (1) symptoms that may be originating from the pancreatic cyst; (2) size of the cyst 2 cm or larger and/or main pancreatic duct greater than 5 mm; (3) survival of the patient, based on comorbidity index to determine surgical fitness; and (4) the presence of a solid component in the cyst, such as a nodule or thick walls, determined via endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (FNA).

Cyst fluid analysis options include the use of cytology to determine the presence of malignancy, as well as carcinoembryonic antigen and fluid genetics to identify potentially premalignant lesions. The aims of this article are to explore management guidelines for pancreatic cysts, present a comprehensive approach to pancreatic cysts, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of each option for evaluating pancreatic cysts, including endoscopic ultrasound with FNA and cyst fluid analysis using an evidence-based approach.

### Lesions of the Bartholin gland: A review [^112mtGHU]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Most lesions of the Bartholin gland are cysts or abscesses. Clinicians are taught that lesions of the Bartholin gland occurring in older women should raise the differential diagnosis of malignancy, although these are uncommon. A variety of more unusual and rare lesions of the Bartholin gland have been reported. This review focuses on these less common entities, which must be considered as well when encountering pathology of the Bartholin gland.

### An unusual presentation of a lingual dermoid cyst [^113JwMbt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts are rare lesions of the head and neck that typically present in children as an asymptomatic, slowly growing mass. However, this case demonstrates that dermoid cysts can present later in life as an acute infection. Our patient was a 48-year-old man with a 22-year history of recurrent abscesses of the tongue and floor of the mouth, which had required a tracheotomy and multiple hospitalizations. Magnetic resonance imaging performed between acute episodes revealed the presence of a 1.8-cm lesion within the tongue musculature. The patient underwent resection, and pathology was consistent with a lingual dermoid cyst. At 2 years of follow-up, he experienced no recurrence of symptoms.

### Laryngopyocoele in an adult female mimicking an infected branchial cyst [^1142uMPS]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of laryngopyocoele is very unusual, with only 41 cases documented in the world literature. Although hoarseness and stridor are the predominant symptoms associated with laryngocoele, a patient can present with a neck abscess misleading to an infected branchial cyst. Complete excision of the cyst can be effectively achieved by the transcervical approach, especially in the case of a large lateral cyst in a stable patient.

### An asymptomatic draining lesion on the cheek [^116zfhPm]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the most common alternative cause of a patent cutaneous fistula of dental origin?
	- A. Epidermal cyst
	- B. Tuberculosis
	- C. Thyroglossal duct
	- D. Actinomycosis
	- E. Gumma of tertiary syphilis

- **Answers**:
	- A. **Epidermal cyst** – Incorrect. Epidermal cysts are slow-growing, painless masses that elevate the skin and often have a central punctum that represents the plugged orifice at the pilosebaceous follicle. If the lining of the cyst is ruptured, keratin can spill out and create a granulomatous foreign body reaction.
	- B. **Tuberculosis** – Incorrect. Cutaneous tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, accounts for 2% to 3% of all tuberculosis cases. It evolves into an ulceration with the formation of an abscess, and a fistula can form spontaneously from the abscess, which will exude creamy pus.
	- C. **Thyroglossal duct** – Incorrect. Thyroglossal duct is the most common developmental cyst in the neck but is a rare phenomenon. The cyst moves upward with swallowing or when the tongue is extruded and may burst to form a mucus-draining sinus, which opens below the hyoid bone in the midline of the neck.
	- D. **Actinomycosis** – Correct. Actinomycosis is a subacute-to-chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces israelii that induces both suppurative and granulomatous inflammation. Localized swelling with draining sinuses and abscess formation characterize this disease, which spreads contiguously; infections of the oral and cervicofacial region commonly occur.
	- E. **Gumma of tertiary syphilis** – Incorrect. Gummas of tertiary syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, tend to arise on

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^11627VyK]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The EASL 2022 guidelines for diagnostic investigations of hepatic cysts, particularly regarding the evaluation of mucinous cystic neoplasms, recommend against obtaining tumor markers CEA or CA 19–9 in blood or cyst fluid. These markers are not recommended for discriminating between hepatic cysts and mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver.

### Glandular odontogenic cyst: A rare entity revealed and a review of the literature [^114uLywQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A glandular odontogenic cyst (GOC) is a developmental cyst that is a clinically rare and histopathologically unusual type of odontogenic cyst. GOCs are now relatively well-known entities; their importance relates to the fact that they exhibit a propensity for recurrence rates from 21% to 55%, similar to odontogenic keratocysts, and may be confused microscopically with central mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Furthermore, some microscopic features of GOCs may also be found in dentigerous, botryoid, radicular, and surgical ciliated cysts. The present case report aims to describe a typical case of GOC, highlighting its epidemiology and origin, as well as its clinical, radiographic, and microscopic features, which may be helpful for diagnosis in problematic cases, long-term follow-up, and to determine the most appropriate treatment.

### Cervicofacial actinomycosis mimicking sebaceous cyst [^112xM5He]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare, torpid, suppurative, and chronic granulomatous infection caused by a Gram-positive organism that was initially thought to be a fungus. These organisms normally live as commensals in the human oral cavity, respiratory, and digestive tracts but become invasive when they gain access to the subcutaneous tissue through a mucosal lesion. The triggering events include dental caries, dental manipulation, and maxillofacial trauma. It is often misdiagnosed as it can mimic numerous infectious and non-infectious diseases.

We describe an interesting case of cervical actinomycosis that was misdiagnosed as a sebaceous cyst and precisely identified after histopathological examination of the tissue.

### Unusual changing CT and MR appearance of an epithelial intracranial cyst [^115LNCc5]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Epithelial cysts are infrequent intracranial lesions and may contain cilia and mucosecretant cells, which can be responsible for the protein concentration within the contents and the variable radiological appearance on CT and MRI.

- **Methods and patients**: We present a case of an extraaxial epithelial cyst with changing CT and MR characteristics.

- **Results**: The appearance of our cyst on CT or MRI changed with size and morphology. When CT studies showed a hypodense cyst, the lesion was large, but when a hyperdense mass was present, the lesion was smaller. In the latter situation, MRI showed hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and hypointensity on T2-weighted images, and the protein concentration of the cystic contents was high.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that a relatively high protein concentration in our cyst was the major factor for the high attenuation on CT and the hyperintensity or hypointensity on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. We believe that these atypical imaging findings were caused by changes in the protein concentration within the cyst.

### Endoscopic management of liver abscesses and cysts that communicate with intrahepatic bile ducts [^117Gcebp]. Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

The formation of a communication between liver abscesses or cysts and intrahepatic bile ducts is an uncommon cause of significant bile leak. Surgical management of biliary fistulas is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We performed a prospective study of endoscopic management of this type of biliary fistula.

- **Patients and methods**: We studied 26 patients who had either liver abscesses or hepatic cysts that had ruptured into the intrahepatic bile ducts. The presence of a biliary fistula was suspected by jaundice and/or by the appearance of bile in percutaneous drainage effluent from a liver abscess and was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Once the route of the fistula between the liver abscess or cyst and the intrahepatic bile duct had been defined by cholangiography, patients underwent treatment by sphincterotomy and either biliary stenting or nasobiliary drainage. Nasobiliary drains or biliary stents (both 7 Fr) were placed according to standard techniques. Nasobiliary drains were removed when bile leakage stopped and closure of the fistula was confirmed by cholangiography; stents were removed after an interval of 4–6 weeks.

- **Results**: Of a total of 525 patients with hepatic abscesses or cysts who were seen over a 5-year period, there were 26 patients who developed a demonstrable communication between liver abscesses (n = 20; 16 amebic, four pyogenic) or hydatid cysts (n = 6) and intrahepatic bile ducts (right intrahepatic bile ducts in 22 patients, left intrahepatic bile ducts in four patients).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatic cysts, more specifically in the evaluation of cyst infection, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend considering the following radiological findings for identifying hepatic cyst infection:

- **Ultrasound**: Debris with a thick wall and/or distal acoustic enhancement in at least one cyst.
- **CT/MRI**: Enhanced wall thickening and/or perilesional inflammation in at least one cyst.
- **MRI**: High signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images, fluid-fluid level, wall thickening, or gas in at least one cyst.
- **18-FDG PET-CT**: Increased FDG activity lining a cyst compared to normal parenchyma.

### Complete recovery of acute monocular visual loss following endoscopic resection of anterior clinoid mucocele: Case report and review of the literature [^116MjJJ1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Mucoceles are chronic non-neoplastic cystic lesions lined by mucus-secreting respiratory epithelium in the paranasal sinuses. Mucocele of the anterior clinoid process is a particularly rare entity, most often presenting with rapidly progressive monocular blindness. The authors describe the case of a 32-year-old man who presented with acute painless visual loss in the left eye. Workup revealed an expansile lesion of the left anterior clinoid process with associated optic nerve compression. The patient underwent emergent endoscopic-assisted transnasal decompression of the optic nerve, resulting in full recovery of visual function. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention optimize the chances of functional regain of visual acuity.
