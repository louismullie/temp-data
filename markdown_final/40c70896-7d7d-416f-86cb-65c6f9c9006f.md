precise pathway

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to define what constitutes a "precise pathway" across biological, clinical, and systems levels, and to show how to operationalize it for precision medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the term "precise pathway" and distinguishing molecular pathways from clinical care pathways. Then, I should verify the core principles that make a pathway "precise" in each domain. Next, I will examine concrete examples and methods that instantiate these principles, followed by a stepwise operational framework. Finally, I need to check limitations, pitfalls, and how to validate and implement these concepts in practice, ensuring the reasoning remains clinically grounded and reference-supported throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate domains. In biology, a pathway is a set of interconnected molecular interactions that transmit signals or execute cellular programs, whereas in clinical practice, a pathway is a structured, decision-oriented workflow that standardizes care while preserving clinician judgment; both can be made "precise", but the meaning differs by context, so I need to keep these parallel tracks explicit in the reasoning [^116cAUrd] [^112YGUax].

> Now, I will define what makes a biological pathway "precise". Mechanistic specificity means the pathway's nodes and edges are experimentally validated and context-aware, not just inferred from correlation; quantifiability means we can measure pathway activity with biomarkers or signatures; and clinical actionability means the pathway's dysregulation can be linked to a therapeutic target or diagnostic stratification, ideally with temporal and spatial resolution relevant to disease stage and tissue [^111iQqbr] [^112C7vtQ] [^114NhURw].

> Hold on, let me verify examples that meet these criteria. The amyloid-beta pathway in Alzheimer's disease demonstrates mechanistic specificity with genetic and biomarker evidence of initiation decades before symptoms, enabling stage-specific interventions; the TGF-β signaling axis shows therapeutic tractability across fibrosis, cancer, and autoimmunity; and ubiquitination pathways illustrate how precise knowledge of post-translational control yields actionable drug targets across multiple diseases [^114NhURw] [^114bgK1w] [^117AXyRR].

> Next, I should review what makes a clinical care pathway "precise". A precise clinical pathway is decision-anchored, translating evidence into branching algorithms; it is patient-centered, integrating comorbidities, preferences, and goals; and it is dynamically updatable as new evidence emerges, with explicit shared decision-making prompts and implementation tools [^112YGUax] [^114g5nzF] [^1113LseA].

> Wait, let me verify exemplars of precise clinical pathways. ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways operationalize complex choices such as nonstatin LDL-lowering, HFpEF/HFrEF management, and myocarditis staging into stepwise, reference-aware algorithms; AGA NAFLD pathways embed risk stratification and multidisciplinary care; and fibromyalgia DTCPs integrate diagnostic and therapeutic steps across settings, illustrating how standardization can coexist with individualized care [^111ikcY7] [^112Ud1Ri] [^1111NMMw] [^115RJbX3] [^1126AaMa] [^111tKsUY].

> I will now examine methods that operationalize biological pathway precision. Knowledge bases like Reactome provide curated, mechanistic representations; network medicine approaches map disease modules and cross-disease relationships; and single-cell and context-aware tools such as MAYA quantify pathway activity in cell-type–specific modes, while unbiased discovery frameworks like PET/Benchmark and integrative models such as SIMMS identify dysregulated subnetworks that can serve as biomarkers or targets [^116cAUrd] [^114UDdt3] [^113P7sQj] [^112GjDk4] [^112NE2Sg].

> But wait, what if we overfit to canonical pathways and miss disease-specific wiring? I should double-check that tissue- and disease-specific context is incorporated. Approaches that filter interactions by evolutionary selection patterns or integrate regulatory and physical interactomes improve cancer-specific pathway inference; rare disease network analyses reveal how genotype propagates through multi-scale biological organization, informing cross-disease generalization and patient-specific interpretation [^1115aksF] [^111PqnMv].

> Let me consider how to translate this into a clinical operational framework. First, define the clinical question and scope with stakeholder input; second, assemble and appraise evidence to anchor decisions; third, map decision nodes into an algorithm with explicit branches; fourth, build implementation tools and visuals; fifth, embed shared decision-making prompts; sixth, pilot, evaluate, and iterate based on outcomes and new evidence, aligning with ACC methodology for ECDPs [^114FME3X] [^117LwMmm] [^1113LseA].

> Hold on, I should verify that this framework respects complexity and avoids false precision. Diseases like IBD, psoriasis, and asthma demonstrate molecular heterogeneity that necessitates endotype-driven strategies; rare diseases often reveal mechanistic "shortcuts" that can be leveraged for common diseases; and multimorbidity requires prioritizing therapies with cross-condition benefit, acknowledging uncertainty and patient preferences [^113bcPLT] [^112e8Zbk] [^111akFfW] [^113zoKTh] [^114JTyov].

> I need to ensure we address limitations and validation. Pathway analysis can be biased by gene set size, annotation quality, and tissue context; single-gene or single-pathway views may miss network effects; and clinical pathways risk rigidity without iterative updates. Robust benchmarking, replication across cohorts, integration of orthogonal data, and linkage to outcomes are essential to substantiate claims of precision [^112GjDk4] [^1118ptU3] [^111iQqbr].

> Let me reconsider the overarching synthesis to ensure coherence. A precise pathway, whether molecular or clinical, is one that is context-specific, evidence-anchored, measurable, and actionable, enabling clinicians to match mechanism to therapy and to navigate complexity with transparent, updatable decision logic; this is the bridge from bench to bedside that precision medicine promises, and it requires continuous validation and patient-centered design to be clinically meaningful [^111iQqbr] [^112YGUax] [^114g5nzF].

The precise pathway is the **sequence of molecular events** from a specific stimulus to a defined cellular response, with each step experimentally validated and mechanistically linked. It emphasizes **causal relationships**, temporal ordering, and spatial localization, enabling accurate prediction and therapeutic targeting [^116o2tGh]. Precise pathways are essential for **precision medicine**, biomarker discovery, and drug development, and are supported by curated databases such as Reactome and KEGG [^116cAUrd] [^112z1QR2].

---

## Definition and characteristics

A precise pathway is defined by the following **key characteristics**:

- **Causal relationships**: Each step in the pathway is causally linked to the next, ensuring a clear mechanistic flow from stimulus to response [^116SfHQt].

- **Temporal ordering**: The sequence of events is temporally ordered, reflecting the actual progression of molecular interactions [^114NhURw].

- **Spatial localization**: Pathways specify the cellular compartments and anatomical locations where interactions occur, providing spatial context [^116SfHQt].

- **Experimental validation**: Each step is supported by experimental evidence, ensuring accuracy and reliability [^116cAUrd].

## Examples of precise pathways

Several well-characterized pathways exemplify the concept of **precise pathways**:

| **Pathway** | **Description** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Amyloid-beta pathway | Sequence of events leading to amyloid-beta aggregation and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease | Central to Alzheimer's pathogenesis; therapeutic target for disease modification [^114NhURw] |
| TGF-β signaling pathway | Regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; implicated in fibrosis, cancer, and immune regulation | Therapeutic target for fibrosis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases [^114bgK1w] |
| Ubiquitination pathway | Post-translational modification regulating protein degradation and signaling | Target for cancer therapy and protein homeostasis disorders [^117AXyRR] |

---

## Methods for elucidating precise pathways

Advances in molecular biology and computational biology have enabled the **elucidation of precise pathways** through:

- **High-throughput omics technologies**: Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics provide comprehensive data on molecular interactions [^notfound].

- **Network medicine**: Integrative approaches that map molecular interactions into networks, revealing pathway architectures and functional modules [^114UDdt3].

- **Curated databases**: Resources such as Reactome and KEGG provide manually curated, experimentally validated pathway information [^116cAUrd] [^116o2tGh].

---

## Clinical implications

Precise pathways have significant **clinical implications**:

- **Precision medicine**: Enables targeted therapies tailored to specific molecular defects, improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects [^112e8Zbk].

- **Biomarker discovery**: Identification of pathway-specific biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of disease progression [^111ZfvzP].

- **Drug development**: Facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of pathway-specific drugs [^111tqSnG].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite significant advances, several **challenges remain** in defining precise pathways:

- **Complexity and redundancy**: Biological systems exhibit redundancy and compensatory mechanisms, complicating pathway delineation [^116snLcu].

- **Context dependence**: Pathway activity is influenced by cellular context, environmental factors, and genetic variability [^113P7sQj].

- **Technological limitations**: Current methods may not fully capture the dynamic nature of molecular interactions [^116SfHQt].

---

## Future directions

Future research should focus on **integrating multi-omics data** to build comprehensive, context-aware pathway models [^111iQqbr]. Developing dynamic models that capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of pathway activity will improve mechanistic understanding [^114NhURw]. Translational efforts must bridge the gap between pathway discovery and clinical application, ensuring that precise pathways inform patient care [^112DWi2z].

The precise pathway is a **sequence of molecular events** from a specific stimulus to a defined cellular response, with each step experimentally validated and mechanistically linked. It emphasizes causal relationships, temporal ordering, and spatial localization, enabling accurate prediction and therapeutic targeting. Precise pathways are essential for precision medicine, biomarker discovery, and drug development, and are supported by curated databases such as Reactome and KEGG [^116cAUrd] [^116o2tGh].

### Signal transduction for clinicians: why should we care? [^1116JXBG]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Neurons must respond to a bewildering array of external and internal stimuli and must distinguish among them to generate an appropriate response or change in metabolic or electrical activity. Furthermore, the response of a cell to a given stimulus must depend on what else is happening inside and outside the cell at the time of arrival of that stimulus. The process of signal transduction is what gives the cell and organism the flexibility and "knowledge base" to carry out these functions. Conversely, aberrations of signal transduction underlie an increasing array of developmental, genetic, and acquired diseases and conditions of the nervous system. Pharmacological modulation of signal transduction pathways and their effectors holds great promise for the remediation of these neurologic disorders.

Terminology

The broad lexicon of "precision" medicine includes many overlapping and somewhat confusing terms (Table 1). Initially, the terms "individualized medicine" and "personalized medicine" were used. However, as researchers sought specific biologic pathways, they recognized that such pathways might apply to a group of patients, and not necessarily to a single or unique individual. Hence, at least in the near future, the goal is not necessarily to generate a unique treatment for every individual or person, but, rather, tailored treatments for groups with tightly grouped biologic features. These groups, in turn, need a name.

Table 1
Key terms in precision medicine

Strata, phenotypes, endotypes, subphenotypes, and subtypes

Some use the term "stratified" medicine instead of precision medicine, and advance the idea that groups are "strata". Others borrow from genomic medicine and use the term "phenotype" to describe a group or cluster of patients, albeit more broadly than in its original framing. The original use of phenotype would include the entire clinical expression of a condition, including its trajectory and outcome. For example, the phenotype for some severe genetic mutations is intrauterine death. But phenotype in the lexicon of precision medicine can be used quite differently. For example, a clinical trialist typically uses the term phenotype to describe a set of presenting features that could be used as criteria for enrollment into an experimental study. In this example, the subsequent trajectory and outcome are not part of the definition of phenotype. Neither use is wrong, but it is key that researchers are explicit in delineating whether phenotype is restricted to presenting features, and if so at what time point, or not.

If a group of patients look similar (share a presenting phenotype) but have subclinical differences (e.g. two different gene expression patterns or metabolic profiles), then they might be further divided into "endotypes". Thus, a particular phenotype may be expressed by two endotypes. However, endotype in its strictest sense implies an understanding of the exact mechanism of disease, or at least the mechanistic relationship between the molecular signature defining the endotype and the disease in question. In reality, researchers may often be able to associate particular patterns of gene expression or biomarker profiles with disease characteristics, but fall short of proof of mechanism and causality. Thus, the term "endotype" may be used rather loosely, prompting others to prefer the term "subphenotype" (or "subtype").

### The importance of international collaboration for rare diseases research: a European perspective [^113zoKTh]. Gene Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A rare disease (RD) is defined as such by the fact that it affects a small percentage of the population. However, there is no internationally recognized definition of a RD. In the European Union (EU), a disease is defined as rare when it is life-threatening or chronically debilitating and when no more than 1 in 2000 people has it. In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002defines a RD strictly according to prevalence, specifically 'any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200 000 people in the United States', or ~1 in 1500 people. In Japan, the legal definition of a RD is one that affects fewer than 50 000 patients in Japan, or ~1 in 2500 people. However, while individually these diseases may be considered rare, collectively they are not. It is estimated that 8% of people have one of the 6000–8000 RDs, and ~36 million Europeans are affected by one or will be. Eighty per cent of RDs are genetic in origin and often result from a dysfunction of a particular pathway (such as a defective gene or protein). Thus, understanding the impact of a single defect can yield insights into more complex pathways and, as result, RDs can serve as models for more common conditions, in particular in the context of precision medicine.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with multi-system manifestations including arthritis and obesity. Our knowledge of the aetiology of the condition, including the key genomic, immune and environmental factors, has led to the development of targeted, precision therapies that alleviate patient morbidity. This article reviews the key pathophysiological pathways and therapeutic targets and highlights future areas of interest in psoriasis research.

### Pathway-based subnetworks enable cross-disease biomarker discovery [^112NE2Sg]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Precision molecular medicine is predicated on the concept of giving each patient the right drug in the right dose at the right time. This type of personalized treatment requires the development of robust biomarkers that precisely predict clinical phenotypes. Current clinical biomarkers are typically derived from a small number of genes, and do not yet recapitulate the full complexity of disease. SIMMS takes a step towards integrating diverse cellular processes into a singular model, and is well-positioned to take into account the influx of clinical sequencing data now being generated. However, as -omic techniques evolve to rapidly analyze and quantify cellular metabolites, network models may need to change from being gene-centric to including metabolites as core nodes. Further, single-cell analysis methods may allow accurate interrogation of the interactions between different cell-types, perhaps requiring simultaneous fitting of multiple distinct, but interacting network models. The continued development of robust, general biomarker discovery algorithms is thus required to generate the accurate and reproducible biomarkers needed for transforming medical care.

### Functional genomics in autoimmune diseases [^116RsLYN]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Associations between genetic loci and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease have been well characterized, however, translating this knowledge into mechanistic insight and patient benefit remains a challenge. While improvements in the precision, completeness and accuracy of our genetic understanding of autoimmune diseases will undoubtedly be helpful, meeting this challenge will require two interlinked problems to be addressed: first which of the highly correlated variants at an individual locus is responsible for increased disease risk, and second what are the downstream effects of this variant. Given that the majority of loci are thought to affect non-coding regulatory elements, the second question is often reframed as what are the target gene(s) and pathways affected by causal variants. Currently, these questions are being addressed using a wide variety of novel techniques and datasets. In many cases, these approaches are complementary and it is likely that the most accurate picture will be generated by consolidating information relating to transcription, regulatory activity, chromatin accessibility, chromatin conformation and readouts from functional experiments, such as genome editing and reporter assays. It is clear that it will be necessary to gather this information from disease relevant cell types and conditions and that by doing so our understanding of disease etiology will be improved. This review is focused on the field of autoimmune disease functional genomics with a particular focus on the most exciting and significant research to be published within the last couple of years.

### Network medicine: a network-based approach to human disease [^114UDdt3]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.

### Pathway paradigms revealed from the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease [^113bcPLT]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex genetic disease that is instigated and amplified by the confluence of multiple genetic and environmental variables that perturb the immune-microbiome axis. The challenge of dissecting pathological mechanisms underlying IBD has led to the development of transformative approaches in human genetics and functional genomics. Here we describe IBD as a model disease in the context of leveraging human genetics to dissect interactions in cellular and molecular pathways that regulate homeostasis of the mucosal immune system. Finally, we synthesize emerging insights from multiple experimental approaches into pathway paradigms and discuss future prospects for disease-subtype classification and therapeutic intervention.

Conclusions

Over the recent decades, translational and multi-disciplinary studies — from (epi)genetic, to biological, and to biomarker-based clinical investigations — have contributed to unveiling the biochemical, physiological, and pathophysiological features of the Aβ pathway, including its spatial and temporal dynamics throughout the AD continuum. All point to the Aβ pathway as a hallmark of disease pathophysiology rather than a passive readout of the disease process. As discussed above, anatomical and biomarker-based studies of familial and sporadic AD provide critical genetic and molecular evidence about the initiation of the Aβ pathway decades before the onset of the symptoms and upstream to other pathophysiological hallmarks of AD.

These advances in biology have culminated in the identification of tangible therapeutic molecular targets for AD in order to slow disease progression at the earliest possible clinical and preclinical stages. Progress in drug R&D has also been accelerated by the validation of Aβ biomarkers-based outcomes and endpoints and for different context(s)-of-use, including patient diagnosis for clinical trials, target engagement of drug candidates, and proof-of-mechanism. Implementation of biomarker-guided pipelines contributes to explaining why the first generation of compounds targeting Aβ aggregation species and with putative disease-modifying effect reached late-stage development and exhibited phase II and phase III failures. However, the field needs to fully uncover the physiological functions of the Aβ pathway, as well as the upstream molecular orchestrators of its dyshomeostasis in AD. Aβ homeostasis undergoes a complex interplay consisting of highly conserved feedback loops and interactions among an array of quality control mechanisms and protein clearance pathways across cells, tissues, and body systems. Understanding this hierarchical organization across tissues and body systems and its decline with aging and in an individual, genetically determined fashion will be essential to comprehensively target the Aβ cycle for preventive strategies. New multi-modal imaging integrative approaches coupled with molecular imaging and fluid biomarkers hold the potential to unravel the spatial and temporal coordinates the Aβ pathways dynamics and to map the critical genetic and biological factors influencing sub-population clinical and pathophysiological trajectories.

Within this conceptual framework, Aβ-oriented therapies will be more and more scaled to the disease stage and biological inter-individual differences for time-sensitive and effective pathway (a mechanism)-based preventive strategies for AD, aligned with the precision medicine paradigm.

### Advancing precision medicine in inflammatory skin disease [^117XxzGn]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to Precision Medicine for Inflammatory Skin Disease

Medications inhibiting specific inflammatory pathways are now so commonly prescribed to treat chronic skin conditions that precisely matching drug to disease presentations is deterministic in patient outcomes. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted immunomodulatory therapies, treatment selection remains largely empirical. Within well-defined disease categories, molecular heterogeneity leads to varying drug responses. In other cases, overlapping clinicopathologic features complicate diagnosis and medication selection. As a result, therapeutic decisions are often shaped more by trial-and-error and insurance constraints than by underlying biology. This disconnect between disease heterogeneity and therapeutic strategy not only undermines clinical outcomes, it also contributes to escalating costs, as biologic medications represent a substantial share of prescription drug expenditures.

Precision medicine offers a framework to address these challenges by tailoring diagnosis and treatment to the key molecular features of each patient's disease. We identify three clinical contexts where such approaches can be transformative. First, overlapping features of distinct conditions (such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) complicate diagnosis in some cases and increase the risk of erroneous drug selection (Fig. 1 A). Second, as in most cases where the diagnosis is clear (e.g. psoriasis), therapeutic response varies. While many patients with psoriasis respond to either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, a subset responds to neither. Identifying these individuals in advance could avoid delays in effective care (Fig. 1 B). Finally, for clinical presentations lacking a clear diagnosis or diseases without a defined mechanism, molecular testing can provide partial yet actionable insight into disease presentations whose etiology is unclear. In such unusual cases, a growing number of existing targeted treatments can be redirected to inhibit the candidate abnormality (Fig. 1 C).

### Signaling is the pathway to macrophage function [^112TMSV3]. Trends in Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tissue and inflammatory contexts are well appreciated to shape macrophage function to promote health or disease. However, there has been minimal progress towards understanding how these contexts modify signaling-to-transcription networks. Integration of mechanistic modeling and data-driven approaches will be crucial for investigating how cell state impacts macrophage decision-making.

### Emerging systemic treatments for asthma and allergic diseases: new tricks, same dog? [^111akFfW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma and allergic diseases are heterogeneous conditions driven by complex immunological pathways, with type 2 (T2) inflammation being a key but not exclusive component. Advances in immunology have spurred interest in a breadth of mechanisms and innovative therapeutic strategies, including novel targets, extended dosing intervals, and combined-target therapies. This clinical commentary provides a critical overview of ongoing clinical trials and emerging evidence supporting the use of these therapies in asthma and other allergic conditions. We evaluate and summarize emerging systemic treatments across four mechanistic categories: T2 cytokine inhibitors, alarmin blockers, effector cell modulators, and therapies targeting unconventional, broad immune, and non-T2 inflammation pathways. For each category, we present balanced perspectives on therapeutic potential and limitations. While certain therapies demonstrate promise, particularly in T2-high phenotypes, challenges remain in identifying predictive biomarkers, understanding long-term safety, and addressing non-T2 mechanisms. The commentary concludes with outcomes measurement recommendations and outlines urgent knowledge gaps requiring targeted research to optimize precision treatment strategies for diverse patient populations with asthma and allergic diseases.

### Pre-pandemic disease trajectories and genetic insights into long COVID susceptibility [^1175Q3Uy]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long COVID is the persistence of symptoms or sequelae after the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its prevalence is estimated to be between 10 and 30% in mild COVID-19 cases, 50 and 70% in severe cases and 10 and 12% in individuals vaccinated prior to infection, as reviewed by Davis et al. Long COVID has been associated with female sex, middle age, lower educational attainment and COVID severity. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as depression and anxiety, have also been identified as risk factors.

While multiple studies have confirmed prior conditions as risk factors for long COVID, the impact of sequential combinations of chronic diseases remains unexplored. It is well established that chronic diseases impact differently when occurring in isolation versus in combination with other conditions, a phenomenon known as multimorbidity. Co-occurrence leads to increased disease severity, higher healthcare utilisation, reduced quality of life and elevated mortality. Likewise, this sequence co-occurrence is not random, as the presence of a particular disease in an individual modifies the risk of suffering a second condition. This is particularly relevant in older age, where multimorbidity is shaped by specific conditions, named root diseases and shared genetic factors that may act as a catalyst for the development of multiple coexisting disorders. Chronic diseases occurring in a specific order or pattern, referred to as disease trajectories, could help uncover disease mechanisms and improve patient prediction and classification.

Long COVID is a heterogeneous condition comprising distinct subtypes with varying symptom profiles and differing impacts on quality of life. Identifying these differential mechanisms may be crucial for preventing worse outcomes and improving prognosis. While chronic disease burden has been described as a risk factor, we hypothesise that specific temporal sequences of disease may uncover shared biological pathways and common genetic susceptibilities, contributing to a more precise characterisation of long COVID risk trajectories. Moreover, COVID-19 itself, through severity, is a known determinant of long COVID, yet the role of pre-existing conditions may also act independently or through severity pathways. Understanding these distinct contributions remains a key challenge.

In this study, we examine the impact of disease trajectories preceding the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of long COVID and its associated symptoms. Additionally, we investigate shared genetic risk factors underlying multimorbidity and genetic susceptibility to long COVID.

### Delivering paediatric precision medicine: genomic and environmental considerations along the causal pathway of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders [^111G9jLX]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine refers to treatments that are targeted to an individual's unique characteristics. Precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders (such as cerebral palsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder) in children has predominantly focused on advances in genomic sequencing technologies to increase our ability to identify single gene mutations, diagnose a multitude of rare neurodevelopmental disorders, and gain insights into pathogenesis. Although targeting specific gene variants with high penetrance will help some children with rare disease, this approach will not help most children with neurodevelopmental disorders. A 'pathway' driven approach targeting the cumulative influence of psychosocial, epigenetic, or cellular factors is likely to be more effective. To optimize the therapeutic potential of precision medicine, we present a biopsychosocial integrated framework to examine the 'gene-environment neuroscience interaction'. Such an approach would be supported through harnessing the power of big data, transdiagnostic assessment, impact and implementation evaluation, and a bench-to-bedside scientific discovery agenda with ongoing clinician and patient engagement. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Precision medicine has predominantly focused on genetic risk factors. The impact of environmental risk factors, particularly inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risks, is understudied. A holistic biopsychosocial model of neurodevelopmental disorder causal pathways is presented. The model will provide precision medicine across the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Approaches and advances in the genetic causes of autoimmune disease and their implications [^115HUXSY]. Nature Immunology (2018). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association studies are transformative in revealing the polygenetic basis of common diseases, with autoimmune diseases leading the charge. Although the field is just over 10 years old, advances in understanding the underlying mechanistic pathways of these conditions, which result from a dense multifactorial blend of genetic, developmental and environmental factors, have already been informative, including insights into therapeutic possibilities. Nevertheless, the challenge of identifying the actual causal genes and pathways and their biological effects on altering disease risk remains for many identified susceptibility regions. It is this fundamental knowledge that will underpin the revolution in patient stratification, the discovery of therapeutic targets and clinical trial design in the next 20 years. Here we outline recent advances in analytical and phenotyping approaches and the emergence of large cohorts with standardized gene-expression data and other phenotypic data that are fueling a bounty of discovery and improved understanding of human physiology.

### Pathway-based subnetworks enable cross-disease biomarker discovery [^116RYZyD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most human disease is complex, caused by interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental insults. A single disease phenotype can often arise in many ways, allowing a diversity of molecular underpinnings to yield a smaller number of phenotypic consequences. This molecular heterogeneity within a single disease is believed to underlie poor clinical trial results for some therapiesand the modest performance of many genome-wide association studies –.

Researchers thus face two challenges. First, molecular markers are needed to personalize and optimize treatment decisions by predicting patient outcome (prognosis/residual risk) and response to therapy. Second, clinical heterogeneity in patient phenotypes needs to be molecularly rationalized to allow targeting of the mechanistic underpinnings of disease. For example, if a single pathway is dysregulated in multiple ways, drugs targeting the pathway could be applied.

Several approaches have been taken to solve these challenges. The most common has been to measure mRNA abundances as a snapshot of cellular state, and to construct a predictive model from them. Unfortunately, these studies have been limited by noise and disease heterogeneity. Several groups have integrated multiple data types using network and systems biology approaches identifying patient subtypes, with limited post-hoc clinical evaluation –. These algorithms have not yet clearly shown how the interplay between different pathways underpins disease etiology, nor generated biomarkers with systematically demonstrated reproducibility on independent patient cohorts across multiple indications.

There is thus an urgent need to generate accurate and actionable biomarkers that integrate diverse molecular, functional and clinical information. We developed a subnetwork-based approach, called SIMMS, which uses arbitrary molecular data types to identify dysregulated pathways and create functional biomarkers. We validate SIMMS across five tumor types and 11,392 patients, using it to create biomarkers from a diverse range of molecular assays and uncovering unanticipated pan-cancer similarities.

### Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway – A report from the American Gastroenterological Association institute HCV care pathway work group [^113D3Xgu]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation of patients with HCV states that the initial assessment of an individual infected with HCV requires clinicians to efficiently gather data to weigh the risk of disease progression against the benefit of viral eradication, and although HCV eradication is considered beneficial in virtually all infected persons a patient must be physically and mentally ready for treatment, with conditions that could compromise treatment success carefully considered; the first visit is an opportunity to assess medical conditions that may contribute to progression, risk of complications or impact the selection of treatment regimen, and physical examination and laboratory testing should be targeted to evaluate for conditions that impact treatment decisions, identify patients at risk for progression of liver fibrosis or advanced liver disease, and screen for HCV extra-hepatic manifestations, noting that some laboratory tests may be necessary to meet the requirements of the patient's health insurance provider and that Figure 5 displays the algorithm to evaluate patients for the degree of liver disease severity, including fibrosis and cirrhosis.

### Pathway and network-based strategies to translate genetic discoveries into effective therapies [^111tqSnG]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

One way to design a drug is to attempt to phenocopy a genetic variant that is known to have the desired effect. In general, drugs that are supported by genetic associations progress further in the development pipeline. However, the number of associations that are candidates for development into drugs is limited because many associations are in non-coding regions or difficult to target genes. Approaches that overlay information from pathway databases or biological networks can expand the potential target list. In cases where the initial variant is not targetable or there is no variant with the desired effect, this may reveal new means to target a disease. In this review, we discuss recent examples in the domain of pathway and network-based drug repositioning from genetic associations. We highlight important caveats and challenges for the field, and we discuss opportunities for further development.

### Network analysis reveals rare disease signatures across multiple levels of biological organization [^111PqnMv]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 2 decades, rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology allowed us to uncover the genetic basis of over 6000 rare diseases –. In contrast to common diseases, which are typically characterized by a complex interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors, rare diseases can often be pinpointed to a single genetic lesion. Rare diseases thus offer unique opportunities to mechanistically dissect the relationship between genetic aberrations and their phenotypic consequences, which can then inform targeted treatment strategies. For individual rare diseases, this potential for a molecularly rooted, personalized medicine could already be demonstrated, for example in rare immunodeficiencies –, neurodevelopmental, and metabolic disorders. At the same time, the costs and extended timelines of these individual efforts also highlight the need for novel, systematic approaches for investigating the large number of rare diseases that still remain uncharacterized. To this end, several practical and conceptual challenges need to be overcome:

First, rare disease phenomena cover a wide spectrum, from highly cell-type or organ-specific phenotypes to heterogeneous, syndromic diseases that affect the whole body. Our understanding of how a genetic aberration impacts various scales of biological organization between genotype and clinical phenotype is very limited. Second, the enormous complexity within and between different organizational scales, such as the transcriptome, proteome, intra- or intercellular communication, also poses important technical challenges: How can we identify and integrate the most relevant data? Third, the rarity of many conditions with monogenic origins implies that data are usually scarce. Traditionally, rare diseases have been studied following a one-gene, one-pathway, one-disease paradigm. A systematic approach for transferring knowledge from one rare disease to another, and for investigating differences and commonalities between different diseases, is still missing.

In this work, we propose a network-based framework for systematically investigating rare diseases that addresses these challenges, and, in turn, use the large number of rare diseases with a well-described genetic origin to deepen our understanding of disease-associated perturbations of molecular networks. Specifically, we introduce a multiplex network approach for integrating different network layers that represent different scales of biological organization ranging from the genome to the transcriptome and the phenome. A systematic characterization of the network signatures of all rare diseases with known genetic causes allowed us to identify the connectivity patterns that determine the importance of a particular scale of biological organization for a given rare disease. Finally, we explored how these systems-level insights may help contextualize individual genetic lesions, investigate the impact of disease heterogeneity, and be translated into clinically actionable tools for the genetic diagnosis of rare disease patients with unknown gene defects.

### Data science in neurodegenerative disease: its capabilities, limitations, and perspectives [^112zgARW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Knowledge-based models

Knowledge-based models have been developed in parallel to data-driven approaches to facilitate the interpretation of empirical data with background knowledge. Such models have effectively garnered novel insights into several disease areas and have also led to new disease taxonomies. By classifying diseases through data and knowledge-based models, it is possible to establish an alternative approach to the current paradigm of disease classification by clinical appearance. This can facilitate the identification of disease subtypes and associated molecular processes and thereby, help to establish potential disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.

NDDs are a particularly complex set of diseases, where short and direct causal links can be challenging to discern. However, NDDs have considerable genetic components and with an abundance of biomedical omics data generated from high-throughput technologies, several data-driven approaches can be used to gain insights on these multifaceted diseases. Nonetheless, these approaches tend to lack contextual information; for instance, the cumulative effect of several dysregulated genes with slight alterations can be greater than the effect of a single, highly altered gene. Conversely, knowledge-based models, such as pathway-centric approaches, can incorporate prior knowledge to point at relevant pathways or biological processes and possess greater explanatory power. Thus, by taking into account pathway effects, pathway-centric approaches consider a condition in its broader biological context rather than elucidating specific, individual genes or molecular processes involved in that condition. In the field of NDD research, various pathway analyses have reported significantly enriched pathways in specific NDDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as across two or more NDDs.

Though various pathway-centric approaches markedly improve the interpretive power of omics data, these approaches rely upon canonical pathways and representing disease context can be challenging. Moreover, as NDDs tend to be complex and multifaceted, they may only be partially attributable to the involvement of a given number of pathways. As such, elucidating disease-specific mechanisms may be more appropriate for NDDs as compared with applying pathway-centric approaches. Accordingly, disease-specific knowledge maps, resources which contain mechanisms that are specific to a particular disease, have been developed and can be used to build computational models of disease. Notably, the Disease Maps Project has collected disease maps for several diseases, including AlzPathway for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease map for Parkinson's disease, whereas the NeuroMMSig knowledge graph has collated candidate mechanisms for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.

### Delivering paediatric precision medicine: genomic and environmental considerations along the causal pathway of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders [^112YpHDg]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine refers to treatments that are targeted to an individual's unique characteristics. Precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders (such as cerebral palsy, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder) in children has predominantly focused on advances in genomic sequencing technologies to increase our ability to identify single gene mutations, diagnose a multitude of rare neurodevelopmental disorders, and gain insights into pathogenesis. Although targeting specific gene variants with high penetrance will help some children with rare disease, this approach will not help most children with neurodevelopmental disorders. A 'pathway' driven approach targeting the cumulative influence of psychosocial, epigenetic, or cellular factors is likely to be more effective. To optimize the therapeutic potential of precision medicine, we present a biopsychosocial integrated framework to examine the 'gene–environment neuroscience interaction'. Such an approach would be supported through harnessing the power of big data, transdiagnostic assessment, impact and implementation evaluation, and a bench‐to‐bedside scientific discovery agenda with ongoing clinician and patient engagement.

What this paper adds

Precision medicine has predominantly focused on genetic risk factors.
The impact of environmental risk factors, particularly inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risks, is understudied.
A holistic biopsychosocial model of neurodevelopmental disorder causal pathways is presented.
The model will provide precision medicine across the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Towards a pathway inventory of the human brain for modeling disease mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration [^116SfHQt]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Molecular signaling pathways have been long used to demonstrate interactions among upstream causal molecules and downstream biological effects. They show the signal flow between cell compartments, the majority of which are represented as cartoons. These are often drawn manually by scanning through the literature, which is time-consuming, static, and non-interoperable. Moreover, these pathways are often devoid of context (condition and tissue) and biased toward certain disease conditions. Mining the scientific literature creates new possibilities to retrieve pathway information at higher contextual resolution and specificity. To address this challenge, we have created a pathway terminology system by combining signaling pathways and biological events to ensure a broad coverage of the entire pathway knowledge domain. This terminology was applied to mining biomedical papers and patents about neurodegenerative diseases with focus on Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate the power of our approach by mapping literature-derived signaling pathways onto their corresponding anatomical regions in the human brain under healthy and Alzheimer's disease states. We demonstrate how this knowledge resource can be used to identify a putative mechanism explaining the mode-of-action of the approved drug Rasagiline, and show how this resource can be used for fingerprinting patents to support the discovery of pathway knowledge for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we propose that based on next-generation cause-and-effect pathway models, a dedicated inventory of computer-processable pathway models specific to neurodegenerative diseases can be established, which hopefully accelerates context-specific enrichment analysis of experimental data with higher resolution and richer annotations.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^112YGUax]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

### Classification of demyelinating diseases at the interface between etiology and pathogenesis [^116ecvyg]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The classical demyelinating diseases include the 'autoimmune' inflammatory demyelinating diseases, the inflammatory demyelinating diseases of infectious aetiology, and the demyelinating or dysmyelinating diseases of genetic/hereditary background. In addition, primary demyelination is present in other conditions, such as brain ischaemia and intoxication. Irrespective of the primary aetiology, selective demyelination can be mediated through various pathogenetic pathways: the immune-mediated inflammatory pathway; the metabolic pathway; and the ischaemic/excitotoxic pathway. These pathways are only partly segregated with distinct aetiologies of demyelinating diseases, but they also reflect the way in which the patient copes with the disease-inciting event in relation to their particular genetic background. For future therapeutic strategies it will be important to interfere with the specific pathogenetic pathways of demyelination, which may be common to various demyelinating diseases, but may differ in subgroups of patients who suffer from a particular clinical demyelinating disease entity.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic care pathway for fibromyalgia [^111tKsUY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate treatments positively influence the history of fibromyalgia syndrome (FM), with favourable repercussions at clinical, psychological, social and economic levels. Notwithstanding, there are still significant problems with timeliness of diagnosis, access to pharmacological therapies - particularly to innovative ones - and appropriate and effective taking in charge of patients. All the aforementioned factors have a great impact on FM patients' quality of life. Indeed, even though the World Health Organisation recognised FM as a chronic condition in the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10), many countries still fail to recognise the syndrome, and this negatively influences the capability to appropriately protect and care for patients. This is the case in several European Countries. In Italy, a few Regions have started to put in place precise indications for people suffering from FM, aiming at the implementation of diagnostic-therapeutic pathways. The Diagnostic-Therapeutic Care Pathway (DTCP) provides an important tool to meet the needs of patients suffering from chronic diseases. They present the organisation of an integrated assistance network. This includes a seamless path for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, by means of cooperation among physicians and other healthcare professionals.

### Decoding disease: from genomes to networks to phenotypes [^111iQqbr]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Interpreting the effects of genetic variants is key to understanding individual susceptibility to disease and designing personalized therapeutic approaches. Modern experimental technologies are enabling the generation of massive compendia of human genome sequence data and associated molecular and phenotypic traits, together with genome-scale expression, epigenomics and other functional genomic data. Integrative computational models can leverage these data to understand variant impact, elucidate the effect of dysregulated genes on biological pathways in specific disease and tissue contexts, and interpret disease risk beyond what is feasible with experiments alone. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in machine learning algorithms for genome interpretation and for integrative molecular-level modelling of cells, tissues and organs relevant to disease. More specifically, we highlight existing methods and key challenges and opportunities in identifying specific disease-causing genetic variants and linking them to molecular pathways and, ultimately, to disease phenotypes.

### An update on autophagy disorders [^116aMbvL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Monogenic disorders of autophagy are a group of inherited diseases that affect core and selective autophagy as well as intricately linked pathways, leading to a multitude of clinical manifestations. While the clinical features of monogenic disorders of autophagy are diverse and can affect multiple organ systems, there are common clinico‐pathological signatures that may prompt clinicians to consider this important and evolving group of (neuro)metabolic conditions in their differential diagnosis. Recent basic and translational studies have enabled a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying these complex and variable disorders and may enable future therapy development.

### Unbiased discovery of cancer pathways and therapeutics using pathway ensemble tool and benchmark [^113Jo99F]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathogenesis of complex diseases is often underpinned by dysregulation of several cellular pathways. This is well exemplified by neoplastic diseases, where abnormalities in multiple pathways contribute to cancerous transformation or in which cancer-disposing events perturb multiple cellular pathways. Despite notable successes in some cancers, limited therapeutic gains have been made by identification and targeting of single contributory genes. Precisely pinpointing key dysregulated celluar pathways in cancer and ranking them by order of importance is, therefore, of major biological and clinical significance. Doing so would enable molecular subtyping, determination of diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and inform choice of effective and cancer-specific drug regimens. This is especially important at the present time because the incidence of cancer is increasing.

The contemporary approach to elucidate aberrations in biological pathways is dominated by omics methods, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). As expected, vast amounts of omics data have been generated for most cancers. However, unlocking their full potential has remained challenging. Biological pathway analysis, a computational search to identify and rank by importance the key relevant and/or dysregulated pathways among the thousands of known potential biological pathways, is a critical means for deciphering these data. Numerous in silico methods (reviewed here,), for example GSEAand Enrichr, have been developed and broadly applied to conduct pathway analyses. One common application of these methods has been to test whether specific pathways hypothesized by researchers are, in fact, enriched in a dataset. In this approach, pathway enrichment analyses have generally proven successful, but pre-suppose a priori knowledge or hypothesis. An alternative, highly desired application, especially in the context of exponentially growing omics datasets, is the adoption of unbiased discovery-based approaches. Here, the objective is to rank the "correct pathways" above all other pathways in the reported results without imparting bias from a priori knowledge. However, the performance and suitability of existing pathway analysis methods for this form of blinded or unbiased discovery remains largely unknown. In other words, it is not known how often the top pathway(s) returned by an analysis method represent(s) the most important perturbation. This is likely due to the fact that most methods were developed and evaluated ("benchmarked") using computer simulated pathwaysor verified only in very small scale biological datasets from historical, low-resolution microarray technology. Therefore, a key limitation is lack of proper benchmarking and assessment of the capacity of these tools for pathway discovery under experimental settings, which often contain substantial "noise" due to stochastic events and biological variations. Such lack of a suitable evaluation platform predicated on large-scale experimental data significantly impedes informed deployment of pathway analysis tools for blinded discovery of perturbations in cancer.

### Using endophenotypes for pathway clusters to map complex disease genes [^1151B9os]. Genetic Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Nature determines the complexity of disease etiology and the likelihood of revealing disease genes. While culprit genes for many monogenic diseases have been successfully unraveled, efforts to map major complex disease genes have not been as productive as hoped. The conceptual framework currently adopted to deal with the heterogeneous nature of complex diseases focuses on using homogeneous internal features of the disease phenotype for mapping. However, phenotypic homogeneity does not equal genotypic homogeneity. In this report, we advocate working with well-measured phenotypes portrayed by amounts of transcripts and activities of gene products or their metabolites, which are pertinent to relatively small pathway clusters. Reliable and controlled measures for oligogenic traits resulting from proper dissection efforts may enhance statistical power. The large amounts of information obtained on gene and protein expression from technological advances can add to the power of gene finding, particularly for diseases with unclear etiology. Data-mining tools for dimension reduction can assist biologists to reveal novel molecular endophenotypes. However, there are still hurdles to overcome, including high cost, relatively poor reproducibility and comparability among platforms, the cross-sectional nature of the information, and the accessibility of human tissues. Concerted efforts are required to carry out large-scale prospective studies that are integrated at the levels of phenotype characterization, high throughput experimental techniques, data analyses, and beyond.

### Cutaneous granulomas: mechanisms, cellular interactions and therapeutic insights [^115Mneaf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Granulomas are specialized biologic defence mechanisms that form in response to infections by pathogens, foreign bodies or specific stimuli such as antimicrobials or fungi. These structures function to isolate foreign materials and pathogens that cannot be eliminated by immune cells, primarily through macrophage activity. In the skin, granulomas are a hallmark of several conditions, including sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, tuberculosis and leprosy, each exhibiting distinct pathological and immunological features. Granulomas can also arise from lipid accumulation, as observed in xanthogranuloma, or be triggered by inflammatory processes associated with unidentified antigens. Among their cellular components, Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells play a pivotal role in granuloma structure and function, contributing to pathogen containment and tissue remodelling, although their precise mechanisms of action remain an area of active investigation. In addition to these giant cells, recent studies have identified triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)+ macrophages as key contributors to granuloma formation and maintenance. These macrophages are involved in extracellular degradation of foreign substances and play a role in adapting to the hypoxic and nutrient-poor microenvironment of granulomas through metabolic reprogramming, including the pentose phosphate pathway. Recent advances in molecular biology, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have provided unprecedented insights into the cellular heterogeneity and molecular pathways involved in granuloma formation. These techniques have revealed disease-specific differences in immune cell profiles and activation states, offering new perspectives on the underlying mechanisms of granulomatous diseases. Despite these advances, the precise processes driving granuloma formation and their functional significance remain largely unclear. This review addresses the central question, 'What is a granuloma?', by synthesizing recent findings, with a particular focus on cutaneous granulomas, and presenting interpretations grounded in the current body of literature. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted immunomodulation and cytokine blockade, which hold promise for treating granulomatous diseases while preserving host defence.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for integrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity treatment: a framework for pragmatic, patient-centered care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114g5nzF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — abstract states that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of the most common chronic medical conditions worldwide and that most patients with ASCVD have other chronic conditions. It notes that fractionated care plans, polypharmacy, side effects, drug-drug interactions, and financial toxicity can accumulate with multimorbidity and advancing age, and clinicians need better guidance to mitigate ASCVD progression and major adverse cardiovascular events within the context of other conditions and therapies. The pathway is applicable to patients of all ages with ASCVD and multimorbidity and advocates integrating evidence-based treatments into a value-based care framework that incorporates the American Geriatrics Society's principles, the 4Ms from the Age Friendly Health System, the 4-domain framework of care for older adults with heart failure, and social determinants of health. As patients acquire more chronic conditions, the burdens of therapy intensify while life expectancy shortens, and care must shift from recommending all evidence-based options to prioritizing therapies with the greatest expected benefit/harm profile aligned with patients' goals and preferences.

### Pathway analysis approaches for rare and common variants: insights from genetic analysis workshop 18 [^1118ptU3]. Genetic Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathway analysis, broadly defined as a group of methods incorporating a priori biological information from public databases, has emerged as a promising approach for analyzing high-dimensional genomic data. As part of Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, seven research groups applied pathway analysis techniques to whole-genome sequence data from the San Antonio Family Study. Overall, the groups found that the potential of pathway analysis to improve detection of causal variants by lowering the multiple-testing burden and incorporating biologic insight remains largely unrealized. Specifically, there is a lack of best practices at each stage of the pathway approach: annotation, analysis, interpretation, and follow-up. Annotation of genetic variants is inconsistent across databases, incomplete, and biased toward known genes. At the analysis stage insufficient statistical power remains a major challenge. Analyses combining rare and common variants may have an inflated type I error rate and may not improve detection of causal genes. Inclusion of known causal genes may not improve statistical power, although the fraction of explained phenotypic variance may be a more appropriate metric. Interpretation of findings is further complicated by evidence in support of interactions between pathways and by the lack of consensus on how to best incorporate functional information. Finally, all presented approaches warranted follow-up studies, both to reduce the likelihood of false-positive findings and to identify specific causal variants within a given pathway. Despite the initial promise of pathway analysis for modeling biological complexity of disease phenotypes, many methodological challenges currently remain to be addressed.

### Analysing biological pathways in genome-wide association studies [^112MxL9E]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2010). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have typically focused on the analysis of single markers, which often lacks the power to uncover the relatively small effect sizes conferred by most genetic variants. Recently, pathway-based approaches have been developed, which use prior biological knowledge on gene function to facilitate more powerful analysis of GWA study data sets. These approaches typically examine whether a group of related genes in the same functional pathway are jointly associated with a trait of interest. Here we review the development of pathway-based approaches for GWA studies, discuss their practical use and caveats, and suggest that pathway-based approaches may also be useful for future GWA studies with sequencing data.

### Rare versus common diseases: a false dichotomy in precision medicine [^115DLEsY]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Some readers will have noticed a contradiction between two of our key points. If a common disease is a series of rare diseases, might that require a series of HKMD-inspired drugs? Much has been written about the genetic and environmental architecture of complex multifactorial diseases, and it is dangerous to generalize to all common diseases. However, to the extent that a disease has a common final pathway of phenotypic or clinical expression triggered by many different genetic and environmental factors, one HKMD-inspired drug may be effective for a large fraction of affected individuals. This certainly is the hope for PCSK9 inhibitors, although more years of data are required to see if they improve cardiovascular health under all genetic and environmental backgrounds. The bigger change that we wish to catalyze is the idea that sequencing people without the disease of interest may be a more efficient way to identify drug targets. Finding a LOF that causes a Mendelian disease does not immediately point us towards a drug target, but finding a LOF that confers a pharmaceutically desirable phenotype does. HKMDs need not be inherited. Some might be de novo mutations. Many are likely to be even rarer than the Mendelian disease alleles that have been the focus of so many fruitful studies. The challenge is to define traits worth emulating by drugs, and to phenotypically screen a very large population for people with these traits.

### The emerging paradigm of network medicine in the study of human disease [^116PWgpa]. Circulation Research (2012). Low credibility.

The molecular pathways that govern human disease consist of molecular circuits that coalesce into complex, overlapping networks. These network pathways are presumably regulated in a coordinated fashion, but such regulation has been difficult to decipher using only reductionistic principles. The emerging paradigm of "network medicine" proposes to utilize insights garnered from network topology (eg, the static position of molecules in relation to their neighbors) as well as network dynamics (eg, the unique flux of information through the network) to understand better the pathogenic behavior of complex molecular interconnections that traditional methods fail to recognize. As methodologies evolve, network medicine has the potential to capture the molecular complexity of human disease while offering computational methods to discern how such complexity controls disease manifestations, prognosis, and therapy. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of network medicine and explores the feasibility and potential impact of network-based methods for predicting individual manifestations of human disease and designing rational therapies. Wherever possible, we emphasize the application of these principles to cardiovascular disease.

### Precision medicine in autoimmune diseases: fact or fiction [^113Z1nom]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Much is said about precision medicine, but its real significance and potential are far from certain. Several studies in each of the autoimmune diseases have provided important insights into molecular pathways, but the use of molecular studies, particularly those looking into transcriptome pathways, has seldom approached the possibility of using the data for disease stratification and then for prediction, or for diagnosis. Only the type I IFN signature has been considered for therapeutic purposes, particularly in the case of SLE. This review provides an update on precision medicine, on what can be translated into clinical practice and on what single-cell molecular studies contribute to our knowledge of autoimmune diseases, focusing on a few examples. The main message is that we should try to move from precision medicine of established diseases to preventive medicine in order to predict the development of disease.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Ud1Ri]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus — management of comorbidities in heart failure (HF) notes that patients with HF, particularly older patients, frequently have other cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV comorbidities that affect their prognosis, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, anemia/iron deficiency, sleep disorders, and chronic lung disease. The presence of multiple chronic conditions is associated with increased symptom burden, may contribute to progression of underlying disease, and often plays a role in a large proportion of hospitalizations in patients with HF. Given the complex relationships between HF and many conditions, it is challenging to outline specific recommendations, additional evidence and large-scale trial data are needed, and appropriate referral to clinicians with experience treating various comorbidities is a particularly important aspect of management. Specific management recommendations can be made in some situations; Table 15 classifies comorbidities between CV and non-CV processes and provides guidance, and 3 conditions that deserve particular mention are diabetes, viral respiratory infections, and anemia/iron deficiency. For diabetes, it is common and strongly associated with both incident HF and adverse clinical outcomes and is closely linked to hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease; treatment of patients with T2D with SGLT inhibitors improves glycemic control and also significantly reduces HF events in patients with established CV disease or CV risk factors.

### COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations and disease: insights into pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets [^114bobqK]. Human Molecular Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In a relatively brief period of time, COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations have been discovered to cause a broad spectrum of debilitating or fatal diseases. Pathology varies in penetrance and severity among tissues and can be modulated by genetic and environmental factors. Model organisms will be key for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with specific mutations. Mouse models can be used to understand genotype–phenotype correlations, provide insight into the contribution of allelic heterogeneity and identify genetic modifiers that could lead to the discovery of novel molecular pathways involved in the etiology of COL4A1- and COL4A2 -associated disorders. The use of conditional mutants will be valuable to genetically dissect the tissue-specific effects of different mutations. Understanding the biological consequences of COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations is critical to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. As the molecular mechanisms of disease are discovered, we can better predict and address the effects of particular mutations, and potentially provide targeted therapeutic options to patients with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations.

### Inhibiting TGF-β signaling pathway for disease therapy: challenges and opportunities [^114bgK1w]. Cytokine (2025). Medium credibility.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a multifunctional cytokine expressed in nearly all human tissues and cell types. The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development, cell and tissue differentiation, and tissue homeostasis in adults. Aberrant regulation of this pathway is closely associated with various diseases, indicating that the TGF-β signaling pathway represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Notably, diseases linked to the disruption of the TGF-β signaling pathway include cancer, vascular disorders, wound healing complications, tissue fibrosis, and autoimmune diseases. The development and optimization of selective inhibitors targeting TGF-β could provide viable therapeutic options for the clinical treatment of these conditions. Consequently, targeting the cytokine TGF-β and its signaling pathway may offer a novel and promising treatment strategy for related diseases. This review summarizes recent studies on the role of TGF-β in the pathogenesis and treatment of associated diseases.

### Immune-mediated disease genetics: the shared basis of pathogenesis [^112n15Lc]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent genetic studies in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have identified hundreds of genomic loci harboring risk variants. These variants are shared between diseases at unexpectedly high rates, providing a molecular basis for the shared pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease. If properly used, these results could allow us to identify specific pathways underlying disease; explain disease heterogeneity by grouping patients by molecular causes rather than overall symptomatology; and develop more rational approaches to diagnosis and therapy targeting these molecular defects. Here we review the current state of play in the genetics of immune-mediated disease, evidence for this sharing and how this new knowledge can lead to medically actionable discoveries of pathobiology.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathway timeline and scope — The timeline for development is more compressed than a Clinical Practice Guideline, usually in the range of 8 to 12 months, during which time the Work Group tracks emerging evidence and incorporates it into the pathway. Determination of the scope is a critical early step, and the Work Group should keep the scope wide enough to provide guidance on the most important clinical questions yet not so broad as to be unmanageable within the narrow timeframe typically allotted for content development.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Patient–clinician shared decision-making prioritizes eliciting values, framing prognosis, ranking options, and forming a plan with explicit prompts: "Assess patient's perceptions and readiness for discussion" and consider "Preference for aggressiveness of care (medical maximizer vs. minimizer)"; for prognosis, it notes "Particularly relevant for screening and preventive measures with a long time horizon" and to "Recognize uncertainty; 'Plan for the worst, hope for the best', discuss 'Plan B'". Options are ranked by "Pick up to a few/high-value areas to discuss with the patient", "Prioritize therapies that address multiple chronic conditions simultaneously with a high impact", and synergies such as "Is there a therapy that treats multiple conditions (e.g. ACEI/ARB for hypertension/HF/CKD; SGLT2i for HF/diabetes/CKD; beta-blocker for AF/HF/CAD)?" (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI]; angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]). Clinicians "If applicable, include 'why' (e.g., net clinical benefit)", patients "Verbalizes what was heard: 'ask-tell-ask'", "Ask questions", and "Provides willingness/ability to adhere with recommended treatments", and teams "Re-evaluate decisions; come to agreement on medication/therapy" and "Decide on whether to start, stop, or continue treatments".

### Systematic decision frameworks for the socially responsible use of precision medicine [^113ZZ5Nb]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At this stage, it is important to address what we mean by 'causation' for the purposes of this paper. Indeed, one might question how a biological category like a genetic feature could be a cause of a social phenomenon like how someone is racialized. Following Gerstenberg and Tenenbaum, we view causal theories as "probabilistic, generative programs", according to which effects can be computed from their causes via noisy algorithms. One can view the way someone is racialized as computed (via a stochastic, socio-physical algorithm) from a myriad of factors, some of which may include genetic features. By the same token, an increased probability of realizing certain health outcomes may or may not be influenced, via a similarly stochastic, socio-physical algorithm, by someone's race. The exact structure of the probabilistic programs that generate the data we observe in the world leaves statistical traces in that data. For example, though two variables may be correlated even though one is not caused by the other, these correlations will disappear once we condition on the causes of both variables. This principle, known as the "causal Markov condition", enables us to induce causal structure from purely associational data in at least some cases. As an example, the use of windshield wipers and the use of umbrellas on a given street may be correlated over time, but this correlation disappears once we restrict our attention to only those cases in which it is raining.

As a second point of clarification, it is crucial to note that in some cases, we may not be especially concerned with avoiding the use of genetic predictors of disease whose predictive accuracy is largely due to a socio-causal pathway from the presence of the genetic feature to the protected characteristic and then to the presence of the disease. In other words, we may identify a particular genetic trait as responsible for a particular pattern of racialization, which in turn may be responsible for a person's having a higher likelihood of developing a disease. Strong evidence for such a causal pathway could be used to redress health inequalities in a salutary way. What we aim to caution against, however, is the use of such a genetic predictor without explicit attention to and communication of the social pathways through which it operates. Such usage risks the essentializing inferences highlighted above, while also suggesting biological solutions to what are often demonstrably social problems.

### Methodologies underpinning polygenic risk scores estimation: a comprehensive overview [^113pBbYU]. Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathway-based PRS method

Evidently, a great amount of effort is being put into the development and optimisation of PRS calculation tools. Ideally, these approaches could help stratify individuals based on their relative risk of developing a particular disease. However, genome-wide PRS methods cannot always provide great insights into the heterogeneity of complex disease (Broekema et al; Choi et al; Visscher et al.). In fact, genome-wide PRS are dominated by variants that affect multiple disease sub-types, which means that unless deep phenotyping of a disease/trait is generated prior to association testing, the genome-wide aggregation of effects reduces variants' specificity (Choi et al.). Therefore, these methods are limited-by-design in their inability to stratify individuals into disease sub-types. To circumvent the issue, Choi and colleagues propose PRSet, the first pathway-based PRS approach and software (Choi et al.). The tool was designed to calculate PRS by incorporating variants with significant genetic signal at pathway-level and variants in regions which have higher heritability. This therefore provides a genetic risk prediction method that accounts for an individual's more complete genetic profile. PRSet would therefore be able to further stratify individuals into groups of more homogenous disease sub-types and thus offering a proof-a-principle of their potential utility to provide more powerful paths to precision medicine (Choi et al.).

### Visual electrophysiology and "the potential of the potentials" [^115gjUV1]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Visual electrophysiology affords direct, quantitative, objective assessment of visual pathway function at different levels, and thus yields information complementary to, and not necessarily obtainable from, imaging or psychophysical testing. The tests available, and their indications, have evolved, with many advances, both in technology and in our understanding of the neural basis of the waveforms, now facilitating more precise evaluation of physiology and pathophysiology. After summarising the visual pathway and current standard clinical testing methods, this review discusses, non-exhaustively, several developments, focusing particularly on human electroretinogram recordings. These include new devices (portable, non-mydiatric, multimodal), novel testing protocols (including those aiming to separate rod-driven and cone-driven responses, and to monitor retinal adaptation), and developments in methods of analysis, including use of modelling and machine learning. It is likely that several tests will become more accessible and useful in both clinical and research settings. In future, these methods will further aid our understanding of common and rare eye disease, will help in assessing novel therapies, and will potentially yield information relevant to neurological and neuro-psychiatric conditions.

### A framework for pathway knowledge driven prioritization in genome-wide association studies [^113SJpUL]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the context of prioritizing SNPs in GWA studies, the primary focus has been on SNP‐level annotations such as those based on physical context of a SNP (genic/intergenic or exonic/intronic) and tissue specific functional annotations overlapping a SNP (e.g. promoter/enhancer marks, open chromatin, etc.), or SNPs assoicated with multiple correlated traits (Bhattacharjee et al. 2012; Ellinghaus et al. 2016). Lesser attention has been given to gene‐level annotations (such as pathways), in terms of using pathway knowledge a priori to guide discovery in GWAS. Pathways constitute a rich source of prior knowledge in the sense that, the genes mapping to loci identified from GWAS of particular disease tend to cluster into a few specific biological pathways/networks. This prior information is ignored when one conducts an unbiased traditional GWAS. To give a hypothetical example, suppose that 90% of all infectious disease susceptibility SNPs map to genes within a small number of pathways (saypathways) related to immunity. Due to accumulation of several small effects of multiple variants, such pathways can be identified as "relatively important" empirically based on a "peek" at the GWAS data. A SNP "A" on a gene that maps to of these out of theseimportant pathways is a priori much more likely to be a true susceptibility SNP, compared to another SNP "B" that is in a gene desert or a SNP "C" that maps to genes in other pathways, and hence it is natural to upweight SNP "A" relative to SNPs "B" and "C" as a genome‐wide multiple‐testing strategy to improve overall power of discovery. In this strategy, multiple SNPs clustering in some common pathways boost each other to receive higher weight, whereas SNPs in isolated or insufficiently annotated genes automatically get down‐weighted.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115RJbX3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — scope, diagnostic framework, and management principles — states that the principal focus is on adults with acute myocarditis, provides new diagnostic criteria, and proposes a new 4-stage classification; management varies by severity, stage, and specific etiology, and identification of specific etiologies is important to allow prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies and supportive care. It emphasizes that timely referral of severe myocarditis patients to specialists and medical centers with advanced diagnostic and management capabilities such as transplant and mechanical circulatory support is critically important, and defines indications for referral to allow timely consideration of advanced therapies in high-risk patients. Surveillance strategy, monitoring for recovery, and recommended activity restrictions vary according to severity of presentation, specific etiology, comorbidities, and clinical trajectory, and the document addresses indications for surveillance of recovery and guidance for return to activity. The document also notes that health insurance coverage may not include repeat imaging and/or testing following myocarditis diagnosis or initial testing with advanced imaging in the outpatient setting, even though patients may require repeat diagnostic evaluation to ascertain resolution of previously documented cardiac abnormalities, to define prognosis, and/or for consideration of additional therapies such as guideline-directed management of cardiomyopathy or HF should they develop cardiac dysfunction.

### A pathway-based approach to identify molecular biomarkers in cancer [^116SfPQt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Many examples highlight the power of gene expression profiles, or signatures, to provide an understanding of biological phenotypes. This is best seen in the context of cancer, where expression signatures have tremendous power to identify new cancer subtypes and to predict clinical outcomes. Gene expression profiles have been developed to personalize medicine, accurately predicting disease recurrence and tumor response to therapy. The use of these signatures as surrogate phenotypes allows us to link diverse experimental systems, which dissect the complexity of biological systems, with the in vivo setting in a way that was not previously feasible. Taken together, these new genomic tools provide the opportunity to develop rational strategies for treating the individual cancer patient.

### Comparison of molecular signatures from multiple skin diseases identifies mechanisms of immunopathogenesis [^1172gpDf]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to obtain gene expression profiles from human disease specimens provides an opportunity to identify relevant gene pathways, but is limited by the absence of data sets spanning a broad range of conditions. Here, we analyzed publicly available microarray data from 16 diverse skin conditions in order to gain insight into disease pathogenesis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated samples by disease as well as common cellular and molecular pathways. Disease-specific signatures were leveraged to build a multi-disease classifier, which predicted the diagnosis of publicly and prospectively collected expression profiles with 93% accuracy. In one sample, the molecular classifier differed from the initial clinical diagnosis and correctly predicted the eventual diagnosis as the clinical presentation evolved. Finally, integration of IFN-regulated gene programs with the skin database revealed a significant inverse correlation between IFN-β and IFN-γ programs across all conditions. Our study provides an integrative approach to the study of gene signatures from multiple skin conditions, elucidating mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. In addition, these studies provide a framework for developing tools for personalized medicine toward the precise prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease on an individual level.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of therapy responses in allergic diseases and asthma [^114dqxj6]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

15 CONCLUSIONS

In our discipline, a huge amount of omics research has been employed during recent years that needs to be analyzed in depth. Allergic diseases are a group of complex and heterogeneous diseases. Specific, sensitive and reliable (point‐of‐care) biomarkers are critical for selecting the proper treatment for the proper patient and enabling precision medicine. Precision endotyping is linking pathobiological mechanisms with visible properties via specific biomarkers. It is expected to be translated into pathway‐specific diagnostic tests and opens a pathway to accurate disease classification and individualized targeted treatment options. We are expecting to change the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape in our specialty as well as of all medical disciplines. However, endotype‐driven treatment still needs to face multiple challenges before its implementation in daily practice in allergic diseases and asthma. Most of the disease endotyping research is conducted in severe forms of allergic diseases nowadays. Over the past few years, the biomarker discovery field has gained great advances, which facilitates the identification of novel methods for disease diagnosis and therapy. With these fast growing efforts, we can imagine that in the near future, we will be able to find better ways to treat allergic diseases, with a therapeutic approach targeted to the individual patient.

### Intersection of immune signaling and cell death: the bidirectional regulatory mechanism of STING pathway and ferroptosis [^111gpoEb]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The STING signaling pathway is a central component of the innate immune system, primarily responsible for sensing cytosolic DNA and triggering type I interferon responses to regulate innate immune signaling. Recent studies have revealed that, beyond its roles in immune responses, inflammation, and infection, STING can also regulate metabolism and cell death through classical or non-classical signaling pathways. Ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and infections. Emerging research has demonstrated a correlation between STING and ferroptosis. STING activation induces the production of inflammatory factors and cytokines, which disrupt iron homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative balance, thereby triggering ferroptosis. Meanwhile, key proteins like GPX4 and ACSL4 in ferroptosis along with certain metabolic products can also influence the activity of the STING signaling pathway. The regulatory direction and signaling intensity of these interactions significantly impact disease states. As a result, deciphering their molecular mechanisms is critical for developing precise therapeutic strategies. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest research advances related to the STING signaling pathway and ferroptosis, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying their mutual regulation. In addition, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting STING signaling and ferroptosis in disease pathology, thereby highlighting their prospective clinical significance in conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112mL46y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Optimization of RV assessment in clinical research — Trials designed to detect differences in clinical worsening or survival often require substantial sample sizes that are difficult to achieve in rare diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), particularly when the intervention is added to background therapy. A well-chosen RV surrogate endpoint in clinical trials may facilitate trial design and ultimately drug approval because right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in PAH. A given endpoint needs to satisfy a number of criteria to serve as a surrogate for hard clinical outcomes before incorporation into trials, and it should be reliable, integral to the disease causal pathway, and targeted by the intervention of interest.

### Towards precision MRI biomarkers in epilepsy with normative modelling [^114DNsDw]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders, with an estimated 50 million individuals living with the condition worldwide. However, aggregating these millions of individuals under a single disease umbrella is potentially misleading; epilepsy encompasses a vast range of conditions, with the common feature being a predisposition to recurrent seizures. Perhaps in part due to this indiscriminate nomenclature, for decades the dominant pathway for therapeutic management of epilepsy has been a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, despite known heterogeneity in the underlying causes and mechanisms that drive seizures. Correspondingly, the proportion of individuals with medication-resistant epilepsy has remained virtually unchanged over the past 30 years (at ∼30%–40% of epilepsy patients), even with the explosion in novel molecular therapeutics. The need for individualized approaches to therapy has become increasingly evident, and epilepsy is now recognized as a leading target for precision medicine, following on from the successes in cancer therapy.

Precision medicine is defined as treatment that is tailored to the needs of each individual patient, taking into account the specific causes of disease and targeting these for therapy. Although there has been an intellectual paradigm shift towards personalized approaches in the epilepsies, the focus of precision diagnostics and therapy has been largely limited to targeting specific genetic causes, despite monogenic epilepsies representing only a small subset of all epilepsy patients. Precision care need not be limited to those with genetically defined epilepsies. To deliver personalized care for all, there is a need for appropriate precision diagnostics that extend beyond genetics and include the neuroimaging phenotype, electroclinical signature, demographic characteristics, neuropsychological profile and comorbidities of a given individual. Amongst these, MRI stands out as an important precision tool for diagnosis, particularly in individuals with medically refractory epilepsy for whom disease burden and associated risks can be particularly substantial. Although the future of epilepsy precision care will undoubtedly require multi-dimensional approaches that incorporate multiple phenotypic characteristics of an individual, we focus here on the major strides needed in neuroimaging research to deliver personalized tools for clinical use in epilepsy.

### The genetics of common kidney disease: a pathway toward clinical relevance [^1174g9JE]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have advanced our understanding of the genetic basis for common renal diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and related traits such as hypertension. The 'common variant, common disease' hypothesis-the theoretical basis for gene mapping by GWASs-has, however, underestimated the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying these diseases. The disease-specific variants identified by GWASs, despite being supported by statistically robust associations, often fail to illuminate the biology underlying the association and explain only a small portion of the estimated heritability of these diseases, even in aggregate. Although these variants have highlighted novel pathways that can be targeted therapeutically, their small effect sizes have minimal effects on diagnosis, prognosis, and management of individual patients. At present, therefore, the data do not support the routine use of genetic testing in the management of patients with CKD. Advances in technology, such as massively parallel gene sequencing, and characterization of alternative modes of inheritance should further elucidate the genetic architecture of CKD and provide tools to improve patient care.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for integrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity treatment: a framework for pragmatic, patient-centered care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114JTyov]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway conclusion — patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) often have multiple chronic conditions, and clinical practice guidelines frequently address a single condition and do not provide sufficient guidance for patients with multimorbidity. This ECDP takes a comprehensive and integrative look at treating patients with ASCVD and multimorbidity based on the patient's phase of life, with emphasis on a value-based framework that encourages prioritizing therapy tailored within a 4-domain framework. Such an approach provides clinicians and members of the care team with a multidimensional understanding of the patient to better promote care optimization. Importantly, patients' goals, priorities, and preferences should be included when making treatment decisions, and tools should be included to facilitate implementation. Health systems should promote a team-based approach, leveraging interconnected EHRs to facilitate implementation of the domain framework to improve patient care. Health systems should formally evaluate the impacts of implementing the domain framework and the tools from this ECDP on patients, clinicians, and the health system itself. Professional organizations should advocate for legislative efforts to reward holistic, patient-centered care.

### Multi-modal quantification of pathway activity with MAYA [^113P7sQj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Signaling pathways can be activated through various cascades of genes depending on cell identity and biological context. Single-cell atlases now provide the opportunity to inspect such complexity in health and disease. Yet, existing reference tools for pathway scoring resume activity of each pathway to one unique common metric across cell types. Here, we present MAYA, a computational method that enables the automatic detection and scoring of the diverse modes of activation of biological pathways across cell populations. MAYA improves the granularity of pathway analysis by detecting subgroups of genes within reference pathways, each characteristic of a cell population and how it activates a pathway. Using multiple single-cell datasets, we demonstrate the biological relevance of identified modes of activation, the robustness of MAYA to noisy pathway lists and batch effect. MAYA can also predict cell types starting from lists of reference markers in a cluster-free manner. Finally, we show that MAYA reveals common modes of pathway activation in tumor cells across patients, opening the perspective to discover shared therapeutic vulnerabilities.

### Precision medicine in surgery: immunomodulation and cellular regeneration strategies for immunologic and surgical diseases [^112yyFDP]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

We recognize that immune disorders vary widely in their underlying mechanisms and clinical presentation. Our intention is not to suggest a single pathway can explain or treat all forms of immune dysfunction. Instead, we aim to point out that certain signaling pathways, such as IL-6, NF-κB, and mTOR, are recurrently involved across different conditions. Understanding these points of overlap can help guide more focused and context-specific therapies. This perspective does not oversimplify complex diseases but encourages a thoughtful approach to identifying shared mechanisms that may be targeted with precision. Lacritin serves as one example of a therapeutic candidate that interacts with these shared pathways, and its use must be tailored to the specific immune environment and disease context.

A defining feature of this study was the integration of high-dimensional immunoprofiling techniques, including CyTOF and scRNAseq. These technologies provide a detailed map of cellular responses at single-cell resolution, capturing the dynamic shifts in immune populations and their functional states. By using CyTOF, we were able to analyze complex immune interactions within disease-affected tissues, whereas scRNAseq provided transcriptional insights into the molecular mechanisms driving disease progression. The use of spatial imaging techniques, such as IMC, further enhances the impact of this study by preserving the tissue architecture while allowing for multiparameter profiling. This approach is particularly relevant to autoimmune diseases, where the spatial distribution of immune cells and tissue remodeling influence disease progression. These tools are critical for precision medicine, as they allow for the identification of patient-specific immune signatures and guide the development of targeted immunotherapies. The application of these methodologies in preclinical research strengthens the translational potential of novel therapies, offering a deeper understanding of how candidate molecules regulate immune and cellular pathways, which can be translated from preclinical to clinical applications. In the current framework, lacritin seems to serve a dual role. It functions as a marker of epithelial and immune stress, indicated by its reduced levels in disease, and also acts as an active modulator of immune and metabolic dysfunction when restored. In this way, it may respond to inflammation while also contributing to the rebalancing of immune responses. We do not believe that lacritin promotes indiscriminate regeneration. Rather, its effect seems to be selective and context-dependent.

Challenges and opportunities for rare disease treatment

Despite recent progress in the development of targeted therapies (Table 1), the promise of precision medicine remains out of reach for most children with a rare disease, which have historically been less attractive to commercial development given the small number of affected individuals –. Treatments modifying the underlying disease mechanism are more likely to be transformative than less specific, symptom-based treatments, given their greater likelihood of improving many, if not all, features of a condition. Such therapies could be targeted to the individual disease gene or could be pathway-based for related disorders (e.g. mTORopathies, RASopathies) (Fig. 3). Precision nutritional and vitamin or trace element-based therapies, and some enzyme replacement therapies, have established roles as treatment of some rare diseases, particularly genetic metabolic disorders. More recently, pioneering clinical trials have demonstrated proof-of-concept for developing safe and effective precision therapies acting at the DNA, RNA, or protein level for rare diseases. Some of these, such as gene-based therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and sickle cell disease, and protein-based treatments for cystic fibrosis, have transformed patient outcomes and received regulatory approval for use in clinical practice –. Researchers have also reported progress toward precision therapies customized to patient-specific DNA variants for ultra-rare diseases, such as 'n-of-1' antisense oligonucleotide therapy, gene therapy, and the promising and versatile prime editing technique, which can insert, delete, or change selected base pairs –.

### Using genome-wide pathway analysis to unravel the etiology of complex diseases [^116szFr3]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published on various complex diseases. Although, new loci are found to be associated with these diseases, still only very little of the genetic risk for these diseases can be explained. As GWAS are still underpowered to find small main effects, and gene-gene interactions are likely to play a role, the data might currently not be analyzed to its full potential. In this study, we evaluated alternative methods to study GWAS data. Instead of focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the highest statistical significance, we took advantage of prior biological information and tried to detect overrepresented pathways in the GWAS data. We evaluated whether pathway classification analysis can help prioritize the biological pathways most likely to be involved in the disease etiology. In this study, we present the various benefits and limitations of pathway-classification tools in analyzing GWAS data. We show multiple differences in outcome between pathway tools analyzing the same dataset. Furthermore, analyzing randomly selected SNPs always results in significantly overrepresented pathways, large pathways have a higher chance of becoming statistically significant and the bioinformatics tools used in this study are biased toward detecting well-defined pathways. As an example, we analyzed data from two GWAS on type 2 diabetes (T2D): the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). Occasionally the results from the DGI and the WTCCC GWAS showed concordance in overrepresented pathways, but discordance in the corresponding genes. Thus, incorporating gene networks and pathway classification tools into the analysis can point toward significantly overrepresented molecular pathways, which cannot be picked up using traditional single-locus analyses. However, the limitations discussed in this study, need to be addressed before these methods can be widely used.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) clinical care pathway for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — The AGA assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a Clinical Care Pathway providing explicit guidance on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD. Because NAFLD is largely asymptomatic and optimal timing of treatment depends on accurate staging of fibrosis risk, screening at the primary care level is critical. The pathway assists clinicians in diagnosing and managing NAFLD with clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2–F4) and is intended to be applicable in any setting where care for patients with NAFLD is provided, including primary care, endocrine, obesity medicine, and gastroenterology practices; most patients with NAFLD and NASH are seen in primary care or endocrine clinics.

### Genes and genomes and unnecessary complexity in precision medicine [^116snLcu]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

By necessary complexity at the molecular level, we mean the minimum number of gene-gene interactions and minimum biochemical path lengths necessary for a given molecular function, trait or an organism. However, because of linkage, new mutations, new interactions, and, most importantly, the blind nature of the selection process, evolution necessarily leads to the creation of extra, repetitious interactions of a roundabout nature, crisscrossing existing biochemical pathways and increasing the length of the molecular pathways. This is unnecessary complexity. Here, the term 'unnecessary' refers to a particular biochemical pathway and does not apply to any future usefulness of the complex pathway in a changing environment. It is important to point out that unnecessary complexity should not be considered superfluous 'noise', but is rather an integral part of the evolutionary process and of the genome itself.

It is worth mentioning that several of our colleagues have suggested alternative terms for unnecessary complexity, for example, redundancy, excess complexity, chance complexity or unpredictable complexity. Our choice, i.e. unnecessary complexity, is not perfect but it implies what we want to convey, that it is an unwanted evolutionary baggage due to ever increasing and accumulating molecular interactions and long molecular pathways. It does not mean that unnecessary complexity has no effect on the operation or the outcome of natural selection now or in the future.

### Emerging pathway to a precision medicine approach for angina with Nonobstructive coronary arteries in Women [^112Z2pZr]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Women are disproportionately affected by symptoms of angina with nonobstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA) which is associated with significant mortality and economic impact. Although distinct endotypes of ANOCA have been defined, it is underdiagnosed and is often incompletely characterized when identified. Patients are often unresponsive to traditional therapeutic options, which are typically antianginal, and the current ability to guide treatment modification by specific pathways is limited. Studies have associated specific genetic loci, transcriptomic features, and biomarkers with ANOCA. Such panomic data, in combination with known imaging and invasive diagnostic techniques, should be utilized to define more precise pathophysiologic subtypes of ANOCA in women, which will in turn help to identify targeted, effective therapies. A precision medicine-based approach to managing ANOCA incorporating these techniques in women has the potential to significantly improve their clinical care.

### Interleukins and their signaling pathways in the reactome biological pathway database [^116cAUrd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Reactome is a free database of human biological pathways available through the Reactome Web site, where content can be searched, viewed, and downloaded. Pathways are annotated manually by professional curators and peer reviewed by expert biologists. The aim is to represent the consensus view for each area of biology in a reliable and consistentmanner such that the underlying data have a structure amenable to use both as a reference knowledge base and as a computational resource for high-throughput querying and reuse. Pathways are represented in as much mechanistic detail as possible, detailing every established molecular event. Events are termed reactions but are not limited to classical biochemical events; binding, dissociation, and translocation between cellular compartments and all forms of posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, are also considered reactions.

On the Reactome Web site, pathways are organized hierarchically, following, where possible, the Gene Ontology Biological Process classification. The uppermost levels of the hierarchy represent broad topics in biology, such as the immune system, and serve to group together as subpathways the narrower topics contained within them. At lower hierarchical levels, the pathway topics become more focused and are represented in full molecular detail in interactive pathway diagrams. All pathways are represented as graphics with associated descriptions, literature references, and links to further annotation sources covering areas such as expression, structure, genetics, and disease. Reactome also provides analytic tools that can be used to submit a user data set for overrepresentation analysis, visualize expression data as an overlay on Reactome pathway graphics, or compare Reactome's human pathways with predicted pathways in model organisms.

### Pathway-based classification of lung cancer: a strategy to guide therapeutic selection [^116QBKzG]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

The critical challenge in virtually all cancer research is heterogeneity: "Breast cancer" and "lung cancer" are actually collections of disease with distinct molecular mechanisms and clinical characteristics. The challenge is evident in the complexity of most cancers with multiple mutations and alterations generating the cancer phenotype, requiring therapeutic strategies that can match the complexity with equally complex combination regimens. Substantial progress in treatment requires major advances in methods to define refined, "common mechanism" subgroups to allow development of combination therapeutics that target these individual mechanisms. Our work is on the use of genomic signatures of oncogenic signaling pathways that provide an opportunity to dissect the complexity of lung cancer and to serve as tools to direct the use of targeted therapeutic agents.

Correctly identifying perturbed biological pathways is a critical step in uncovering basic disease mechanisms and developing much-needed therapeutic strategies. However, whether current tools are optimal for unbiased discovery of relevant pathways remains unclear. Here, we create "Benchmark" to critically evaluate existing tools and find that most function sub-optimally. We thus develop the "Pathway Ensemble Tool" (PET), which outperforms existing methods. Deploying PET, we identify prognostic pathways across 12 cancer types. PET-identified prognostic pathways offer additional insights, with genes within these pathways serving as reliable biomarkers for clinical outcomes. Additionally, normalizing these pathways using drug repurposing strategies represents therapeutic opportunities. For example, the top predicted repurposed drug for bladder cancer, a CDK2/9 inhibitor, represses cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate that using Benchmark and PET for unbiased pathway discovery will offer additional insights into disease mechanisms across a spectrum of diseases, enabling biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies.

### Genetic analysis of biological pathway data through genomic randomization [^112z1QR2]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are a standard approach for large-scale common variation characterization and for identification of single loci predisposing to disease. However, due to issues of moderate sample sizes and particularly multiple testing correction, many variants of smaller effect size are not detected within a single allele analysis framework. Thus, small main effects and potential epistatic effects are not consistently observed in GWAS using standard analytical approaches that consider only single SNP alleles. Here, we propose unique methodology that aggregates variants of interest (for example, genes in a biological pathway) using GWAS results. Multiple testing and type I error concerns are minimized using empirical genomic randomization to estimate significance. Randomization corrects for common pathway-based analysis biases, such as SNP coverage and density, linkage disequilibrium, gene size and pathway size. Pathway Analysis by Randomization Incorporating Structure (PARIS) applies this randomization and in doing so directly accounts for linkage disequilibrium effects. PARIS is independent of association analysis method and is thus applicable to GWAS datasets of all study designs. Using the KEGG database as an example, we apply PARIS to the publicly available Autism Genetic Resource Exchange GWAS dataset, revealing pathways with a significant enrichment of positive association results.

### Interleukins and their signaling pathways in the reactome biological pathway database [^116o2tGh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is a wealth of biological pathway information available in the scientific literature, but it is spread across many thousands of publications. Alongside publications that contain definitive experimental discoveries are many others that have been dismissed as spurious, found to be irreproducible, or are contradicted by later results and consequently now considered controversial. Many descriptions and images of pathways are incomplete stylized representations that assume the reader is an expert and familiar with the established details of the process, which are consequently not fully explained. Pathway representations in publications frequently do not represent a complete, detailed, and unambiguous description of the molecules involved; their precise posttranslational state; or a full account of the molecular events they undergo while participating in a process. Although this might be sufficient to be interpreted by an expert reader, the lack of detail makes such pathways less useful and difficult to understand for anyone unfamiliar with the area and of limited use as the basis for computational models.

Objective

Reactome was established as a freely accessible knowledge base of human biological pathways. It is manually populated with interconnected molecular events that fully detail the molecular participants linked to published experimental data and background material by using a formal and open data structure that facilitates computational reuse. These data are accessible on a Web site in the form of pathway diagrams that have descriptive summaries and annotations and as downloadable data sets in several formats that can be reused with other computational tools. The entire database and all supporting software can be downloaded and reused under a Creative Commons license.

Methods

Pathways are authored by expert biologists who work with Reactome curators and editorial staff to represent the consensus in the field. Pathways are represented as interactive diagrams that include as much molecular detail as possible and are linked to literature citations that contain supporting experimental details. All newly created events undergo a peer-review process before they are added to the database and made available on the associated Web site. New content is added quarterly.

Results

The 63rd release of Reactome in December 2017 contains 10,996 human proteins participating in 11,426 events in 2,179 pathways. In addition, analytic tools allow data set submission for the identification and visualization of pathway enrichment and representation of expression profiles as an overlay on Reactome pathways. Protein-protein and compound-protein interactions from several sources, including custom user data sets, can be added to extend pathways. Pathway diagrams and analytic result displays can be downloaded as editable images, human-readable reports, and files in several standard formats that are suitable for computational reuse. Reactome content is available programmatically through a REpresentational State Transfer (REST)-based content service and as a Neo4J graph database. Signaling pathways for IL-1 to IL-38 are hierarchically classified within the pathway "signaling by interleukins". The classification used is largely derived from Akdis et al.

Conclusion

The addition to Reactome of a complete set of the known human interleukins, their receptors, and established signaling pathways linked to annotations of relevant aspects of immune function provides a significant computationally accessible resource of information about this important family. This information can be extended easily as new discoveries become accepted as the consensus in the field. A key aim for the future is to increase coverage of gene expression changes induced by interleukin signaling.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116vp65P]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis — overall management goals and care model include early intervention to prevent progression and a multidisciplinary, individualized approach: The main goal of screening high-risk groups is to implement early interventions and prevent the development of cirrhosis and liver-related and all-cause mortality; care must also be directed at reversing the unfavorable metabolic profile, as cardiovascular disease is the main driver of morbidity and mortality; in patients with NASH, the goal of liver-directed treatment is to reverse steatohepatitis and fibrosis, or at least halt fibrosis progression; the presence of steatosis largely serves as a biomarker or risk factor and should not be considered a treatment target per se; successful intervention requires a cohesive multidisciplinary team including the primary care physician, an endocrinologist, and gastroenterologist/hepatologist; we recommend that clinicians follow shared decision making to develop individualized treatment plans based on a patient's risk status.

### Sample multiplexing-based targeted pathway proteomics with real-time analytics reveals the impact of genetic variation on protein expression [^111ZfvzP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

A foundational principle of cellular biology is that a cell's genotype drives its phenotype. This link is mediated by the proteome, with variations in proteome status — often called the proteotype — governing phenotypes of all kinds that manifest as cellular function and dysfunction. Thus, a cell's proteotype encodes valuable insights into cellular function and clinical applications including disease diagnosis and progression monitoring. However, in order to extract these insights, approaches are needed to accurately and consistently profile the status of the proteome as well as account for variability at multiple levels including genetic diversity and environmental heterogeneity as well as technical variability. To overcome these hurdles, these approaches also need to contend with large numbers of samples.

To date, numerous targeted protein/pathway assays have been proposed for clinical uses, such as disease diagnosis and progression monitoring. Targeted pathway proteomics aims to explore families of proteins that represent entire signaling pathways and gene categories with minimal sample input and instrument time but with maximum coverage and reproducibility. Commonly, the measurements are obtained through dedicated acquisition of tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) of peptides across a chromatographic gradient — sometimes called parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Many dozens of peptides can be targeted in a single assay, and either retention-time scheduling or sequenced-matched, stable-isotope-labeled synthetic peptides are used as triggering events for the dedicated PRM and MS/MS scans.

### Integration of biological networks and pathways with genetic association studies [^112kMVwG]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Millions of genetic variants have been assessed for their effects on the trait of interest in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The complex traits are affected by a set of inter-related genes. However, the typical GWAS only examine the association of a single genetic variant at a time. The individual effects of a complex trait are usually small, and the simple sum of these individual effects may not reflect the holistic effect of the genetic system. High-throughput methods enable genomic studies to produce a large amount of data to expand the knowledge base of the biological systems. Biological networks and pathways are built to represent the functional or physical connectivity among genes. Integrated with GWAS data, the network- and pathway-based methods complement the approach of single genetic variant analysis, and may improve the power to identify trait-associated genes. Taking advantage of the biological knowledge, these approaches are valuable to interpret the functional role of the genetic variants, and to further understand the molecular mechanism influencing the traits. The network- and pathway-based methods have demonstrated their utilities, and will be increasingly important to address a number of challenges facing the mainstream GWAS.

### Typing tumors using pathways selected by somatic evolution [^1115aksF]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

While these meta-resources have been extremely useful, the high diversity of their contents motivates at least two major directions for further bioinformatics research. First, the effects of large numbers of non-specific interactions are not yet well understood. Is their inclusion in cancer pathway analyses helpful, neutral, or harmful? Second, it is not yet clear how to formulate molecular interaction networks that are both cancer-relevant and tissue-type specific. While various computational methods have been proposed to address tissue specificity, for instance by selecting interactions with tissue-specific gene expression patterns or functional annotations, similar strategies have not been devised for nominating interactions specific or relevant to cancer.

Here we show that, in fact, the informative pathways driving cancer pathogenesis and subtypes can be remarkably difficult to identify in the presence of many gene interactions irrelevant to cancer. We find that this problem can be at least partially addressed by creating a stringent filter on molecular interaction resources, based on patterns of mutually exclusive genetic alterations which arise during tumor evolution. We use the resulting cancer- and tissue-specific network, which we call the Evolutionarily Selected Pathway map, to analyze tumor genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium, resulting in a taxonomy of cancer pathways and subtypes associated with clinical outcomes.

### Ubiquitination in disease pathogenesis and treatment [^117AXyRR]. Nature Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Ubiquitination is crucial for a plethora of physiological processes, including cell survival and differentiation and innate and adaptive immunity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular action of ubiquitin in signaling pathways and how alterations in the ubiquitin system lead to the development of distinct human diseases. Here we describe the role of ubiquitination in the onset and progression of cancer, metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmunity, inflammatory disorders, infection and muscle dystrophies. Moreover, we indicate how current knowledge could be exploited for the development of new clinical therapies.

Future directions for PASC-CVD and PASC-CVS — both PASC-CVD and PASC-CVS may be encountered after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with varying effects on quality of life, and substantial opportunities exist to better understand their epidemiology, underlying mechanisms, and best approaches for evaluation and management. Little is currently known about the incidence of PASC in children, those with vaccine breakthrough infection, and those affected by newer SARS-CoV-2 variants (eg, Delta, Omicron), underscoring the need to conduct studies that leverage rigorous data collection and precise enrollment to define best practices for distinct phenotypes.

### LAGOS: learning health systems and how they can integrate with patient care [^113CdmbJ]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

To fulfil RS-EHR's aims the following LHS types from the LHS pathway, which apply to the levels of medical practice from the application pathway (in brackets), are needed:

Cohort identification — learning evidence (EBM) and operating within the context of the learning healthcare organisation level of the system pathway to identify a prescribed cohort of patients with similar health conditions or characteristics such as demographics and symptomatology consistent with the disease to be modelled and generated.
Positive deviance and negative deviance — learning evidence (EBM) and operating within the context of the learning healthcare organisation level of the system pathway; of commonly used treatments, both effective and ineffective to ensure synthetic patients receive realistic treatments and outcomes.
Predictive patient risk modelling — specific to patient (precision medicine) and operating within the LHS level of the system pathway to identify patterns and model risk factors consistent with adverse events.
Clinical decision support system — specific to patient (precision medicine) and operating within the LHS level of the system pathway to identify characteristics of synthetic patients that make them compatible for generation of specific disease or treatment outcomes.

LHS in the context of patient risk and decision modelling

There are numerous approaches for developing intelligent systems supporting clinical decision-making for diagnosis, prognosis or treatment selection. Bayesian networks (BNs) are one such approach. BNs model uncertainty and allow the user to update prior belief, such as when assessing the probability for presence of a medical condition in light of new evidence (additional symptoms, risk factors and test results). However, the process of building these intelligent systems for chronic conditions is not yet fully explored and understood. Chronic conditions are particularly challenging in this context as the patient's condition must be monitored for extended periods during which many decisions may be undertaken. Ideally, doctors and nurses should be able to monitor patients without the resource-intensive, expense and inconvenience of clinic visits, except when such visits are necessary. Current clinical records and care processes do not easily receive, integrate or enable patients in the home to collect and transmit self-monitoring data from inexpensive sensor-based devices like the Apple Watch and continuous glucose monitors.

### Mitochondrial signal transduction [^115z7YFk]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

To understand how mitochondria contribute to organismal health and disease, several important challenges remain. As reviewed above, the MIPS performs several functions that ensure rapid cellular and systemic responses commensurate with the energetic and biochemical state of the organism. As a result, mitochondria contribute to healthy cellular and physiological adaptation. Clinically, it is clear that mitochondrial diseases involve primary genetic defects affecting molecular processes other than the OxPhos machinery (i.e. not all mitochondrial diseases are disorders of ATP deficiency). Certain tissues and organs also specifically become affected, whereas others are relatively spared. How do non-energetic mitochondrial functions influence health and disease?

The three-step mitochondrial signal transduction framework described here raises several questions, some of which are listed below. Providing answers to these and other emerging questions would advance our understanding of the instructive role that the mitochondria play in human health. Because tissue-specific mitochondrial phenotypes (i.e. mitotypes) are the integrators of cell, tissue, and organismal metabolic inputs, and because MIPS outputs modulate not only a large fraction of the human genome but also complex animal behaviors, the following questions broadly concern the biological and biomedical sciences.

### Towards metabolomic-based precision approaches for classifying and treating Heart Failure [^115nV2XM]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac and noncardiac metabolism are central to the healthy myocardium; dysregulation of these central metabolic pathways has been found in many different types of HF and HF-related risk factors. Advances in high-throughput metabolomic profiling technologies have expanded our understanding simultaneously around the biology and related biomarkers underlying metabolism in HF. These advances have included a refined knowledge of substrate utilization pathways but also identification of novel metabolic pathways. With our growing knowledge of the complex interplay among the liver, adipose tissue, vasculature, and skeletal muscle with myocardium in promoting or mitigating HF, more studies are needed that leverage metabolomic profiling including emerging techniques for in vivo evaluation of flux and fate in multiple tissues.

Circulating markers reflecting cardiac and noncardiac dysregulation of these pathways show great promise as diagnostic, prognostic, and subclassification biomarkers. Importantly, many of these pathways and related biomarkers are beneficially modifiable to known and emerging HF therapies suggesting their potential for use in more personalized and precise approaches to HF management. One could imagine a day when patients undergo measurement of multiple metabolites in blood to understand their future HF and HF-related adverse risk, to have more precise subclassification for personalized therapeutics as is currently the paradigm in precision oncology, and for monitoring of precision therapeutic strategies. However, despite the incredible advances detailed in this review, much work is needed to bridge the gap between discovery and patient care. Development of point-of-care testing, biomarker-guided trials, implementation studies building patient-facing protocols evaluating efficacy and effectiveness of biomarker-guided strategies, and dissemination efforts are necessary to realize the full potential of metabolomics in a more personalized approach to HF care. Regardless, metabolomic profiling as a tool has significantly changed our understanding of HF over the past decade and holds great potential in improving the care of patients with, and at risk of, HF.

### A framework for pathway knowledge driven prioritization in genome-wide association studies [^113X4T4J]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that prespecifying a set of "important pathways" based on subjective knowledge can lead to huge power loss when the candidate pathways turn out to be incorrect (Roeder, Devlin, & Wasserman, 2007). Ideally the relative importance of pathways should be automatically determined from the GWAS data. Given GWAS results, it is possible to map SNPs onto genes and then conduct pathway enrichment analysis (Wang, Li, & Hakonarson, 2010) or network analysis (Jia & Zhao, 2014) to biologically interpret findings. However, such post hoc enrichment analysis does not lead to discovery of additional (novel) SNPs beyond those with p values below genome‐wide significance threshold. For this, we need a pathway‐guided GWAS strategy that can help discover more SNPs by improving the statistical power of detection. Some existing methods allow incorporation of pathways in GWAS analysis using Bayesian models to achieve prioritization and return posteriors or Bayes factors as output (e.g. Bush, Dudek, & Ritchie, 2009; Carbonetto & Stephens, 2013; Chen & Thomas, 2010; Lee, Blom, Wang, Shim, & Marcotte, 2011). Here, we develop a generic framework for pathway‐based prioritization that allows the user to adhere to the usual p value threshold for genome‐wide significance. Pathway‐guided GWAS can be particularly useful for secondary reweighted analysis of GWAS data for making additional discoveries. The method is specifically designed to be able to incorporate knowledge from a large number of pathways in a scalable computationally efficient manner. Further, it is easy to implement in any statistical software package making it accessible for routine use by the community.

### Unbiased discovery of cancer pathways and therapeutics using pathway ensemble tool and benchmark [^112GjDk4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The contemporary investigation of the underlying mechanisms in cancer relies disproportionately on obtaining genome-wide omics data. Biological pathway analysis is a crucial tool in interpreting these data. As such, several pathway analysis methods have been developed, with the implicit assumption that they identify and prioritize the most important pathways among their top-ranked outputs (reviewed here). Indeed, these methods have been successful in confirming some of the speculated and/or dysregulated pathways. Many of these methods have also been tested on simulated dataor anecdotally verified in small scale biological datasets. However, the performance and limitations of these methods for an unbiased discovery of related biological pathways has been largely unknown.

Here, we developed a platform named Benchmark to explicitly measure performance of pathway analysis tools for discovery under experimental settings. It is worth noting that Benchmark has several key advantageous features, making it superior to existing gold-standard evaluation platforms. First, IGSs and TGSs that are used for evaluation in Benchmark are derived from large numbers (~1000) of experimental datasets, where expected pathways are well-defined. This is in clear contrast to the few existing evaluation platforms that utilize small experimental datasets, computer-simulated pathways, and/or subjective measures for defining pathways. Second, since IGSs and TGSs in Benchmark are derived from experimental data, they eliminate systematic biases introduced by computer simulations. For example, IGSs and TGSs in Benchmark are free from biases introduced due to the assumption by most simulations that genes within each pathway are independent of each other. Third, IGSs and TGSs recapitulate a realistic setting where genesets under investigation (i.e. IGSs) are often derived under conditions (e.g. cell lines, species, conditions) that are different from those of known biological pathways (TGSs). Fourth, because Benchmark uses experimental data, it contains noise inherent to biological data, therefore provides a platform for a faithful readout of the performances of pathway analysis tools under real-life settings. Lastly, we present two evaluation measures, namely P@10 and AP@10, which accurately reflect the practical application of pathway analysis methods for biologists.

### Predicting and affecting response to cancer therapy based on pathway-level biomarkers [^112C7vtQ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

One can consider biomarkers that are based on pathway-level activities as a way of combining and improving the performance of multiple gene-level biomarkers, and thus increasing the confidence and accuracy of therapeutic decision-making in the clinic. Importantly, biomarkers can provide guidance on which patients to treat, or not treat, with a specific drug. It is also possible that pathway-level biomarkers may turn out to be more powerful exclusion, rather than inclusion, criteria for some therapies.

RNAi therapy is an emerging approach for achieving precision cancer therapyand could potentially be used to follow-up on biomarkers found by pathway analysis. Since our data show that the analysis of pathways can predict biological responses, it is reasonable to consider that this type of analysis will yield good candidate pathways for RNAi therapy. Our analysis of RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 screens identified novel genes in multiple tissue types that may not only serve as predictive biomarkers for response to different drugs but also as potential therapeutic targets.

It is important to note that one limitation of our biomarker discovery approach is that the activity of pathways is not always regulated, or at least not always reflected, by mRNA abundance. Indeed, regulation of protein translation and different post-translational modifications (e.g. protein phosphorylation) can commonly affect protein activity levels and the resulting pathway activities. For pathways in which the activity level is not reflected by changes in the expression patterns of the pathways' members, our analysis will be underpowered and likely miss a potential association with response, resulting in false-negative results. We speculate that the activity of pathways controlled by transcription factors may be easier to detect by gene expression data. Nevertheless, even classic signaling pathways that propel the signaling flux along the pathway via post-translational modification events commonly affect downstream transcriptional activity, and thus may also be detected by mRNA expression data.

### Switching between biologics and biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease [^113TyTSx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Biosimilars — definitions, molecular variability, and FDA approval pathways are outlined as follows: Biosimilars are not simply generic versions of biologic therapies; generic drugs are identical to their reference product whereas biosimilars are highly similar but not identical to their reference product, and biologic treatments are derived from a living source with a precise structure that is difficult to fully characterize. The number of steps required to produce a biologic introduces opportunities for variation, manufacturing differences can affect biologic properties and immunogenicity, and although highly similar, biosimilars are not identical so the approval pathway for biosimilars is different from that for generics. Biologic therapies are approved under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), amended through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI); biologic therapies require submission of clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy for FDA approval (351(a) pathway), whereas biosimilars are not required to follow this same pathway and are offered an abbreviated pathway for approval, and the BPCI allows an abbreviated licensure pathway for products demonstrated to be "biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed biological reference product".

### A framework for pathway knowledge driven prioritization in genome-wide association studies [^115y1q7F]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

We have incorporated gene‐level prior knowledge only. Our method is not comparable to the existing prioritization methods. To our knowledge, no existing method incorporates gene‐level priors (e.g. pathways) using a conventional p value threshold approach. Second, we have developed a statistically powerful method simply from pathway knowledge (gene‐level knowledge), without the use of more detailed information such as SNP‐level annotations. Existing SNP prioritization methods make assumptions such as "one true SNP per region" to identify causal variants, so they are not applicable (without modifications) in our context, that is, discovery of "associated SNPs" using gene‐level priors. In the future, a careful study of SNP‐level annotations and pathways would be required to understand the best way of combining these two sources of information in a scalable manner.

The list of pathways supplied to our method should generally not be restricted to "candidate pathways" thought to be important for the disease under study. An unbiased list of pathways or "gene sets" (possibly a large number) representing meaningful biological categories may be supplied. Depending on a disease context, important categories of genes (e.g. cancer related genes in a cancer GWAS) may be added to the pool of annotations to potentially improve power. However, restricting genes (e.g. removing noncancer genes from annotations) can reduce power. Also, it should be recognized that reweighted analysis of a GWAS data set is as likely as the original GWAS to yield a false‐positive finding. The chance of making a false‐positive discovery is further enhanced if an investigator explores multiple annotation databases until a discovery is made. To guard against such false‐positives, we recommend that an investigator should predetermine the annotations to be used and also follow stringent criteria for replication and validation to confirm a novel finding.

In conclusion, we have provided a framework and have developed a method that can enable routine use of pathway and other gene‐level annotations for prioritization in GWAS. Pathway‐guided GWAS can be effectively used in practice for secondary reweighted GWA scan to make additional discoveries beyond those revealed by the primary unbiased GWAS analysis. Our method allows flexibility to investigators to either use standard pathway or ontology databases or define their own gene sets. Being modular in nature, it allows for future extensions to more genomic data types and bioinformatic knowledge from multiple sources.

### Pathway and network analysis of more than 2500 whole cancer genomes [^112uJBqN]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Because of limited power in individual cancer types, our pathway and network analysis focused on associations found across cancer and tissue types. Thus, we primarily utilized generic, tissue-independent network and pathway information. However, it is well known that gene–gene interactions vary across tissues and that cancer cells rewire signaling and regulatory networks. Future investigations that consider the variable landscape of regulatory and physical interactions across tissues may offer a new perspective on the data. Specifically, each cell type has a different epigenetic wiring and regulatory machinery, and non-coding mutations may target cell type-dependent vulnerabilities. Approaches that incorporate tissue-specific, cancer-specific, or patient-specific gene–gene regulatory information may reveal new classes of drivers unexplored with our current approaches.

Our pathway- and network-driven strategies enable us to interpret the coding and non-coding landscape of tumor genomes to discover driver mechanisms in interconnected systems of genes. This approach has multiple benefits. First, by broadening our mutation analysis from single genomic elements to pathways and networks of multiple genes, we identify new components of known cancer pathways that are recurrently altered by both coding and non-coding mutations, and thus likely to be important in cancer. Second, we identify new pathways and subnetworks that would remain unseen in an analysis focusing on coding sequences. Investigation of the coding and non-coding mutations that perturb these pathways and networks will enable more accurate patient-stratification strategies, pathway-focused biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches.

### Lipidomics and metabolomics as potential biomarkers for breast cancer progression [^116MZmUy]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolomic biomarkers of breast cancer progression

Metabolic processes shape the functional dynamics of cancer cells and their progression. Metabolomics, the study of these processes, offers a precise method to understand how physiological conditions relate to both external influences and diseases. Metabolites are particularly useful in this context because they act as immediate indicators of disease processes and can serve as direct biomarkers reflecting pathogenic activities. Metabolomics provides an intricate and comprehensive view of biological processes and metabolic pathways, positioning it as a potentially pivotal tool in precision medicine for offering a precise and objective molecular-level analysis. This omic technique further provides direct readouts, through metabolic maps and profiles, that have the potential to predict metabolic states ranging from the cellular level to the organ of interest.

Recent innovations in highly sensitive, low-input assays allow for detailed profiling of the metabolome and lipidome from minimal amounts of biological samples, which is revolutionizing the use of lipidomics and metabolomics as biomarkers for tracking the progression of diseases such as breast cancer. In cancer, fundamental shifts in metabolic pathways have been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in mouse and patient samples. For instance, cancer cells have been shown to capitalize on glucose uptake and downstream shifts in metabolic processes to provide maximal cellular fuel to maintain cancer cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, tumors are dependent on metabolites to sustain growth and survival, and are able to adapt nutrient usage in response to the nutrient availability.

### A precise thymalfasin-regulated PRaG regimen for advanced refractory solid tumors: an open-label, prospective, multicenter clinical study (PRaG 5.0 study) [^111aEeML]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods: Subjects with advanced solid tumors, having progressed beyond at least first-line chemotherapy, were eligible and treated with thymalfasin at three doses, dependent on the baseline absolute T lymphocyte count. Following seven days of thymalfasin treatment in patients with low baseline lymphocytes, they received at least two cycles of the PRaG regimen until either no suitable lesions remained for irradiation or the normal tissue tolerance dose was reached. When completing PRaG cycles, patients were maintained PD-1 inhibitor and thymalfasin until disease progression or intolerable adverse events. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate according to RECIST 1.

1. Peripheral blood samples were collected for subsequent translational research.

+T cells, the intermediate state between the naïve-like and the effector-memory subsets, increased post-treatment, especially in three responders with PR and SD after two cycles of PRaG and thymalfasin, while a CD8 +terminally exhausted cluster showed a decreasing trend in these responders. Seventy-six differential genes were identified in early-activated CD8. +T cells, mainly enriched in activation of immune response, myeloid leukocyte activation, and T cell receptor signaling pathways. CCL3, PTPRC, NFKBIA, FOSB, RELB, and TGFB1 were vital genes in the gene network analysis. Conclusions: The preliminary results of the PRaG 5. 0 regimen revealed a manageable safety profile and encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of thymalfasin modulation appeared to increase in early-activated CD8.

### Unilateral light-near dissociation in lesions of the rostral midbrain… [^111Efmbn]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Diagram showing the neural circuitry thought to account for the pupillary light reflex. We state that the pupil pathways illustrated, although not proven anatomically, reflect our attempt to logically account for the various clinical observations that are made with lesions in this area. A midline lesion of the posterior commissure, shown in pink, interrupts most projections from both PON, causing bilateral symmetric loss of the PLR with preservation of the near response. It is suspected that the near-reflex fibers approach the Edinger-Westphal nucleus through the ventral region, unlike the afferent retinal light-reflex fibers that follow a dorsal route. A summary of the pupil findings expected for lesions placed at different locations within the PLR pathway is given in Table 1 and also shown in Figure 3. We suggest that 3 patterns of pupil abnormality may be found in association with rostral midbrain lesions.

We state that anatomical confirmation of many parts of the pupil pathway shown in Figure 3 still do not exist and merely reflects our attempt to logically account for the various clinical observations that are made with lesions in this area. We have shown 2 possible routes by which this may be achieved — either there is a double decussation through the posterior commissure or there is a direct uncrossed projection from the PON to the ipsilateral EWN. There is no anatomical or clinical evidence to distinguish these 2 routes, and so we have shown both by dashed lines in Figure 3.

This conclusion is supported both by the physiological evidence 7 and by the anatomical evidence 8 and presumably accounts for the normal phenomenon of contraction anisocoria.
9. Careful assessment of the pupil signs in patients with rostral midbrain pathology, paying particular attention to the symmetry between the 2 eyes, may therefore allow more precise localization of the lesion than was hitherto suspected.

Access to human kidney biopsy tissue is a critical first step to define disease heterogeneity and determine the precise molecular pathways that will facilitate identification of specific drug targets and ultimately enable individualized care for people with AKI and CKD. A number of research centers across the United States are collaborating to bring state-of-the-art technologies together to:

- Ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD
- Define disease subgroups
- Create a kidney tissue atlas
- Identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies The KPMP is made up of three distinct, but highly interactive, activity groups:

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project is a prospective cohort study, whose goal is to use deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies, along with longitudinally collected clinical phenotypic data, in order to develop new disease ontologies, classification systems, and treatments for acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Since its inception, the KPMP has sought out and included substantive patient-representative feedback regarding disease experience, lack of innovation in new kidney disease therapies and patient tolerance for risk levels in balance with potential benefits both to the individual and society. Molecular and imaging data derived from kidney tissue will be integrated with clinico-pathologic and genetic information, as well as other data derived from analyses of fluid biospecimens, including peripheral blood, urine, and stool.

Using advanced analytics to integrate the data, KPMP will aim to define kidney disease subgroups in molecular terms by identifying critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies. For each participant, kidney tissue will be obtained for molecular phenotyping and clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic interpretation will be returned to the participant's primary caregiver to inform clinical care, but no treatment interventions will be prescribed by the KPMP. In addition to kidney biopsy, the study will involve collection of baseline and longitudinal biospecimens and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Participants will be followed through scheduled in-person and remote study visits, as well as through periodic review of electronic health records.

Despite significant effort from industry and academia, development of pharmacologic therapies for AKI and CKD has been hampered by: Non-predictive animal models The inability to identify and prioritize human targets The limited availability of human kidney biopsy tissue A poor understanding of AKI and CKD heterogeneity Historically, AKI and CKD have been described as single, uniform diseases. However, growing consensus suggests that different disease pathways lead to different subgroups of AKI and CKD. Access to human kidney biopsy tissue is a critical first step to define disease heterogeneity and determine the precise molecular pathways that will facilitate identification of specific drug targets and ultimately enable individualized care for people with AKI and CKD. A number of research centers across the United States are collaborating to bring state-of-the-art technologies together to:

Ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD Define disease subgroups Create a kidney tissue atlas Identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies The KPMP is made up of three distinct, but highly interactive, activity groups: Recruitment Sites: The recruitment sites are responsible for recruiting participants with AKI or CKD into the longitudinal study and performing the kidney biopsy. Since its inception, KPMP has developed sophisticated protocols for collection and analysis of human kidney tissue, and for collection of biofluids. Members of the consortium have wide-ranging expertise in conducting clinical studies, processing kidney tissue, advanced structural and molecular analysis and complex bioinformatics analysis, which will be used to to leverage effectively as a group to better understand kidney disease.
