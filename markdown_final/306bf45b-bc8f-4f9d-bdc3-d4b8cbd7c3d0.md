## Question

Diabetes type 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically seeking a comprehensive overview of its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, screening strategies, clinical presentation, complications, management principles (including lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and individualized targets), as well as considerations for precision medicine, mental health integration, prevention, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and pathophysiology to anchor the clinical frame. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors to contextualize screening. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and screening strategies, including special populations. After that, I need to examine clinical presentation and complications. Then, I will outline management principles, including lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and individualized targets. I should also consider precision medicine and mental health integration. Finally, I will address prevention, special populations, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and a relative insulin secretory deficiency, leading to chronic hyperglycemia; the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental drivers, especially obesity and inactivity, underpins this dysregulation, with hepatic overproduction of glucose and impaired peripheral uptake contributing to hyperglycemia as β-cell function wanes over time.

> I should double-check the epidemiology to calibrate screening thresholds and urgency. Globally, T2DM accounts for roughly 90–95% of diabetes, with over 500 million people affected and substantial undiagnosed burden; in the US, about 38.4 million adults have diabetes, 8.7 million are undiagnosed, and 97.6 million have prediabetes, with marked racial/ethnic disparities and a high prevalence among older adults, while youth-onset T2DM is rising rapidly, particularly in certain minority populations [^111nGsr2] [^116e3fLx].

> Hold on, I should verify risk factors and screening indications before proposing testing. Overweight/obesity, especially visceral adiposity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, advancing age, family history, prior gestational diabetes, PCOS, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain racial/ethnic groups elevate risk; ADA recommends screening all adults beginning at age 35, and earlier or more frequently in those with overweight/obesity plus additional risk factors, using fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour OGTT, or A1C, with confirmatory testing when hyperglycemia is not unequivocal [^112KhzHP] [^111EatXH] [^115oeite].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric nuances because adult algorithms don't translate directly. For children and adolescents, the USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient for universal screening, but ADA supports risk-based screening in youth with overweight/obesity and additional risk factors, starting after age 10 or at puberty, repeating at least every 3 years; notably, DKA can occur at presentation in youth with T2DM, and marked hyperglycemia may warrant initial insulin plus metformin [^117Uh7tX] [^113LTc1a] [^114QRaS4].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and ensure I'm precise. Diabetes can be diagnosed by A1C ≥ 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during a 75-g OGTT, or random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of classic symptoms. Confirmatory testing is needed in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, and in adults without classic T2DM risk factors or at younger ages, islet autoantibody testing can help exclude autoimmune diabetes [^114kB3Pu] [^115oeite] [^1158UKaE].

> I will now examine clinical presentation and the natural history to avoid missing silent disease. Many individuals are asymptomatic for years; when symptomatic, polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, recurrent infections, and delayed wound healing are common, and neuropathic pain or paresthesias may emerge; importantly, symptom burden is substantial across the disease course and rises near end of life, and cardiovascular disease may be silent or atypical in diabetes, warranting vigilance [^1135HAvP] [^116PRxWQ] [^116Ay3yd].

> Let me consider complications next, because they drive targets and follow-up intensity. Microvascular complications include retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, while macrovascular disease manifests as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and stroke. Autonomic neuropathy can cause orthostasis, gastroparesis, and erectile dysfunction, and foot complications are common, so annual foot risk assessment and neuropathy screening are essential [^1135HAvP] [^111xSKMJ] [^111SU9jF].

> I need to ensure management principles are patient-centered and evidence-based. Lifestyle therapy with weight loss, dietary patterns emphasizing whole foods and fiber, and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity are foundational; pharmacotherapy should be individualized to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences, with metformin as first-line unless contraindicated, and escalation to combination therapy when A1C is ≥ 1.5% above goal; for severe hyperglycemia or symptomatic presentation, insulin initiation is appropriate, and newer agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors confer cardiorenal benefits beyond glycemia [^113aJx7e] [^111o3WxT] [^113ayVRd].

> But wait, what about glycemic targets — should I default to a single A1C goal for everyone? I should confirm individualized targets: ADA suggests < 7% for many nonpregnant adults, with consideration of < 6.5% if safely achievable, while ACP recommends 7–8% for most adults and deintensification below 6.5%; in older or frail adults, less stringent targets are reasonable to minimize hypoglycemia and burden, and in youth, early, aggressive control may be warranted given rapid progression [^113A6kBq] [^111E6yVH] [^114QRaS4].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiorenal protection specifics so I don't overgeneralize. In patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist reduces major adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes irrespective of baseline A1C, and this should be prioritized independent of background therapy; clinicians should also counsel on SGLT2-associated euglycemic DKA risk and provide ketone education when indicated [^113ayVRd] [^117FgVQm].

> I need to check mental health integration because it meaningfully affects outcomes. Depression and anxiety are common in diabetes and are associated with worse adherence and outcomes; ADA recommends annual depression screening and consideration of anxiety screening, with referral to behavioral health as indicated; diabetes distress is prevalent, though evidence for universal screening tools is limited, so clinical judgment is key [^115bHWoy] [^114v7Gmk] [^113cHPTJ].

> Let me reconsider precision medicine claims so I don't overstate current utility. While T2DM shows clinically meaningful heterogeneity and machine learning or genomic approaches can identify reproducible subtypes linked to outcomes, translation to routine clinical care remains early-stage; nonetheless, phenotype-guided therapy — such as favoring GLP-1 agents in obesity or SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD/HF — is increasingly pragmatic and aligned with modern guidelines [^1131WC3h] [^116JAcvf] [^113aJx7e].

> Next, I should review prevention because upstream risk modification changes incidence. Intensive lifestyle interventions reduce progression from prediabetes to diabetes by about 58%, and metformin offers a modest benefit in high-risk individuals. Population-level obesity strategies are critical, and structured programs targeting diet, activity, and weight are first-line for those with prediabetes [^116dh1sC].

> I should double-check special populations and practical implementation details. In older adults, individualize targets, screen for geriatric syndromes, and prioritize quality of life; in pregnancy, screen early for gestational diabetes and manage per obstetric protocols; in hospitalized patients, use basal-bolus insulin for persistent hyperglycemia; and in resource-limited settings, align care with tiered standards of care to ensure feasibility and equity [^111E6yVH] [^111CTNGJ].

> Finally, let me summarize to ensure coherence and completeness. T2DM is a heterogeneous, progressive disease driven by insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Early detection via risk-based screening, confirmation with standard criteria, and comprehensive, patient-centered management — including lifestyle, metformin-first pharmacotherapy, and cardiorenal-protective agents — are essential. Individualized A1C targets, proactive mental health care, and attention to complications and special populations improve outcomes, while prevention efforts and precision approaches offer promising paths to bend the curve of the epidemic [^1135HAvP] [^114kB3Pu] [^113aJx7e] [^111nGsr2].

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by **insulin resistance** and progressive β-cell dysfunction, leading to hyperglycemia [^1135HAvP]. It accounts for ~90% of diabetes cases and is driven by obesity, inactivity, and genetic susceptibility [^111nGsr2] [^112mEZJj]. Diagnosis relies on **A1C ≥ 6.5%**, fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or 2-hour glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during OGTT, with confirmatory testing unless hyperglycemia is unequivocal [^114kB3Pu] [^115oeite]. Management centers on lifestyle change, metformin first-line, and **cardiorenal risk–guided therapy** (GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors) [^113aJx7e] [^113ayVRd]; insulin is added when A1C is ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [^111sf3fo] [^111o3WxT]. Early, individualized care reduces microvascular and macrovascular complications and improves outcomes [^112mEZJj] [^1135HAvP].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Insulin resistance**: Reduced responsiveness of muscle, fat, and liver to insulin, causing hyperglycemia [^1135HAvP] [^114eBpZJ].
- **Β-cell dysfunction**: Progressive loss of insulin secretion, worsening hyperglycemia over time [^1135HAvP] [^114eBpZJ].
- **Genetic and environmental factors**: Polygenic predisposition plus obesity, inactivity, and diet drive risk [^1135HAvP] [^112m4wKQ].

---

## Risk factors

- **Obesity**: Central adiposity is the strongest modifiable risk factor [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].
- **Physical inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyle increases risk [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].
- **Age**: Risk rises with age, especially ≥ 45 years [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].
- **Family history**: First-degree relatives have higher risk [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].
- **Ethnicity**: Higher prevalence in African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, and Native American populations [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].
- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, dyslipidemia, PCOS, and gestational diabetes increase risk [^1135HAvP] [^1158UKaE].

---

## Clinical presentation

Often asymptomatic and detected on screening; when symptomatic, patients may have **polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing, and recurrent infections** [^1135HAvP]. Classic symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, blurred vision, slow wound healing, and recurrent infections [^1135HAvP].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

| **Test** | **Diagnostic threshold** |
|-|-|
| HbA1c | ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) |
| Fasting plasma glucose | ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour plasma glucose (OGTT) | ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) |
| Random plasma glucose | ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with classic symptoms |

---

Confirmatory testing is required unless **hyperglycemia is unequivocal** [^115oeite].

---

## Complications

### Microvascular complications

Microvascular complications include **retinopathy**, which can lead to blindness; **nephropathy**, which may progress to end-stage renal disease; and **neuropathy**, which causes sensory loss and increases the risk of ulcers and amputation [^1135HAvP] [^114eBpZJ].

---

### Macrovascular complications

Macrovascular complications include **cardiovascular disease** — coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease — and **heart failure**, which is more common and associated with worse outcomes [^1135HAvP] [^111fau3s].

---

## Management

### Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions include **weight loss** of 5–10% to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, and a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and reduced saturated fats [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **First-line**: Metformin unless contraindicated [^115TcJLY].
- **Second-line**: GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors based on cardiorenal risk [^113ayVRd].
- **Insulin**: Initiate when A1C ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, or if symptomatic hyperglycemia [^111sf3fo] [^111o3WxT].

---

### Individualized treatment targets

Individualized treatment targets emphasize **A1C targets** tailored to age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk, and **blood pressure and lipid control** to reduce cardiovascular risk [^116Tc2ws] [^116Czxj6].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **lifestyle modification** — weight loss, physical activity, and dietary change to delay or prevent T2D in high-risk individuals — and, in select high-risk patients, metformin may be considered [^113vAJuh].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **glycemic control** — better control reduces complications and improves survival — and on **complication burden**, as cardiovascular and renal disease significantly worsen outcomes [^1135HAvP].

---

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive β-cell dysfunction, with **management centered on lifestyle, metformin, and cardiorenal risk–guided therapy** to reduce complications and improve outcomes [^1135HAvP] [^113aJx7e].

### Psychosocial factors and glycemic control in young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes [^115bHxWo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Outcomes in type 2 diabetes are heavily determined by self-management behaviors that often affect glycemic control. Several studies seek to identify psychosocial factors associated with glycemic control, commonly defined by hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels. Psychosocial factors studied include depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, diabetes distress, social support, self-efficacy, and social determinants of health. Significant factors might serve as targets of behavioral interventions to improve outcomes. However, the evidence of associations between these factors and HbA 1c is mixed; the available studies were mostly cross-sectional, and participants were middle-aged to older adults with adult-onset type 2 diabetes (diagnosed after age 18 years).

There has been a marked increase in the incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (diagnosed before age 18 years). Compared with adult-onset diabetes, youth-onset diabetes is associated with poorer health outcomes, including earlier onset and severity of diabetes-related complications. Developmental, social, and emotional challenges among this cohort make it difficult to generalize from existing research on older adults. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study recruited a large, diverse sample of 699 children and adolescents with youth-onset type 2 diabetes to participate in a randomized clinical trial to evaluate 3 treatment regimens. Following the TODAY intervention study, 572 participants enrolled in the TODAY2 observational follow-up study of a unique cohort (ie, young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes). Looking at one psychosocial factor (depression) and HbA 1c, 14.8% of TODAY youth participants reported clinically significant depression symptoms, but symptoms were not associated with HbA 1c. Over the last 6 years of the TODAY2 study when participants moved into adulthood, the percentage of participants with significant depression symptoms increased (from 14.0% to 19.2%) and symptoms were associated with higher HbA 1c, hypertension, and progression of retinopathy.

Conclusions

There have been multiple changes in the care of people with type 2 diabetes over the last 15 years, with much to be optimistic about given the development of better ways to prevent, reverse or treat diabetes and thus avoid its major complications. That noted, the biggest challenge remains the increasing number of people worldwide who are overweight or obese, leading to an inevitable rise in type 2 diabetes rates in nearly all countries. Yet, I and many others believe that the obesity epidemic cannot be solved by the medical profession but only by governments. However, few, if any, national governments appear to take these issues seriously. The increasing number of younger people with type 2 diabetes is a particular cause for concern because the condition worsens more rapidly in younger people, leading to greater life years lost. In high-income countries, the other challenge that paradoxically arises from our improved ability to prevent premature deaths from CVD, cancer and other chronic conditions, is that more people with such conditions are living longer and thus able to develop type 2 diabetes. At the same time, improved survival in diabetes per se gives these patients more time to develop other chronic conditions. The consequence is a rise in the number of people with comorbidity – an issue set to add to the complexities of diabetes care in the future. Finally, the rapid rise in diabetes rates in many low and middle-income countries challenges many health systems worldwide. Sadly, a lack of resources, including drugs, plus too few trained healthcare professionals and a lack of integrated care systems, means that diabetes is set to become a far more common cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1135HAvP]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetes mellitus type 2:
- **Definition**: T2DM is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and a relative deficiency in insulin secretion, leading to chronic hyperglycemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of T2DM involves a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that disrupt normal glucose regulation. A key feature is insulin resistance, in which body tissues become less responsive to insulin. To compensate, pancreatic β-cells initially increase insulin production, but this response gradually declines, leading to β-cell dysfunction and insufficient insulin secretion. As a result, hepatic glucose production increases, and glucose uptake by peripheral tissues decreases, causing impaired glucose regulation and eventually chronic hyperglycemia.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, an estimated 38.4 million Americans (11.6% of the population) were living with diabetes. Of these, 29.7 million had been diagnosed, while 8.7 million remained undiagnosed. Approximately 2 million Americans had T1DM, including about 304,000 children and adolescents. Among adults aged 65 years and older, diabetes prevalence was particularly high at 29.2% (16.5 million people). Each year, an additional 1.2 million Americans receive a new diabetes diagnosis. Moreover, 97.6 million adults had prediabetes, placing them at elevated risk for developing diabetes. In youth under 20, about 352,000 individuals (0.35%) were living with diagnosed diabetes; between 2017 and 2018, the annual incidence was 18,200 for type 1 and 5,300 for T2DM. Marked racial and ethnic disparities persist, with the highest rates among American Indian/Alaska Native (13.6%), non-Hispanic Black (12.1%), and Hispanic (11.7%) adults, compared with Asian American (9.1%) and non-Hispanic White (6.9%) adults.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for T2DM include overweight or obesity, especially abdominal fat, which leads to insulin resistance. Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, advancing age, and a family history of diabetes further increase risk. The condition is more common among African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American populations. Other contributing factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia, PCOS, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes. Chronic stress, poor sleep, and certain medications such as glucocorticoids may also raise the risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of T2DM develop gradually, often beginning with a long asymptomatic period during which the disease is present but undiagnosed. Many individuals remain asymptomatic for years, with the condition discovered incidentally during routine testing. As the disease progresses, classic symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision may appear. Recurrent infections, slow wound healing, and numbness or tingling in the extremities can also occur as a result of hyperglycemia and peripheral neuropathy. The clinical course is typically chronic and progressive, with β-cell function declining over time. Without proper management, long-term complications develop, including CVD, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, which can significantly affect QoL and life expectancy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis and survival in T2DM depend on the degree of metabolic control and the presence of complications. Individuals who achieve good control of blood glucose, BP, and lipid levels can maintain near-normal life expectancy, while those with poorly controlled diabetes or advanced cardiovascular and renal complications face significantly higher mortality. CVD remains the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. In 2021, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in the US, listed as the underlying cause on 103,294 death certificates and mentioned as a contributing cause on a total of 399,401. Overall, life expectancy may be reduced by 5 to 10 years in individuals with longstanding or uncontrolled disease, but adherence to lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and regular follow-up can substantially improve both survival and QoL.

### Diagnosing type 2 diabetes before patients complain of diabetic symptoms – clinical opportunistic screening in a single general practice [^111M9bhG]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a disease of international importance. It is increasing in prevalence, is a lifelong condition, is associated with serious complications and shorter life expectation. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) forms 90% of new diagnoses. Most diagnoses of diabetes are now made in general practice, and over two-thirds of patients with diabetes are now managed in general practice. Diabetes has therefore become a disease of general practice. Treatment can only follow diagnosis, so an important research question is how early in the disease can the diagnosis be made?

### Type 2 diabetes and obesity: genomics and the clinic [^11297Vbz]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity represent major challenges for global public health. They are at the forefront of international efforts to identify the genetic variation contributing to complex disease susceptibility, and recent years have seen considerable success in identifying common risk-variants. Given the clinical impact of molecular diagnostics in rarer monogenic forms of these diseases, expectations have been high that genetic discoveries will transform the prospects for risk stratification, development of novel therapeutics and personalised medicine. However, so far, clinical translation has been limited. Difficulties in defining the alleles and transcripts mediating association effects have frustrated efforts to gain early biological insights, whilst the fact that variants identified account for only a modest proportion of observed familiarity has limited their value in guiding treatment of individual patients. Ongoing efforts to track causal variants through fine-mapping and to illuminate the biological mechanisms through which they act, as well as sequence-based discovery of lower-frequency alleles (of potentially larger effect), should provide welcome acceleration in the capacity for clinical translation. This review will summarise recent advances in identifying risk alleles for T2D and obesity, and existing contributions to understanding disease pathology. It will consider the progress made in translating genetic knowledge into clinical utility, the challenges remaining, and the realistic potential for further progress.

### Web-based depression treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized, controlled trial [^112nAvf8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Comorbid depression is common in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, adversely affecting quality of life, diabetes outcomes, and mortality. Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up.

RESULTS

The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P < 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P < 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P < 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS

Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.

### Impact of type 2 diabetes on lower urinary tract symptoms in men: a cohort study [^112mo4b3]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus, lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia are all common disorders that affect men as they age. It is well known that diabetes can negatively impact the bladder and is manifested in later stages as diabetic cystopathy. It is less clear, however, how diabetes affects the more common lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) of the aging male.

Early studies reported that diabetes was associated with surgery for enlarged prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As recently reviewed by Sarma and Parsons, most studies determined that type 2 diabetes is associated with a 10–200% increase in the risk of LUTS. However, these studies were quite variable in the way they defined LUTS; for example, the definitions frequently included various markers of BPH, such as medical treatment or surgery. In contrast, other studies have not found type 2 diabetes to be associated with LUTS or BPH.

The current study sought to examine the association between type 2 diabetes and LUTS using two large cohorts in which all participants completed a questionnaire that included a standardized assessment of LUTS, the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI).

### Global guideline for type 2 diabetes: recommendations for standard, comprehensive, and minimal care [^111CTNGJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Clinical Guidelines Task Force of the International Diabetes Federation has created an evidence-based Global Guideline for the care of people with Type 2 diabetes around the world. The recommendations developed for three levels of care (standard, comprehensive, and minimal), which can be applied in settings with different resources, are presented here. The source document is published elsewhere.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

### Precision subclassification of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^116JAcvf]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes presentation and progression suggests that precision medicine interventions could improve clinical outcomes. We undertook a systematic review to determine whether strategies to subclassify type 2 diabetes were associated with high quality evidence, reproducible results and improved outcomes for patients.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for publications that used 'simple subclassification' approaches using simple categorisation of clinical characteristics, or 'complex subclassification' approaches which used machine learning or 'omics approaches in people with established type 2 diabetes. We excluded other diabetes subtypes and those predicting incident type 2 diabetes. We assessed quality, reproducibility and clinical relevance of extracted full-text articles and qualitatively synthesised a summary of subclassification approaches.

Results

Here we show data from 51 studies that demonstrate many simple stratification approaches, but none have been replicated and many are not associated with meaningful clinical outcomes. Complex stratification was reviewed in 62 studies and produced reproducible subtypes of type 2 diabetes that are associated with outcomes. Both approaches require a higher grade of evidence but support the premise that type 2 diabetes can be subclassified into clinically meaningful subtypes.

Conclusion

Critical next steps toward clinical implementation are to test whether subtypes exist in more diverse ancestries and whether tailoring interventions to subtypes will improve outcomes.

### Type 2 diabetes [^112mEZJj]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

415 million people live with diabetes worldwide, and an estimated 193 million people have undiagnosed diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of patients with diabetes and leads to microvascular and macrovascular complications that cause profound psychological and physical distress to both patients and carers and put a huge burden on health-care systems. Despite increasing knowledge regarding risk factors for type 2 diabetes and evidence for successful prevention programmes, the incidence and prevalence of the disease continues to rise globally. Early detection through screening programmes and the availability of safe and effective therapies reduces morbidity and mortality by preventing or delaying complications. Increased understanding of specific diabetes phenotypes and genotypes might result in more specific and tailored management of patients with type 2 diabetes, as has been shown in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young. In this Seminar, we describe recent developments in the diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes, existing controversies, and future directions of care.

### Idiopathic type 1 diabetes [^116r2Lqi]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the available pathophysiological and clinical studies of patients with idiopathic Type 1 diabetes. Idiopathic Type 1 diabetes is a common form of diabetes most commonly seen in obese African American individuals living in large urban areas. This type of diabetes usually presents with the typical signs and symptoms of Type 1 diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis but its subsequent clinical course often resembles Type 2 diabetes. The natural history and pathogenesis of idiopathic Type 1 diabetes is unknown because most of these studies on these patients were done shortly after diagnosis. For the most part, these patients have been treated as if they had Type 2 diabetes with diet and/or oral agents but recent studies suggest that patients have a very variable response to diet and oral agents. They seem to have better long-term glycemic control with the use of insulin therapy. Although the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown, it may be related to lipotoxicity, glucose toxicity or transcription factors involved in fuel metabolism.

Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — adult screening and testing recommendations state that testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors; for all people, screening should begin at age 35 years. In people without prediabetes or diabetes after screening, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk. To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, PG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate, and when using OGTT as a screening tool, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing.

Type 2 diabetes accounts for nearly 90% of the approximately 537 million cases of diabetes worldwide. The number affected is increasing rapidly with alarming trends in children and young adults (up to age 40 years). Early detection and proactive management are crucial for prevention and mitigation of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality burden. Access to novel therapies improves person-centred outcomes beyond glycaemic control. Precision medicine, including multiomics and pharmacogenomics, hold promise to enhance understanding of disease heterogeneity, leading to targeted therapies. Technology might improve outcomes, but its potential is yet to be realised. Despite advances, substantial barriers to changing the course of the epidemic remain. This Seminar offers a clinically focused review of the recent developments in type 2 diabetes care including controversies and future directions.

### Why prescribe exercise as therapy in type 2 diabetes? We have a pill for that! [^117YUeE6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of T2D cases are preventable through a healthy lifestyle, leaving little room for questions that lifestyle should be the first line of defence in the fight against the development of T2D. However, when it comes to the clinical care of T2D, the potential efficacy of lifestyle is much less clear-cut, both in terms of impacting the pathological metabolic biomarkers of the disease, and long-term complications. A healthy diet, high leisure-time physical activity, and exercise are considered to be cornerstones albeit adjunct to drug therapy in the management of T2D. The prescription and effective implementation of structured exercise and other lifestyle interventions in the treatment of T2D have not been routinely used. In this article, we critically appraise and debate our reflections as to why exercise and physical activity may not have reached the status of a viable and effective treatment in the clinical care of T2D to the same extent as pharmaceutical drugs. We argue that the reason why exercise therapy is not utilized to a satisfactory degree is multifaceted and primarily relates to a "vicious cycle" with lack of proven efficacy on T2D complications and a lack of proven effectiveness on risk factors in the primary care of T2D. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental research establishing the optimal dose of exercise. This precludes widespread and sustained implementation of physical activity and exercise in the clinical treatment of T2D will not succeed.

Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in ≥ 5%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for NOVOLOG-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with NOVOLOG and at the same rate or greater on NOVOLOG than on comparator

Severe Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NOVOLOG. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for NOVOLOG with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.

Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in:

### Postmenopausal symptoms in female veterans with type 2 diabetes: glucose control and symptom severity [^111pEzqW]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Background

While type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common condition of midlife women, few studies have examined its influence on the symptom features of menopause. To explore this relationship, we conducted a study of symptom patterns of diabetic patients using a random sample of female veterans receiving care in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare system.

Methods

A cross-sectional comparison was conducted with three groups of postmenopausal respondents (ages 45–60 years) to a mailed national survey who also consented to clinical data access: no diabetes (n = 90), diabetes with better glucose control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≤ 7%, n = 135) and diabetes with worse glucose control (HbA1c > 7%, n = 102).

Results

Respondents, on average, were obese (body mass index: 33.9 ± 0.4 kg/m²), 11.30 ± 0.2 years postmenopause, with more than one chronic illness. Despite higher body mass index and increased comorbidities in women with diabetes compared with nondiabetic women, measures of mental health (anxiety, depressed mood, stress) were similar across groups. The pattern of menopause symptoms did not differ by group. Muscle aches/joint pain was the most prevalent symptom (78.6%), followed by vasomotor symptoms (74.4%). Respondents with elevated HbA1c demonstrated higher total menopausal symptom severity scores (DM-HbA1c > 7: 15.4 ± 0.8 vs. DM-HbA1c ≤ 7%: 12.2 ± 0.8 vs. No diabetes: 12.3 ± 0.8; p = 0.006) than the other two groups.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal female veterans with diabetes, glucose control is associated with the severity of those symptoms commonly attributed to menopause. Joint pain is an important part of the postmenopausal symptom complex in this population.

Monitoring of clinical symptoms and signs

Several clinical symptoms and signs listed in Table 2, are similar for patients with HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF and need to be assessed at every visit. Both symptoms and signs can be used for monitoring treatment response and its stability over time. However, there are difficulties in accurately diagnosing HF solely based on symptoms and signs since both are often non-specific, especially in the early stages of the disease, or they are masked by other conditions, especially in elderly individuals with other comorbid conditions. Moreover, some signs indicate specifically HF, but they are hard to detect in clinical practice and are poorly reproducible. In general, diagnosing HFpEF is more challenging than HFrEF. This is caused by the absence of a dilated LV in HFpEF patients who have an increased LV wall thickness instead and/or an increased left atrial size as a sign of an enhanced filling pressure.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: introduction to diabetic neuropathy [^112XaySw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

So those are the initial symptoms that people can complain of, but as the disease progresses then you can get what we call motor [system] involvement and that is actually weakness and you can get weakness that occurs in more distal areas [weakness is closely related to signs and severity of diabetic neuropathy]. It occurs more proximally with the progress of time and as symptoms progress [increasing severity]. And on the flip side of this, there is also autonomic symptoms as well and these tend to only present quite late on the disease course. When I mean autonomic symptoms, I mean those that may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or genitourinary systems and include sweat glands. [Cardiac] Autonomic symptoms tend not to occur in the early stages of autonomic neuropathy [which can be detected by cardiac autonomic testing].

VG: What is the most common type of diabetic neuropathy?

UA: So this would be diabetic peripheral neuropathy, also known as distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. So this is what I mentioned before, the glove and stocking distribution of neuropathy of nerve damage, and this tends to be the commonest form, although autonomic neuropathy is extremely common as well.

VG: How is diabetic neuropathy prevented?

UA: I'm going to have to split this into thinking about diabetic neuropathy in terms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. So in type 1 diabetes we have shown that actually having really good glycaemic control can prevent or actually halt the progression of diabetic neuropathy, but the jury is somewhat out with type 2 diabetes and a number of studies have actually shown that glucose control by itself may not affect the prevention or the progression of diabetic neuropathy. So in type 2 diabetes we really think of this as a more multifactorial kind of treatment. In general, we should be telling our patients to control the diabetes and try to improve the cardiovascular risk co-factors including the lipids, triglycerides, hypertension [and weight]. There is some data that suggests that if you are heavier you might have more painful symptoms [and is also a risk factor for diabetic neuropathy], so again those individuals with type 2 diabetes is really an improvement in the weight. Again, diet and exercise, avoid excess alcohol, and of course it's really one of the most paramount things we can ask them to do is to stop smoking as well.

### High prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in developing countries: results from the international diabetes management practices study [^111thQJz]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Depression is common in people with diabetes, but data from developing countries are scarce. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes using data from the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS).

Research Design and Methods

IDMPS is an ongoing multinational, cross-sectional study investigating quality of care in patients with diabetes in real-world settings. Data from wave 5 (2011), including 21 countries, were analyzed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors of depressive symptoms.

Results

Of 9,865 patients eligible for analysis, 2,280 had type 1 and 7,585 had type 2 diabetes (treatment: oral glucose-lowering drugs [OGLD] only, n = 4,729; OGLDs plus insulin, n = 1,892; insulin only, n = 964). Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5) were reported in 30.7% of those with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the respective figures were 29.0% for OGLDs-only, 36.6% for OGLDs-plus-insulin, and 46.7% for insulin-only subgroups. Moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 10–19) were observed in 8–16% of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Female sex, complications, and low socioeconomic status were independently associated with depressive symptoms. In type 1 diabetes and in the type 2 diabetes OGLDs-only group, depression was associated with poor glycemic control.

Conclusions

Depressive symptoms are common in patients with diabetes from developing countries, calling for routine screening, especially in high-risk groups, to reduce the double burden of diabetes and depression and their negative interaction.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: is it feasible? [^113vAJuh]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires the implementation of preventive strategies to halt this trend, tailored to the specific needs of individual regions. Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that subjects with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM, and in some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal. Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, both improving cardiovascular risk profile and reducing the risk of T2DM development. These consistent observations have given rise to large-scale randomized controlled trials that use lifestyle intervention (including behavioural strategies for the reinforcement of prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity or both), with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated.

### MODY: history, genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical decision making [^112m4wKQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

MODY AND THE GENETICS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES

As predicted by J.V. Neel in the premolecular genetic era, type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disease with superimposed precipitating environmental factors. We began our studies of MODY with the expectation that the identification of the genes responsible for MODY would provide insight into the genetics and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Common variants in HNF1A and HNF1B affect risk of type 2 diabetes in large-scale meta-analyses, and common variants in HNF4A may also be associated with type 2 diabetes, at least in some populations. Despite the lack of evidence that mutations in MODY-related genes are responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes in the majority of cases, the molecular mechanisms by which variants in these genes lead to hyperglycemia may be relevant to the pathophysiology of the β-cell defects in type 2 diabetes. In this regard, defects in the metabolism of glucose in the pancreatic β-cell may be responsible, at least in part, for the impaired insulin secretion seen in patients with type 2 diabetes as it is in MODY. Thus, lessons learned from studies of MODY may improve our understanding of type 2 diabetes. Resequencing of the various MODY genes as well as the genes responsible for other monogenic forms of diabetes (dominant and recessive, syndromic and nonsyndromic) is a goal of the National Institutes of Health–funded T2-GENES Consortium, and these studies will help elucidate the role of monogenic diabetes genes in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.

### Common mental disorder and obesity: insight from four repeat measures over 19 years: prospective whitehall II cohort study [^114N4jFy]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

We are not aware of any other study that has four repeat measurements of common mental disorders and direct assessment of weight and height over an extended follow-up period. These analyses therefore make a unique contribution to this area of research. Our findings are in agreement with a recent longitudinal study of elderly people that showed weight gain to be more common among people with symptoms of depression than among those who were symptom-free. Our results are also consistent with those from another cohort that used two sets of measurements to explore the bidirectional association between depression and type 2 diabetes, a condition associated with raised body mass index. In that study, baseline depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes at the second follow-up (two years later), after removal of people with diabetes at baseline and adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors. Given that obesity is the major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, this association would be anticipated from our results, although the association in that study persisted even after adjustment for body mass index, suggesting that it may not be entirely mediated through adiposity. Furthermore, in that cohort, study members with treated type 2 diabetes at baseline were at increased risk of depressive symptoms two years later, again after removal of those with depressive symptoms at baseline and adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, including body mass index. Interestingly, impaired fasting glucose and untreated diabetes at baseline were not associated with risk of depressive symptoms two years later, raising the possibility that the association of treated diabetes with future symptoms may be related to diagnosis of a chronic disease (or the treatment in terms of drugs and dietary restrictions) rather than to obesity or other specific biological mechanisms underlying diabetes. This possibility is consistent with our findings suggesting no real association between obesity and subsequent common mental disorder.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus: not quite exciting enough? [^11682a7J]. Human Molecular Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disease that afflicts around 5% of the population in Western societies and over 150 million people worldwide. It is characterized by elevation of the blood glucose concentration, usually presents in middle age, and is exacerbated by obesity. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease but in the vast majority of cases the aetiology is still not understood. Here we present a novel hypothesis for the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. We postulate that the electrical activity of the insulin-secreting beta-cells of the pancreas acts to integrate the genetic and environmental factors that predispose to disease risk. Our hypothesis is supported by a substantial amount of data gathered from a range of different disciplines and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally both in vitro and in man.

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### Diabetes basics… [^116E63Y2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy. With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. There isn't a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Other things you can do to help:

- Take medicine as prescribed.
- Get diabetes self-management education and support.
- Make and keep health care appointments. Type 2 diabetes With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels.

It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults. You may not notice any symptoms, so it's important to get your blood sugar tested if you're at risk. Keep Reading: About Type 2 Diabetes. Prevention Prediabetes In the United States, about 1 in 3 adults has prediabetes. More than 8 in 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. How you can prevent type 2 diabetes. Diabetes by the numbers In the United States:

- About 38 million adults have diabetes, and 1 in 5 of them don't know they have it.
- Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death.

Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications (including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (such as cardiovascular comorbidities), owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome. Environmental factors (for example, obesity, an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) and genetic factors contribute to the multiple pathophysiological disturbances that are responsible for impaired glucose homeostasis in T2DM. Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion remain the core defects in T2DM, but at least six other pathophysiological abnormalities contribute to the dysregulation of glucose metabolism. The multiple pathogenetic disturbances present in T2DM dictate that multiple antidiabetic agents, used in combination, will be required to maintain normoglycaemia. The treatment must not only be effective and safe but also improve the quality of life. Several novel medications are in development, but the greatest need is for agents that enhance insulin sensitivity, halt the progressive pancreatic β-cell failure that is characteristic of T2DM and prevent or reverse the microvascular complications.

### Type 2 diabetes [^116Y4Fvc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent illness that causes major vascular, renal, and neurologic complications. Prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications are of paramount importance. Many new treatments have emerged over the past 5–10 years. Recent evidence shows that newer treatments may substantially reduce risk for cardiac and renal disease, suggesting that it may be necessary to change existing treatment paradigms. This review summarizes the evidence supporting diabetes prevention and treatment, focusing on aspects that are commonly in the purview of primary care physicians.

### Depressive symptoms are associated with physical inactivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. the DIAZOB primary care diabetes study [^116sPvYo]. Family Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, associated with poor disease outcomes such as impaired glycaemic control, cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. The mechanisms behind these associations are unclear. Depression might contribute to poor disease outcomes through decreased physical activity.

Objective

To test whether type 2 diabetes patients with elevated depression scores are more often physically inactive.

Methods

Demographic features, clinical factors, level of physical inactivity and depressive symptoms were assessed in 2646 primary care patients with type 2 diabetes. Sequential multiple logistic regression analyses [odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI)] were performed to test the association between depressive symptoms and physical inactivity.

Results

About 48% of the respondents were physically inactive. Elevated depressive symptoms were found in 14% of the respondents. After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds for being physically inactive were almost doubled in depressed patients with type 2 diabetes 1.74 (95% CI 1.32–2.31).

Conclusions

Presence of depressive symptoms almost doubles the likelihood of physical inactivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether physical inactivity forms the link between depression and poor disease outcomes.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in older people [^111E6yVH]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Prevalence of diabetes is increasing and aging of population is the main driving factor. Older people with diabetes tend to have multiple comorbidities and develop geriatric syndromes in addition to the traditional cardiovascular complications. Therefore, initial assessment on diagnosis should be comprehensive and include screening for these syndromes, especially cognitive and physical dysfunction. Due to the heterogeneous nature of older people with diabetes, management plans should be individualized with variable glycemic targets from tight control in fit individuals to lax approach in frail ones. Quality of life should be at the center of management plans.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1158UKaE]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes risk factors and consideration of alternate etiology — The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity; it occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome, is more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial, ethnic, and ancestral subgroups, and is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives. In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g. GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

### Risk models and scores for type 2 diabetes: systematic review [^111T8WeD]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Millions of participants across the world have already participated in epidemiological studies aimed at developing a diabetes risk score. An extensive menu of possible scores are now available to those who seek to use them clinically or to validate them in new populations, none of which is perfect but all of which have strengths. Nevertheless, despite the growing public health importance of type 2 diabetes and the enticing possibility of prevention for those at high risk of developing it, questions remain about how best to undertake risk prediction and what to do with the results. Appropriately, the balance of research effort is now shifting from devising new risk scores to exploring how best to use those we already have.

### Symptom burden of adults with type 2 diabetes across the disease course: diabetes&aging study [^116PRxWQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing symptom burden is paramount at the end-of-life, but typically considered secondary to risk factor control in chronic disease, such as diabetes. Little is known about the symptom burden experienced by adults with type 2 diabetes and the need for symptom palliation.

Objective

To examine pain and non-pain symptoms of adults with type 2 diabetes over the disease course - at varying time points before death and by age.

Design

Survey follow-up study.

Participants

13,171 adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 30–75 years, from Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, who answered a baseline symptom survey in 2005–2006.

Main Measures

Pain and non-pain symptoms were identified by self-report and medical record data. Survival status from baseline was categorized into ≤ 6, > 6–24, or alive > 24 months.

Key Results

Mean age was 60 years; 48% were women, and 43% were non-white. Acute pain was prevalent (41.8%) and 39.7% reported chronic pain, 24.6% fatigue, 23.7% neuropathy, 23.5% depression, 24.2% insomnia, and 15.6% physical/emotional disability. Symptom burden was prevalent in all survival status categories, but was more prevalent among those with shorter survival, p < .001. Adults ≥ 60 years who were alive > 24 months reported more physical symptoms such as acute pain and dyspnea, whereas participants < 60 years reported more psychosocial symptoms, such as depressed mood and insomnia. Adjustment for duration of diabetes and comorbidity reduced the association between age and pain, but did not otherwise change our results.

Conclusions

In a diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, pain and non-pain symptoms were common among all patients, not only among those near the end of life. However, symptoms were more prevalent among patients with shorter survival. Older adults reported more physical symptoms, whereas younger adults reported more psychosocial symptoms. Diabetes care management should include not only good cardiometabolic control, but also symptom palliation across the disease course.

### Lifestyle precision medicine: the next generation in type 2 diabetes prevention? [^116j5pvq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The driving force behind the current global type 2 diabetes epidemic is insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals. Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain 'prediabetic' or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale. The emergence of biomarker technologies has allowed more targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes prevention (precision medicine), though largely confined to pharmacotherapy. Unlike most drugs, lifestyle interventions often have systemic health-enhancing effects. Thus, the pursuance of lifestyle precision medicine in diabetes seems rational. Herein, we review the literature on lifestyle interventions and diabetes prevention, describing the biological systems that can be characterized at scale in human populations, linking them to lifestyle in diabetes, and consider some of the challenges impeding the clinical translation of lifestyle precision medicine.

Results

Search and screening for simple and complex systematic review questions

The first question examined simple stratification approaches using clinical variables that may reveal type 2 diabetes heterogeneity. A total of 6097 studies met the inclusion criteria and were screened (Fig. 1A). Of these, 183 studies were included for full text data review, of which 132 studies were subsequently excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion at the full-text review stage were studies conducted in populations without prevalent or incident type 2 diabetes, study designs that used ML approaches or stratification approaches that used HbA1c or diabetes medications. In total, 51 "simple approach" studies underwent full-text data extraction.

A This shows the flow diagram for simple approaches to subclassification and B Complex approaches.

The second question aimed to identify papers with complex approaches, mostly ML-based strategies, to identify subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1B). A total of 6639 studies were screened, of which 106 were found eligible for full-text review. The most common reasons for exclusion were study populations not comprising participants with type 2 diabetes or classification approaches not using ML. In total, 62 'complex' studies underwent full-text data extraction.

### Precision subclassification of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^111wyUZT]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Literature search and selection strategy

PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to May 2022 for relevant articles using a strategy devised by expert health sciences librarians (supplementary methods). We undertook independent searches for each systematic review question. From both searches, each abstract and subsequently, full text paper, was screened by two independent team members for eligibility. In addition to the initial exclusion criteria, at the full-text review stage, we further excluded studies where exposures were not clearly defined and/or if the data on outcomes of the stratification were not available in results or supplementary material. We also excluded studies where the only stratification modality was a measure of glycaemic control, as this itself provides the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. In cases of disagreement between two reviewers, a third reviewer made the final decision. The process involved group-based discussions to resolve disagreements to ensure all decisions were made on the same grounds.

Data extraction

Data were manually extracted from each full-text paper by individual team members and cross-checked by an independent team member at the data synthesis stage. We extracted relevant data on study design (observational or clinical trial), analysis design (cross-sectional or prospective), study population characteristics, stratification method and results (exposure), outcomes, and study quality assessment. For population characteristics, we extracted data on whether the type 2 diabetes population was new-onset or prevalent, the sample size, ethnicity and gender, the duration of diabetes (for cross-sectional analysis) and duration of follow-up (for longitudinal follow-up). For exposures, we extracted the approach to stratification and the number and nature of subgroups identified. For outcomes, we documented the type of outcome studied and the findings according to stratified subgroup.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113cR4vq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and classification — Type 2 diabetes phenotype — Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes and encompasses individuals who generally have relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes and, when seen, usually arises with insulinopenia, missed or inadequate insulin doses, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, intercurrent illness such as dehydration or infection, or in association with medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or SGLT2 inhibitors. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is more typically associated with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis, and mixed DKA/HHS presentations can occur.

### Precision subclassification of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^1131WC3h]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a global health problem posing substantial burdens on human health. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is based on elevated blood glucose coupled with the absence of clinical features indicating alternative subtypes, such as type 1, monogenic, pancreatic or medication-induced diabetes. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is generally the default or can be arrived at through exclusion of other types. Traditionally, most type 2 diabetes care guidelines have advocated treatment choice based on cost-effectiveness and side effects of specific medications, which have no relationship to underlying pathophysiology in the individual. More recent guidelines have suggested differential glucose-lowering therapies on the basis of higher body mass index (BMI) (favouring use of glucagon-like peptide analogue, GLP-1) or presence or absence of cardiovascular and/or renal disease and/or heart failure (favouring GLP-1 and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, SGLT-2 inhibitors).

There is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinicians recognise that differences in degree of obesity or body fat distribution, age, dyslipidaemia or presence of metabolic syndrome can influence prognosis in diabetes and can be important considerations in treatment and management –. There is increasing awareness that type 2 diabetes heterogeneity may reflect differences in the underlying pathophysiology, environmental contributors, and the genetic risk of affected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the development of type 2 diabetes may differ from one individual to another and this could impact treatment and outcome.

Accurate characterisation of the heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes may help individualise care and improve outcomes. This goal has been realised in part for monogenic diabetes, where treatments can be tailored to genetic subtype to deliver precision care achieving better outcomes than standard care. Given the complex pathophysiology and genetics of type 2 diabetes, applying precision medicine approaches is challenging. Critical to this endeavour is a better understanding of specific subtypes.

Potential preventable burden and risk factors: Diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the third most common chronic disease in childhood, and compared with non-Hispanic White youth, the type 2 diabetes rate in American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic/Latino youth has been shown to be 5, 4, and 8 times higher, respectively; obesity and excess adipose tissue, especially when centrally distributed, are the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes in younger persons, and family history of diabetes (including gestational diabetes) is also a strong risk factor.

### Screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^117Uh7tX]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents states that for children and adolescents younger than 18 years who do not have any symptoms of type 2 diabetes, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents (Grade: I statement). It applies to children and adolescents younger than 18 years who have no signs or symptoms of diabetes or prediabetes, and screening for diabetes in adolescents who are pregnant is covered in a separate USPSTF recommendation. This is a new USPSTF recommendation; the USPSTF has not previously released a recommendation on this topic. Implementation notes specify there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents without symptoms of diabetes or prediabetes, and clinicians should use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.

### The relationship of depressive symptoms to symptom reporting, self-care and glucose control in diabetes [^113SpH2Y]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Depressive symptoms are common among patients with diabetes and may have a significant impact on self-management and health outcomes. In this study we predicted that: 1) there would be a significant association between depressive symptoms and diabetes symptom burden, physical functioning, diabetes self-care, and HbA1c levels; and, 2) that the association between depressive symptoms and HbA1c levels would be significantly greater in type 1, as compared to type 2 diabetic patients. This cross-sectional observational study of 276 type 1 and 199 type 2 diabetes patients took place in a tertiary care specialty clinic. We collected self-reported data on depressive symptoms, complications, medical comorbidity, diabetes symptoms, diabetes self-care behaviors, physical functioning, and demographics. From automated data we determined mean HbA1c levels over the prior year. We performed linear regression analyses to assess the association between depressive symptoms and diabetes symptom perception, diabetes self-care behaviors, physical functioning, and glycemic control. Among patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, depressive symptoms were associated with greater diabetes symptom reporting, poorer physical functioning, and less adherence to exercise regimens and diet. There was a significant association between depressive symptoms and HbA1c levels in type 1, but not type 2 diabetic patients. Because of their association with clinical aspects of diabetes care such as diabetes symptom reporting and adherence to diabetes self-care, depressive symptoms are important to recognize in treating patients with diabetes.

### Web-based depression treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized, controlled trial [^116njEsE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Comorbid depression is common in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, adversely affecting quality of life, diabetes outcomes, and mortality. Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance.

Research Design and Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up.

Results

The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P < 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P < 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P < 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.

Glycemic thresholds for intensification and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes: When A1C is ≥ 1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal, many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent agent; insulin should be considered as part of any combination plan when hyperglycemia is severe, and it is common practice to initiate insulin for blood glucose levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (≥ 16.7 mmol/L) or A1C ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), or if symptomatic hyperglycemia or catabolic signs are present; people with severe hyperglycemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for baseline A1C above 10–12%.

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

Oral agents and noninsulin injectables.

Important properties of antihyperglycemic agents that play a role in the choice of drug(s) in individual patients are summarized in Table 1. Ultimately, the aims of controlling glycemia are to avoid acute osmotic symptoms of hyperglycemia, to avoid instability in blood glucose over time, and to prevent/delay the development of diabetes complications without adversely affecting quality of life. Information on whether specific agents have this ability is incomplete; an answer to these questions requires long-term, large-scale clinical trials — not available for most drugs. Effects on surrogate measures for glycemic control (e.g. HbA 1c) generally reflect changes in the probability of developing microvascular disease but not necessarily macrovascular complications. Particularly from a patient standpoint, stability of metabolic control over time may be another specific goal.

Table 1
Properties of currently available glucose-lowering agents that may guide treatment choice in individual patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

Metformin, a biguanide, remains the most widely used first-line type 2 diabetes drug; its mechanism of action predominately involves reducing hepatic glucose production. It is generally considered weight-neutral with chronic use and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is associated with initial gastrointestinal side effects, and caution is advised to avoid its use in patients at risk for lactic acidosis (e.g. in advanced renal insufficiency, alcoholism), a rare complication of therapy. As noted earlier, there may be some cardiovascular benefits from this drug, but the clinical trial data are not robust.

The oldest oral agent class is the sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues. Through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on β-cells, these drugs stimulate insulin release. While effective in controlling glucose levels, their use is associated with modest weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, studies have demonstrated a secondary failure rate that may exceed other drugs, ascribed to an exacerbation of islet dysfunction. Shorter-acting secretagogues, the meglitinides (or glinides), stimulate insulin release through similar mechanisms but may be associated with less hypoglycemia. They require more frequent dosing, however.

### Association of depressive symptoms with impaired glucose regulation, screen-detected, and previously known type 2 diabetes: findings from the Finnish D2D survey [^116C537r]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Recent population-based studies have indicated that there was no clear association between diabetes and depressive symptoms. In line with those studies, the present study indicated that comorbidities were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. The data of the present study showed that people with diabetes very often have other somatic diseases. Having a somatic comorbidity seemed to be strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Therefore, the findings of the present study support the view that an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms among people with diabetes is related by their excessive disease burden. However, the current study cannot rule out the possibility that common underlying physiological factors play a role.

Depressive symptoms were defined on the basis of self-reported data. A diagnostic interview was not undertaken, which can be regarded as a limitation of our study. However, a BDI with a cutoff score of 10 points has been shown to be a feasible instrument for depression screening, and a cutoff score of 16 points has been shown to be feasible for detecting depression among outpatients with diabetes. The present study was based on cross-sectional data, and, therefore, we are not able to draw any conclusions about causality. Further, we are not able to exclude the possibility that duration of disease is related to the present findings. The strength of this study is the large representative population sample of middle-aged men and women. Contrary to previous population-based studies, we used the standard diagnostic procedure with OGTT in defining diabetes and glucose regulation abnormalities.

We conclude that compared with people with NGR or IGR, people with diagnosed type 2 diabetes more commonly had depressive symptoms. People with previously unknown diabetes did not differ from people with NGR or IGR. The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that an increased level of depressive symptoms among people with type 2 diabetes is related to their excessive disease burden, physical activity, and marital status.

### Precision subclassification of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^115USUL2]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this first systematic review of the evidence underpinning type 2 diabetes diagnostic subclassification, multiple approaches were identified. Among them are strategies that used simple criteria based on fundamental categorisation of mostly routine measures, and complex approaches with multi-trait or genetic inputs that required ML or other computation. While simple approaches are more easily deployed, the study designs and level of evidence currently limits any firm conclusions regarding the utility of such approaches. The clinical variables and data incorporated into 'complex' approaches have yielded reproducible subclassifications and a growing body of evidence supports clinically meaningful associations of subtypes with outcomes and treatment responses. This is a rapidly evolving field with higher quality evidence emerging. It will be crucial to develop interventions that target diverse populations and be feasible in all resource settings to prevent widening existing inequalities in the precision medicine era of diabetes care.

### Unrecognised cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: is it time to act earlier? [^116Ay3yd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been shown to have a significantly high prevalence, incidence and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, patients with T2D may have seemingly asymptomatic CV damage, with ischaemic episodes remaining undetected at a reported prevalence of one in three patients with diabetes (compared with one in five patients without diabetes). Therefore, CV sequelae may develop much earlier than detected, with the disease only recognised once symptoms are more pronounced. At a regional expert meeting convened to consider the challenges presented by unrecognised CVD in T2D, we identified a lack of clarity with regard to definitions, diagnostic criteria, prevalence and care. The atypical symptoms of CVD experienced by patients with T2D have variously been described as 'silent' or 'asymptomatic'. Without a clear terminology, and with a paucity of recent studies, an assessment of prevalence is challenging, while guidelines have to rely on data obtained without uniform definitions and before the development of current standards of care. In light of this, we would like to propose a definition for unrecognised CVD in patients with T2D, as an initial step towards providing clarity on the disease, the atypical symptoms that healthcare professionals should be aware of, and how best to assess patients for unrecognised CVD. We also seek to offer a vision for how an improved definition could ultimately lead to a simple and readily implementable screening strategy.

### Clinical presentation and treatment of type 2 diabetes in children [^116tvpXm]. Pediatric Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has dramatically increased throughout the world in many ethnic groups and among people with diverse social and economic backgrounds. This increase has also affected the young such that over the past decade, the increase in the number of children and youth with T2DM has been labeled an 'epidemic'. Before the 1990s, it was rare for most pediatric centers to have significant numbers of patients with T2DM. However, by 1994, T2DM patients represented up to 16% of new cases of diabetes in children in urban areas and by 1999, depending on geographic location, the range of percentage of new cases because of T2DM was 8–45% and disproportionately represented among minority populations. Although the diagnosis was initially regarded with skepticism, T2DM is now a serious diagnostic consideration in all young people who present with signs and symptoms of diabetes in the USA.

### Treat obesity to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113xgybb]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Obesity is a multifactorial chronic, relapsing progressive disease. It is a root cause of T2DM and harbors increased risk for diabetes-related complications. An obesity-centric treatment approach with sustained weigh loss helps target a key driver of T2DM much earlier in the disease course. Obesity management may also serve as a useful intervention in already established diabetes and its complications. Finally, obesity should be prevented or treated to prevent or treat type 2 diabetes and its complications.

SGLT inhibition and risk of ketosis — individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT inhibitor therapy; SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes, the risk can be 5–17 times higher than in untreated type 1 diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, DKA is uncommon with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years; up to a third of SGLT2-associated DKA cases present with glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and in one small study 71% presented with glucose ≤ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); risk factors include low-carbohydrate diets, decreased caloric intake, alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors, and it is important to educate individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to provide accurate tools for ketone measurement.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^115TcJLY]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

### Precision subclassification of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^116xL5gG]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was written and conducted in accordance with our pre-established protocol (PROSPERO ID CRD42022310539) and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA). We systematically reviewed papers to address two research questions devised by an expert working group: 1) What are the main subtypes of type 2 diabetes defined using simple clinical criteria and/or routinely available laboratory tests (simple approaches), and 2) What subphenotypes of type 2 diabetes can be reproducibly identified using ML and/or genomics approaches (complex approaches)? Subsequently, we refer to the first question as simple approaches and the second question as complex approaches. The quality of each paper was reported, and the aggregate of data evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system.

Study eligibility criteria

We included English-language original research studies of all design types that analysed populations with prevalent or new-onset type 2 diabetes and attempted in some way to stratify or subgroup patients with type 2 diabetes. We used broad terms to identify stratification studies and all approaches to stratification (the exposure) were included (supplementary table 1). We excluded studies examining risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, use of glycaemic control (e.g. HbA1c strata) alone to stratify, studies of stratification in types of diabetes other than type 2 diabetes, and review articles or case reports.

For simple approaches the exposure was defined as any of the following; a routine blood or urine biomarker that was widely available in most clinic settings; a blood or urine biomarker that might not be routinely available now but could have the potential to become easily accessible; any routinely available imaging modality; any physiological assessment that could be undertaken in an outpatient setting or results from routinely available dynamic tests. The stratification approach was either a cut-off or categorisation based on one or more of the above or if an index, ratio, trend or other analysis was undertaken, it could be calculated without complex mathematics. Finally, all outcomes were accepted for example clinical characterisation of subgroups, association with specific biomarkers and association with complications or mortality.

For complex approaches, the exposure used was defined as any of the inputs for the simple approach outlined above and/or any form of genetic data. However, unlike the simple approach, the stratification approach either deployed ML approaches or used other complex statistical approaches for stratification. All outcomes were accepted, as above, for simple.

### Living with type 2 diabetes: podcast of a patient-physician discussion [^1175d6Lr]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

PK: That's a rocky road you had. So you had those four stents placed, and that's consistent with triple-vessel heart disease, which is very common in people with diabetes. So two questions for you: how old was your father when he had heart disease?

AD: Oh my gosh. I think it was probably his later 40s as well.

PK: Okay, that's very young. And did you have any symptoms during the time that you had that heart attack?

AD: Not really any that I connected to a heart attack. I was tired, but I was busy, and then, in the middle of the night, I couldn't sleep, and then my breathing was a little bit harder, but I couldn't understand why. And the next day, I did have some typical symptoms, which was the pain in the arm, the tightness in the chest, and that's when I realized, 'I know these symptoms', and that's when I called 911.

PK: This is very typical, Anne. You're basically well until you're not, and a lot of people think they're fine until it's almost too late. Sometimes clinicians are very busy, and in that way asymptomatic conditions could be diagnosed later, and if the patient doesn't bring it to the physician's attention, the early stages of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease might be missed. We need to remember that kidney disease is commonly seen in patients who have diabetes, so we want to make sure to screen patients regularly for this.

Also, we want to remind clinicians to be aware of the cardiorenal metabolic risks that are an important part of type 2 diabetes. What this means in English is that the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, and brain all work together, which is why clinicians call it the name 'cardiorenal metabolic disease'. How did you feel emotionally about this whole process?

### Insulin aspart [^1174jWFR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in ≥ 5%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events that occurred at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Table 1: Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator

Table 2: Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart than on comparator

Severe Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.

Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in:

### Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: time for an evidence-based about-face? [^116HHG4U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%) to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs and offers uncertain benefits in return. We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being and healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

### What does postprandial hyperglycaemia mean? [^116Czxj6]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

The potential importance of postprandial glucose (PPG) control in the development of complications in Type 2 diabetes is much debated. The recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus statement discussed the role of postprandial hyperglycaemia in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and concluded that the relationship between PPG excursions and the well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be further examined. Using the ADA statement as a starting point and including the more recent American College of Endocrinology guidelines on glycaemic control, a panel of experts in diabetes met to review the role of PPG within the context of the overall metabolic syndrome, in the development of complications in Type 2 diabetes.

Results

Post-prandial hyperglycaemia is a risk indicator for micro- and macrovascular complications, not only in patients with Type 2 diabetes but also in those with impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, the metabolic syndrome confers an increased risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. The debate focused on the relative contributions of postprandial hyperglycaemia, the metabolic syndrome and, in particular, raised triglyceride levels in the postprandial state, to the development of cardiovascular complications of diabetes.

Conclusions

The panel recommended that in the prevention and management of microvascular complications of Type 2 diabetes, targeting both chronic and acute glucose fluctuations is necessary. Lowering the macrovascular risk also requires control of (postprandial) triglyceride levels and other components of the metabolic syndrome.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111toY7V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis — increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention — with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes — and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^114p1JTF]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management — background on diabetes mellitus outlines disease mechanisms, prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and treatment distinctions with implications for activity in wilderness settings. Diabetes mellitus is described as a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose from a lack of insulin secretion, reduced insulin sensitivity, or both, with type 2 diabetes the most common form (90% of individuals with diabetes have type 2 diabetes). Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children or young adults and results from autoimmune destruction of islet cells causing insulin deficiency; people with type 1 diabetes require treatment with subcutaneous insulin, whereas those with type 2 diabetes may or may not require insulin treatment. The text notes that strenuous exercise and wilderness environments can complicate glycemic control, and that exercise and environmental stressors may interact with commonly used medications, glucose monitoring, and medication delivery.

### Hyperglycemic crises in diabetes mellitus type 2 [^115AjpY9]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic crises in type 2 diabetes are not rare and are becoming increasingly recognized as part of the spectrum of the presentation of previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and the decompensation of established diabetes mellitus. Contributing factors and associations are being elucidated but remain far from clear, particularly in DKA states. Medications commonly used in the treatment of many comorbid illnesses in patients with diabetes can themselves predispose to HHS. Endocrinopathies can contribute to insulin resistance and directly increase the glycemic load, leading to hyperglycemia. Medications such as the protease inhibitors may in the future lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the metabolic derangements seen in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Interplay between chronic widespread pain and lifestyle factors on the risk of type 2 diabetes: longitudinal data from the Norwegian HUNT study [^112U7AuH]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disorder and represents a significant global disease burden. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Excessive weight, physical inactivity, poor sleep, and energy-dense diet represent strong risk factors for type 2 diabetes; thus, preventive interventions commonly rely on intensive lifestyle modification.

Chronic widespread pain affects around 10% of the general adult population globallyand is the most common cause of long-term disability. Chronic widespread pain has been suggested to signal increased risk of type 2 diabetes, although longitudinal evidence about this association is limited and conflicting. Adverse lifestyle factors associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (eg, obesity, poor sleep, physical inactivity) often cluster in people with chronic widespread pain. It has been shown that chronic pain combined with obesity may lead to worse functional status and quality of life and increased pain sensitivity compared with when these conditions occur in isolation. The relation between chronic pain and obesity is thought to involve a complex interplay of systemic inflammation, biomechanical load, and autonomic dysregulation. Obesity and chronic pain may also interact through psychological disturbances such as decrease in self-esteem and increase in depressive symptoms, which in turn impact on physical activity levels and sleep quality.

Although chronic pain and diabetes commonly co-occur, it is not clear whether chronic widespread pain infers an additional risk for type 2 diabetes among those with known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the potential synergistic effect between chronic widespread pain and adiposity, leisure time physical activity, and insomnia symptoms on the risk of diabetes.

### Key biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review [^111DKzty]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The term 'diabetes mellitus' was introduced in 1674 by Thomas Willis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is the epidemic of the 21st century. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 537 million adults aged 20–79 years are living with diabetes worldwide (Figure 1). There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: type 1, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes. T2DM accounts for 90%–95% of all diabetes cases.T1DM is recognized as an autoimmune disease. It occurs due to the destruction of β cells, which are responsible for producing insulin in the pancreatic islets by T cells, resulting in a high blood glucose concentration. T2DM is a chronic disease characterized by two pathophysiological mechanisms: (1) decrease (20%–65%) in the mass and quantity of pancreatic β cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion; (2) when insulin becomes less effective, cells in muscles, fat and liver fail to respond adequately to insulin. As a result, more insulin is required to control blood glucose concentration by inhibiting glucose production in the liver and inducing glucose adsorption in muscle and adipose cells. Over time, elevated levels of circulating insulin cause insulin resistance in the body, and the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to overcome the cells' resistance. T2DM is a complex disease influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.
