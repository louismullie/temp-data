## Question

STEMI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about STEMI management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and initial risk stratification. Then, I should verify the reperfusion strategy based on time and access to PCI. Next, I will review adjunctive pharmacotherapy and special populations. After that, I need to check system-level quality metrics and transfer protocols. Finally, I will consider secondary prevention, evidence gaps, and how to synthesize this into a practical algorithm, making sure I continuously validate claims against guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk stratification, because missing STEMI or underestimating risk has immediate consequences. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of first medical contact and interpret it promptly, repeating ECGs if the initial tracing is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, since about 11% of STEMI patients initially have nondiagnostic ECGs and many convert within 90 minutes, and I must also consider posterior STEMI patterns such as ST depression in V1–V3 and reciprocal changes that can be subtle but critical [^511e8334] [^6261e614]. I need to check for high-risk features including cardiogenic shock, persistent ischemia, large anterior infarcts, and conduction disturbances, and I should use high-sensitivity troponin with serial sampling to refine diagnosis and risk, recognizing that troponin kinetics help distinguish STEMI from NSTEMI but do not replace ECG-based reperfusion decisions in STEMI [^2b7b57e9] [^2878aa48].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reperfusion until I anchor the time window and logistics. Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy when it can be delivered within guideline time frames, specifically first medical contact to device activation within 90 minutes at PCI-capable hospitals and within 120 minutes when transfer is required, and this applies to patients presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset, with consideration of PCI beyond 12 hours if there is ongoing ischemia or high-risk features [^b090073b] [^7cf97a7e]. I should double-check that these thresholds are consistent with contemporary guidelines and that they reflect mortality benefits tied to time-to-reperfusion, which they do across ACC/AHA/ACEP and ESC documents [^b090073b] [^84e5d767].

> Wait, let me verify the role of fibrinolysis when PCI cannot meet time targets. If the anticipated delay to PCI exceeds 120 minutes from first medical contact and there are no contraindications, fibrinolysis should be administered as soon as possible, ideally within 30 minutes of hospital arrival, with a pharmaco-invasive approach that includes routine coronary angiography within 24 hours and PCI if indicated, because this strategy reduces adverse outcomes compared with lysis alone or facilitated PCI in many analyses [^7629ad2e] [^2325f6cd]. I should confirm agent selection and dosing nuances, including preference for tenecteplase in prehospital settings and dose adjustments in older adults, and I need to ensure antithrombotic adjuncts are aligned with guideline-directed therapy during and after lysis [^notfound].

> I will now examine adjunctive pharmacotherapy that applies regardless of reperfusion strategy, because delays in these therapies worsen outcomes. Aspirin should be given immediately at 150–325 mg chewed or swallowed, followed by a P2Y12 inhibitor, with prasugrel or ticagrelor preferred in PCI and clopidogrel reasonable with fibrinolysis, and dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued for 12 months unless bleeding risk is high, in which case I should consider shorter courses or alternative strategies per guideline exceptions [^f6f9cdd7] [^02cb6b12]. For anticoagulation, I should use unfractionated heparin with PCI and consider bivalirudin as an alternative in selected patients, while with fibrinolysis I can use enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, and I should stop parenteral anticoagulation immediately after the invasive procedure to mitigate bleeding risk [^ed9d3a58] [^d421f626]. Let me reconsider beta-blockers: IV beta-blockers are not routine in the acute phase due to risk of cardiogenic shock; instead, I should start oral beta-blockers after stabilization if there are no contraindications, and I should initiate high-dose statin therapy early regardless of baseline LDL, as well as ACE inhibitors or ARBs and aldosterone antagonists when indicated for LV dysfunction or heart failure [^b86f0067].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly, frail, or has complex comorbidities. I should confirm that age alone should not dictate withholding reperfusion; rather, I should individualize decisions using a holistic, risk–benefit approach, and in patients≥ 75 years I should consider reduced-dose fibrinolytic regimens and transradial access to lower bleeding and vascular complications, while still pursuing PCI when feasible and timely [^1c6a925f] [^f003f52f]. I need to ensure that antithrombotic dosing is adjusted for renal function and that I account for frailty, cognitive status, and patient preferences in shared decision-making, especially when considering multivessel disease or surgical candidacy [^2afc4a5e].

> Next, I should review system-level quality metrics and transfer protocols, because outcomes hinge on process reliability. I should target door-to-balloon times within 90 minutes at PCI-capable centers and within 120 minutes when transferring, with EMS prenotification and cath lab activation to minimize delays, and for non–PCI-capable hospitals I should aim for door-to-needle within 30 minutes when fibrinolysis is indicated, with standardized order sets and feedback loops to close gaps [^c6677206] [^6261e614]. Hold on, I should verify that these benchmarks are linked to mortality differences; indeed, even modest delays in reperfusion correlate with higher mortality, reinforcing the need for continuous quality improvement and regional STEMI networks [^6bc4574a].

> I will now examine special scenarios that alter management. In cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel is indicated irrespective of time from symptom onset, and patients should be managed in centers with cardiac surgical capability when mechanical complications are suspected, with consideration of mechanical circulatory support in refractory cases [^7cf97a7e] [^96878f41]. For patients presenting 12–24 hours after symptom onset, PCI is reasonable if there is ongoing ischemia, high-risk features, or life-threatening arrhythmias, whereas stable patients with a totally occluded infarct-related artery beyond 24 hours without ischemia generally do not benefit from routine PCI, so I should confirm ischemia and viability before proceeding [^7cf97a7e]. In COVID-19 or other high-inflammatory states, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for STEMI mimics and true STEMI, balancing thrombotic and bleeding risks with guideline-concordant therapy and local protocols [^b16ac94f].

> Let me think about secondary prevention, because this is where long-term outcomes are determined. I should confirm that all patients receive high-intensity statin therapy unless contraindicated, continue DAPT for 12 months if bleeding risk allows, and implement comprehensive risk factor modification including blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation, diet, and exercise, with structured cardiac rehabilitation enrollment to reduce recurrent events and mortality [^b86f0067] [^02cb6b12]. I need to ensure that guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and ischemia is continued at discharge and reinforced in follow-up, as adherence gaps are common and drive worse outcomes [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge evidence gaps and areas of controversy so I do not overstate certainty. The role of multivessel PCI at the index procedure remains debated outside of cardiogenic shock, with ongoing uncertainty about complete revascularization strategies and timing, and while some guidelines allow culprit-first with staged revascularization, I should individualize based on anatomy, hemodynamics, and surgical candidacy [^cb34e775]. Similarly, the exact timing of angiography after fibrinolysis and the optimal antithrombotic regimen in specific subgroups still require nuanced judgment and shared decision-making, particularly in older adults and those with high bleeding risk [^notfound].

> To synthesize, I should double-check that my algorithm aligns with contemporary guidance: confirm STEMI with rapid ECG and troponin, assess time from symptom onset and PCI access, choose PCI within 90–120 minutes when feasible and otherwise give fibrinolysis with a pharmaco-invasive plan, administer guideline-directed antithrombotic and adjunctive therapy, manage special populations with individualized risk–benefit assessment, and embed quality metrics and secondary prevention into routine care, adjusting for evolving evidence and patient preferences at each step [^b090073b] [^84e5d767] [^7629ad2e].

STEMI is a **time-critical emergency** caused by complete coronary occlusion, requiring **immediate reperfusion** to limit infarct size and mortality [^a9e26381]. Primary PCI is the **preferred reperfusion strategy** when available within 90 minutes of first medical contact; if PCI is not available within 120 minutes, fibrinolysis should be given, followed by early angiography and PCI as needed [^b090073b] [^7629ad2e]. Early, potent dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) [^f6f9cdd7], anticoagulation, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors are essential adjuncts [^6b8049db]. Rapid ECG within 10 minutes [^511e8334], prehospital activation of PCI teams, and standardized transfer protocols reduce delays and improve outcomes [^6261e614]. Mortality is strongly linked to time-to-reperfusion; every 30-minute delay increases relative mortality by ~7.5% [^notfound], so **systems of care** and continuous quality improvement are critical [^1c44bbe9].

---

## Pathophysiology

STEMI results from **complete occlusion** of a coronary artery, usually due to plaque rupture and thrombosis, causing transmural ischemia and necrosis if reperfusion is delayed [^a9e26381]. Early reperfusion restores flow, limits infarct size, and reduces complications [^a9e26381].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Chest pain**: severe, crushing, retrosternal, radiating to the arm, jaw, or back, lasting> 20 minutes, unresponsive to nitrates [^notfound].
- **Autonomic symptoms**: diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, syncope.
- **Silent ischemia**: more common in diabetics, elderly, and women [^notfound].
- **ECG**: ST-segment elevation in contiguous leads or new LBBB [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, ECG, and biomarkers**:

| **Diagnostic tool** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| ECG | - ST-segment elevation≥ 1 mm in≥ 2 contiguous leads<br/> - New LBBB [^notfound] |
| Cardiac biomarkers | Elevated high-sensitivity troponin I or T [^2878aa48] |
| Clinical symptoms | Typical ischemic chest pain or equivalent [^2b7b57e9] |

## Initial management and reperfusion strategies

### Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

- **Preferred strategy**: when available within 90 minutes of first medical contact (FMC) [^b090073b].
- **Transfer**: if PCI is not available within 120 minutes, transfer for PCI or give fibrinolysis [^7629ad2e].
- **Adjuncts**: dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) [^f6f9cdd7], anticoagulation, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [^56279f03].

---

### Fibrinolysis

- **Indication**: when PCI is not available within 120 minutes and there are no contraindications [^7629ad2e].
- **Agents**: tenecteplase, alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase.
- **Adjuncts**: aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulation (enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin) [^3c571ced].
- **Pharmacoinvasive strategy**: routine angiography within 24 hours after lysis, with PCI if indicated [^d1a26b7f].

---

## Adjunctive medical therapy

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: aspirin 150–325 mg loading dose; P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel, ticagrelor, or clopidogrel) [^f6f9cdd7].
- **Anticoagulation**: unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, or bivalirudin during PCI [^ed9d3a58].
- **Beta-blockers**: start within 24 hours if no contraindications [^notfound].
- **Statins**: high-intensity statin regardless of LDL [^b86f0067].
- **ACE inhibitors**: start within 24 hours, especially with LV dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Common complications include:

- **Arrhythmias**: ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, conduction blocks [^notfound].
- **Mechanical complications**: papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal defect, free wall rupture [^notfound].
- **Cardiogenic shock**: high mortality, requires urgent revascularization [^7cf97a7e].
- **Pericarditis**: early or late [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **infarct size, reperfusion time, and comorbidities** [^a9e26381]. Early PCI achieves TIMI 3 flow in> 90% and reduces mortality, reinfarction, and stroke compared with fibrinolysis [^f7a6f1cc]. Mortality rises with delays: every 30-minute delay increases relative mortality by ~7.5% [^notfound].

---

## Regional and socioeconomic disparities

Disparities persist in access to PCI, reperfusion rates, and outcomes, with **worse outcomes in rural, low-income, and minority populations** [^f0c9ae37]. System-level initiatives and quality improvement programs are essential to close these gaps [^1c44bbe9].

---

## Current guidelines and quality metrics

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Rapid ECG**: within 10 minutes of presentation [^511e8334].
- **Door-to-balloon time**: ≤ 90 minutes at PCI-capable hospitals; ≤ 120 minutes if transfer is needed [^b090073b].
- **Door-to-needle time**: ≤ 30 minutes for fibrinolysis [^f7a6f1cc].
- **Continuous quality improvement**: track metrics, reduce delays, improve outcomes [^1c44bbe9].

---

STEMI care hinges on **rapid recognition, early reperfusion, and guideline-directed therapy**; **primary PCI is preferred** when timely, with fibrinolysis plus early angiography as the alternative. Outcomes are tightly linked to time-to-reperfusion, making systems of care and quality metrics indispensable [^a9e26381].

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a comprehensive review of contemporary management options [^1cdd204f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There are an estimated 500,000 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) events in the U.S. annually. Despite improvements in care, up to one-third of patients presenting with STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset still receive no reperfusion therapy acutely. Clinical studies indicate that speed of reperfusion after infarct onset may be more important than whether pharmacologic or mechanical intervention is used. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), when performed rapidly at high-volume centers, generally has superior efficacy to fibrinolysis, although fibrinolysis may be more suitable for many patients as an initial reperfusion strategy. Because up to 70% of STEMI patients present to hospitals without on-site PCI facilities, and prolonged door-to-balloon times due to inevitable transport delays commonly limit the benefit of PCI, the continued role and importance of the prompt, early use of fibrinolytic therapy may be underappreciated. Logistical complexities such as triage or transportation delays must be considered when a reperfusion strategy is selected, because prompt fibrinolysis may achieve greater benefit, especially if the fibrinolytic-to-PCI time delay associated with transfer exceeds approximately 1 h. Selection of a fibrinolytic requires consideration of several factors, including ease of dosing and combination with adjunctive therapies. Careful attention to these variables is critical to ensuring safe and rapid reperfusion, particularly in the prehospital setting. The emerging modality of pharmacoinvasive therapy, although controversial, seeks to combine the benefits of mechanical and pharmacologic reperfusion. Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide guidance regarding the utility of this strategy.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have issued a "focused update" of their 2004 guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Several of the issues addressed involve new data and new recommendations on treatment decisions that may be made in the emergency department. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the timely care of the STEMI patient.

### Myocardial infarction: contemporary management strategies [^fcb4f56c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common clinical diagnosis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, not only in the short term, but also years following the index event. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MI has ushered the era of multipronged treatment approach, with a combination of goal-directed revascularization, a broad adjunctive pharmacological therapy and aggressive secondary prevention measures. The goals of this article are to review the basic pathophysiological processes, which lead up to a clinical diagnosis of MI, to highlight the essential elements of clinical presentation and to summarize the evidence for comprehensive therapy. Emphasis has been placed on the choice of primary reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation MI, on risk-stratification of patients with non-ST elevation MI, and on rationale behind the selection of anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, evidence-based approach to secondary prevention is outlined.

### Contemporary challenges in the management of acute myocardial infarction: ST-elevation myocardial infarction guidelines and the real world [^802f8dff]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Timely reperfusion is the primary treatment goal for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines utilize time since symptom onset, anticipated time to treatment, patient risk factors, and center volume and experience to determine the optimal reperfusion strategy. There continues to be a considerable number of patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy and treatment delays are still too long. Institution-specific protocols which reflect current guidelines may increase the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who receive timely reperfusion.

### Evolving management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: update on recent data [^ec60e552]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Significant recent advances have been made in strategies for managing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Based on new findings, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have updated their guidelines for acute myocardial infarction (MI) with newer recommendations for STEMI management. Many of these recommendations focus on antithrombotic agents, with a movement toward lower doses of long-term aspirin and lower doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Studies have also been completed on the use of enoxaparin and fondaparinux as potential alternatives to heparin, and clinical trial data support the early use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (along with aspirin, UFH, and clopidogrel) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute STEMI. Clopidogrel has also been shown to improve angiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI who are undergoing thrombolysis or being treated medically. The new ACC/AHA recommendations support clopidogrel pretreatment and long-term therapy.

### Therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who present late or are ineligible for reperfusion therapy [^6963802d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the wide contemporary availability of pharmacological and mechanical means of reperfusion, a very significant proportion of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are still not offered any reperfusion therapy, and some of them are considered "ineligible for reperfusion." Spontaneous reperfusion and contraindications to the use of fibrinolytics and/or mechanical reperfusion methods account only for a small part of these clinical situations. The boundary between "timely" and "late" presentation in STEMI, the appropriateness of percutaneous intervention in patients presenting late after onset of symptoms, and the impact of sex and age on the eligibility and/or choice of reperfusion therapy continue to be challenged by the most recent published data. In the current invasive-driven reperfusion era, if scientific evidence and clinical guidelines are applied diligently, the vast majority of eligible STEMI patients should receive reperfusion therapy. Pharmacological nonlytic therapy of patients with STEMI, regardless of the choice of reperfusion strategy or the absence of it, is clearly defined by the current practice guidelines. Available data suggest that for patients who do not receive any form of reperfusion, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin provides a clear additional mortality benefit versus placebo. Fondaparinux as compared with usual care (unfractionated heparin infusion or placebo) significantly reduces the composite of death or myocardial reinfarction without increasing severe bleeding or number of strokes. In the treatment of late-presenting patients with STEMI (beyond the first 12 h after onset of symptoms), clinical evaluation and risk stratification represent the crucial elements helping in decision making between therapeutic interventions.

### Narrative review: reperfusion strategies for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^fb6cd62f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction depends on early diagnosis and rapid selection of the appropriate reperfusion strategy. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy at PCI-capable hospitals. For hospitals without PCI capability, there are 2 reperfusion strategies, primary PCI and thrombolytic therapy, which are both supported by clinical evidence and national guidelines. Transferring patients for primary PCI may cause delays and requires established, proven protocols, systems, and networks to achieve minimal door-to-balloon times. The authors review the available data and present a systematic, evidence-based approach in a simple framework to enable noncardiovascular and cardiovascular physicians to select the optimal reperfusion strategy. The framework is based on available data from clinical trials and local circumstances from clinical practice by incorporating duration of symptoms (fixed ischemia time) and anticipated transport delays to a PCI-capable facility (incurred ischemia time).

### ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^a9e26381]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most acute manifestation of coronary artery disease and is associated with great morbidity and mortality. A complete thrombotic occlusion developing from an atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary vessel is the cause of STEMI in the majority of cases. Early diagnosis and immediate reperfusion are the most effective ways to limit myocardial ischaemia and infarct size and thereby reduce the risk of post-STEMI complications and heart failure. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with STEMI; if PCI cannot be performed within 120minutes of STEMI diagnosis, fibrinolysis therapy should be administered to dissolve the occluding thrombus. The initiation of networks to provide around-the-clock cardiac catheterization availability and the generation of standard operating procedures within hospital systems have helped to reduce the time to reperfusion therapy. Together with new advances in antithrombotic therapy and preventive measures, these developments have resulted in a decrease in mortality from STEMI. However, a substantial amount of patients still experience recurrent cardiovascular events after STEMI. New insights have been gained regarding the pathophysiology of STEMI and feed into the development of new treatment strategies.

### Resource and infrastructure-appropriate management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in low-and middle-income countries [^35ccedda]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The 143 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the world constitute 80% of the world's population or roughly 5.86 billion people with much variation in geography, culture, literacy, financial resources, access to health care, insurance penetration, and healthcare regulation. Unfortunately, their burden of cardiovascular disease in general and acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in particular is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Compounding the problem, outcomes remain suboptimal because of a lack of awareness and a severe paucity of resources. Guideline-based treatment has dramatically improved the outcomes of STEMI in high-income countries. However, no such focused recommendations exist for LMICs, and the unique challenges in LMICs make directly implementing Western guidelines unfeasible. Thus, structured solutions tailored to their individual, local needs, and resources are a vital need. With this in mind, a multicountry collaboration of investigators interested in LMIC STEMI care have tried to create a consensus document that extracts transferable elements from Western guidelines and couples them with local realities gathered from expert experience. It outlines general operating principles for LMICs focused best practices and is intended to create the broad outlines of implementable, resource-appropriate paradigms for management of STEMI in LMICs. Although this document is focused primarily on governments and organizations involved with improvement in STEMI care in LMICs, it also provides some specific targeted information for the frontline clinicians to allow standardized care pathways and improved outcomes.

### Reperfusion therapy for STEMI: is there still a role for thrombolysis in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention? [^7bac97d1]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

In the past ten years, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has replaced thrombolysis as the revascularisation strategy for many patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, delivery of primary PCI within evidence-based timeframes is challenging, and health-care provision varies substantially worldwide. Consequently, even with the ideal circumstances of rapid initial diagnosis, long transfer delays to the catheter laboratory can occur. These delays are detrimental to outcomes for patients and can be exaggerated by variations in timing of patients' presentation and diagnosis. In this Series paper we summarise the value of immediate out-of-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI, and reconsider the potential therapeutic interface with a contemporary service for primary PCI. We review recent trial data, and explore opportunities for optimisation of STEMI outcomes with a pharmacoinvasive approach.

### 2012 ESC STEMI guidelines and reperfusion therapy: evidence base ignored, threatening optimal patient management [^a9a6f706]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

We recommend that for future guidelines, professional societies on both sides of the Atlantic acknowledge the current confusion about the terminologies on treatment delays in STEMI and uncertainties in utilising available data for information regarding the proper treatment for various patient subsets, and avoid recommendations that may have deleterious consequences. It is uncertain whether a pharmacoinvasive strategy in the future will qualify as an alternative reperfusion strategy. However, the Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial found no mortality benefit but an increased risk of stroke in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy compared to patients randomised to a PPCI strategy.

### Recommendation to develop strategies to increase the number of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with timely access to primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^91daf247]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Although evidence suggests that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy in the majority of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), only a minority of patients with STEMI are treated with primary PCI, and of those, only a minority receive the treatment within the recommended 90 minutes after entry into the medical system. Market research conducted by the American Heart Association revealed that those involved in the care of patients with STEMI recognize the multiple barriers that prevent the prompt delivery of primary PCI and agree that it is necessary to develop systems or centers of care that will allow STEMI patients to benefit from primary PCI. The American Heart Association will convene a group of stakeholders (representing the interests of patients, physicians, emergency medical systems, community hospitals, tertiary hospitals, and payers) and quality-of-care and outcomes experts to identify the gaps between the existing and ideal delivery of care for STEMI patients, as well as the requisite policy implications. Working within a framework of guiding principles, the group will recommend strategies to increase the number of STEMI patients with timely access to primary PCI.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to transfer, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to transfer patients with STEMI and an estimated time from first medical contact to device activation of ≤ 120 minutes, or those with a contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy, to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Pharmaco-invasive strategy: the answer to improving ST-elevation-myocardial infarction care [^7c3030ac]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a leading cause of death worldwide, 1 and immediate reperfusion can be life‐saving. 2 Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most effective modality for achieving reperfusion in STEMI, 2, 3 the benefit of primary PCI over thrombolytics on survival is time‐dependent. Prior studies have showed that the survival benefit of primary PCI over thrombolytics may be negated if PCI‐related delay exceeds by >60 minutes. 4 Accordingly, national quality improvement initiatives during the past decade have focused on reducing delays in primary PCI, especially in patients who present directly to a PCI‐capable hospital. 5

However, availability of primary PCI for STEMI patients remains uneven. In the United States, only one third of acute care hospitals have 24×7 PCI capability and nearly 20% of the population lives >60 minutes from a PCI capable facility. 6 Among all STEMI patients, ≈30% initially present to a non‐PCI capable hospital. 7 Access to primary PCI is substantially worse in low‐ to middle‐income countries where cardiac catheterization services are largely confined to big cities leaving vast swaths of the population out of the coverage area. For example, in India, 70% of the 1.3 billion population lives in rural areas and the nearest cardiac catheterization laboratory may be hundreds of miles away. 8 Even in major cities, access to a PCI‐capable hospital is often limited by long transport times and lack of efficient transfer protocols. 8

Given the challenges in providing timely access to primary PCI to STEMI, alternative reperfusion options for patients who initially present to non‐PCI capable hospitals are important. These approaches include use of thrombolytics alone, or a hybrid approach—use of thrombolytics up front followed by invasive angiography either immediately (facilitated PCI), or after a waiting period of 3 to 24 hours (pharmaco‐invasive approach). Given that thrombolytics alone fail to achieve reperfusion in ≈30% of patients and another 30% may experience recurrence of ischemia and ST elevation following initial reperfusion, 9, 10 a hybrid approach is attractive because it combines the immediate availability of thrombolytic therapy, with the higher success rate of mechanical reperfusion upon transfer to PCI‐capable centers. While, numerous randomized controlled trials over the past 2 decades have compared individual strategies for STEMI management, head‐to‐head trials comparing pharmaco‐invasive strategy with facilitated PCI have been lacking.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in EDs [^3c571ced]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) physicians are critical in the accurate diagnosis, efficient management, and treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The initial reperfusion strategy involves the choice between mechanical reperfusion using primary percutaneous coronary intervention and pharmacologic treatment with fibrinolytics. The benefits of these approaches are time dependent, and practices vary according to institutional resources and local guidelines. Nevertheless, the need for early intervention and the use of certain therapies are well recognized. Therefore, ED physicians must be aware of all treatment options available, including the use of adjunctive therapies. Initial treatment should include beta-blockers, aspirin (or clopidogrel if aspirin is contraindicated), nitroglycerin, and analgesia, regardless of reperfusion strategy. Clopidogrel is now approved as an adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing fibrinolysis as their reperfusion therapy. Both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are feasible adjunctives in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing reperfusion therapy. In addition, multiple new antithrombin agents are being investigated. The choice adjunctive treatments should be based on specific patient populations and on the initial reperfusion strategy.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to fibrinolytic therapy, administration, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to administer fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI and symptom onset of < 12 hours, with an anticipated delay to primary PCI ≥ 120 minutes from first medical contact, in the absence of contraindications, to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Natural history and clinical outcomes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without stent insertion [^62a2a1c2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

After restoration of coronary perfusion in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), discrete severe stenotic coronary lesions are not always apparent. There remains ambiguity whether drug-eluting stent (DES) insertion or initial medical management is best practice. We sought to assess short-term clinical outcomes in patients presenting with STEMI without initial stent insertion. Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI between 2014 and 2020 were prospectively enrolled and assessed for inclusion. Patients presenting with in-stent restenosis or stent thrombosis, or who did not survive to hospital discharge were excluded. Of 13,871 patients presenting, 456 (3.3%) were treated without initial stenting. These patients were older than those treated with DES (66.1 ± 13.6 vs 62.3 ± 12.4 years, p <0.001), had higher rates of diabetes (23.5% vs 16.0%, p <0.001) and previous revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (14.0% vs 7.3%, p <0.001) or coronary artery bypass graft (3.5% vs 1.8%, p = 0.008). Thirty-day mortality was elevated in patients treated without stenting compared to those receiving DES (4.2% vs 0.9%, p <0.001), as were rates of myocardial infarction (1.3% vs 0.5%, p = 0.026) and major adverse cardiac events (10.5% vs 2.4%, p <0.001). After propensity matching, a trend toward increased mortality remained (4.2% vs 2.0%, p = 0.055). In conclusion, a no-stenting initial strategy, compared with DES insertion, is associated with increased 30-day mortality in those presenting with STEMI without severe stenosis. These data suggest when appropriate, current-generation DES insertion should be undertaken.

Conclusions

Primary PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI. Our findings suggest that when primary PCI is unavailable as a reperfusion therapy, a pharmacoinvasive approach is superior to facilitated PCI or standard fibrinolytic therapy in terms of mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. This information will help guide better design of STEMI systems of care across diverse healthcare systems for this important disease condition.

### Current perspectives on reperfusion therapy for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: integrating pharmacologic and mechanical reperfusion strategies [^ce6c3031]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The therapeutic approach to patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has advanced rapidly over the past decade. Intravenous fibrinolytic therapy remains the most common form of reperfusion therapy worldwide, since fibrinolytics are associated with a dramatic reduction in mortality rates. However, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with improved outcomes and less bleeding complications compared with fibrinolytic therapy, but it is not widely available. Adjunctive therapies with intracoronary stents, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and more potent antithrombin agents have shown great promise for the initial treatment of STEMI and have stimulated further investigation of combined pharmacological/mechanical reperfusion strategies that may be synergistic. Although the optimal combination of fibrinolytics, antiplatelet agents, antithrombins, and mechanical reperfusion at hospitals with and without primary PCI facilities remains elusive, results from recent studies suggest that such a combined approach may facilitate transfer of patients with STEMI from a referral hospital to an invasive hospital for definitive primary PCI after administration of a potent pharmacologic regimen designed to enhance early infarct-related artery reperfusion. Thus, as the reperfusion era continues to evolve, the ideal treatment strategy for patients with STEMI is being redefined to integrate pharmacologic and mechanical approaches to reperfusion.

### Interventional management of acute coronary syndromes: applying the lessons of ST-elevation services to non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^f8612f4f]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Many countries have embarked on national strategies to translate evidence from trials of reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) into clinical practice. Primary angioplasty has become the dominant mode of reperfusion, but the best outcomes depend on appropriate service re-configurations to ensure rapid, effective and comprehensive treatment. Although there are many differences in the treatment of STEMI and non-STEMI acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there are many parallels. Many of the changes in the system of care for STEMI patients could now be applied to the non-STEMI ACS population, providing faster and more efficient care and promising to deliver better outcomes. This article highlights additional changes to healthcare services that should be considered.

Ultimately, timely patient selection for invasive strategy in older people with STEMI remains a challenge in daily routine. Age itself should not per se determine the allocation to a treatment strategy as even older people might be long‐term survivors.A prospective randomized controlled trial assessing the optimized treatment strategy of older patients with STEMI is desired. But recruitment could become an insuperable challenge,and extensive screening efforts could be anticipated from comparable AMI trials in older patients.Beyond the well‐established end points the use of patient‐oriented outcomes might add further value because a potential gain or loss in quality of life might contribute to decision making.

Methods

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We gathered data from randomized controlled trials of patients with STEMI, presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset, in which any of the following treatments were compared: primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy, and fibrinolysis followed by routine early (ie, within 24 hours) invasive therapy.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, from January 1, 1999, to March 20, 2019, using the following key words: “primary angioplasty,” “primary percutaneous coronary intervention,” “facilitated angioplasty,” “facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention,” “pharmacoinvasive,” “acute myocardial infarction,” “ST elevation myocardial infarction,” and “ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction.” We restricted our search to studies following 1999 to focus on those trials that used contemporary management strategies for PCI. We excluded trials that did not routinely use stenting during PCI (use of stents in <50% of coronary interventions) and those without follow‐up beyond hospital discharge.

We only included reports published in English. We performed our search on March 20, 2019, and identified 62 reports that were reviewed by 2 independent readers (R.F. T.I.J.), with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (B.K.N.).

Data Extraction and Definition of the Reperfusion Strategies

We extracted data regarding study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical short‐term outcomes, number of patients enrolled, and time delay intervals. The primary clinical end points we abstracted were death, nonfatal reinfarction, stroke, and major bleeding at 30 to 90 days. In all cases, we used the definitions utilized within the individual trials to define these outcomes. These definitions as well as details of protocols for each trial are outlined in Table S1.

We defined primary PCI as immediate PCI without prior administration of fibrinolytics. For our primary analysis, in accordance with time thresholds discussed in the 2017 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for STEMI management, we categorized routine early PCI after fibrinolysis as facilitated PCI when the average time interval between administration of fibrinolytics and PCI was <2 hours and as a pharmacoinvasive approach when this interval was ≥2 hours. We did not consider pretreatment of STEMI before PCI with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors without fibrinolysis as either facilitated PCI or a pharmacoinvasive approach.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f003f52f]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion in older adults—preferred strategy, timelines, and key adjuncts: American and European society guidelines recommend primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as the preferred reperfusion strategy in all acute STEMI when symptom onset to first medical contact is <12 hours, with door-to-balloon time <90 minutes or anticipated transfer to reperfusion time <120 minutes (Class 1; Level of Evidence A). If pPCI is not possible, it is recommended that older patients should receive fibrinolysis when appropriate; trials demonstrated the importance of half-dose fibrinolytic therapy in patients ≥75 years and that in elderly patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset when pPCI was not available within 1 hour, half-dose fibrinolysis had similar safety and efficacy compared with pPCI. As adjunctive therapy with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel should be considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, with patients >75 years receiving an initial dose of 75 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily; for access during pPCI, transradial access has been proven safe in older patients and should be considered the preferred access site to lower bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and perhaps death in STEMI.

Overall, there is conflicting data and no concrete evidence exists for any single strategy over the other in this specific population. The risk–benefit ratio may differ in this subset and perhaps an improved selection of patients who would benefit the most from invasive management using initial non-invasive means may prove useful. Our study is limited by its small number and a retrospective observational design and a significant selection bias cannot be removed. It does not have the power to draw any definitive conclusions; however, it does raise questions about the best management strategy in this particular cohort, and highlights the vacuum in evidence. A randomised trial may be able to answer this question in future.

### What is the optimum adjunctive reperfusion strategy for primary percutaneous coronary intervention? [^032de5f6]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a dynamic, thrombus-driven event. As understanding of its pathophysiology has improved, the central role of platelets in initiation and orchestration of this process has become clear. Key components of STEMI include formation of occlusive thrombus, mediation and ultimately amplification of the local vascular inflammatory response resulting in increased vasoreactivity, oedema formation, and microvascular obstruction. Activation, degranulation, and aggregation of platelets are the platforms from which these components develop. Therefore, prompt, potent, and predictable antithrombotic therapy is needed to optimise clinical outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We review present pharmacological and mechanical adjunctive therapies for reperfusion and ask what is the optimum combination when primary percutaneous coronary intervention is used as the mode of revascularisation in patients with STEMI.

### The pharmaco-invasive approach to STEMI: when should fibrinolytic-treated patients go to the "cath lab"? [^b3a5dda3]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in clinical trials has lower rates of reinfarction, stroke and mortality than fibrinolytic therapy, because of system delays in routine practice, field triage and prehospital administration of fibrinolytic therapy may lead to similar clinical outcomes, especially in those patients who present in the first 2 h after symptom onset. Necessary for these outcomes is the liberal use of both rescue PCI and in-hospital revascularisation. Non-invasive prediction of failed reperfusion may be enhanced by the use of ST recovery, patient characteristics and troponin T levels, measured by point-of-care assays. This review focuses on the timing of, and indications for, an invasive strategy after fibrinolytic therapy, including that for failed pharmacological reperfusion.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: sorting through type 1 vs other types [^96780e9a]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The objective of current NSTEMI management guidelines is to provide recommendations for the relief of ischemia during hospitalization and, in the longer term, to prevent secondary events such as recurrent MI, events in other vascular beds, and death. 1, 3 All NSTEMI events should initially be diagnosed and managed in accordance with these guidelines regardless of MI type. However, current NSTEMI guidelines are more suited to type 1 NSTEMI than type 2 NSTEMI. Recent guidelines for MI classification have attempted to address this by providing an algorithmic approach to understanding the mechanistic basis for the occurrence of type 2 NSTEMI to facilitate appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to address this unmet need in the treatment of the older, sicker patient with a type 2 NSTEMI. Meanwhile, given the preponderance of type 1 MI over type 2 MI in patients presenting with NSTEMI, and given the increased intermediate‐ and long‐term risk of major adverse CV events relative to STEMI, aggressive strategies need to be adopted in treating these patients. These include the appropriate use of early invasive approaches, antithrombotic agents that yield the best benefit‐risk outcomes, and other guideline‐directed therapies. On the other side, algorithms that address the multiple possible underlying causes for the myocardial oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in individual patients may be preferable for managing patients with type 2 NSTEMI. Future guidelines should include appropriate evidence‐based recommendations for the management of type 2 NSTEMI.

### Acute myocardial infarction [^3b6d2014]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction has traditionally been divided into ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; however, therapies are similar between the two, and the overall management of acute myocardial infarction can be reviewed for simplicity. Acute myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite substantial improvements in prognosis over the past decade. The progress is a result of several major trends, including improvements in risk stratification, more widespread use of an invasive strategy, implementation of care delivery systems prioritising immediate revascularisation through percutaneous coronary intervention (or fibrinolysis), advances in antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and greater use of secondary prevention strategies such as statins. This seminar discusses the important topics of the pathophysiology, epidemiological trends, and modern management of acute myocardial infarction, focusing on the recent advances in reperfusion strategies and pharmacological treatment approaches.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^6261e614]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prehospital assessment and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) emphasize early electrocardiography (ECG) and EMS-directed STEMI pathways. In patients with suspected ACS, a 12-lead ECG should be acquired and interpreted within 10 minutes of first medical contact (FMC) to identify patients with STEMI. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic of STEMI, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates. For suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), immediate emergency medical services (EMS) transport to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI (PPCI) is the recommended triage strategy, with an FMC-to-first-device time system goal of ≤90 minutes, and early advance notification of the receiving PCI-capable hospital by EMS personnel and activation of the cardiac catheterization team is recommended to reduce time to reperfusion.

### Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: an overview of current status [^507f1d52]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Several randomized trials and meta-analyses have shown that primary angioplasty is superior to thrombolysis in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) in terms of death, reinfarction, and stroke. However, primary angioplasty should be regarded as the preferred strategy as long as it can not be applied with a reasonable time delay to treatment, as compared with the administration of thrombolysis. In fact, time-to-treatment has been shown to be a determinant of survival not only for thrombolysis but also for primary angioplasty. Recent guidelines consider a time from first medical contact to PCI of 90 minutes or a PCI-related delay of 60 minutes as reasonable cutoffs to identify the best reperfusion strategy. The beneficial effects of primary angioplasty could be expected particularly after the first 3 hours from symptom onset, when thrombolysis, particularly streptokinase, may be less effective, whereas within the first 3 hours, thrombolysis (started in the prehospital setting, preferably) may represent a valid therapeutic option. Because the survival benefits of primary angioplasty depends on the patient's risk profile and timely application of reperfusion, we would suggest, among patients in the first hours from symptom onset, a strategy of early pharmacologic reperfusion and transfer to primary PCI centers, where the decision of performing angiography acutely may be based on the assessment of myocardial reperfusion and risk profile, whereas after the first 3 hours from symptoms onset, primary angioplasty should be considered the preferred strategy if applicable, particularly in regions when streptokinase still represents the only available lytic therapy. However, even though primary angioplasty is able to achieve thrombolysis and TIMI 3 flow in most patients, a still relevant proportion of patients experience poor myocardial reperfusion, with negative impact on acute and long-term survival. The use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex inhibitors has significantly improved survival, with additional benefits obtained by early administration aiming at early reperfusion, which are to be recommended, particularly among high-risk patients and those presenting within the first hours from symptom onset. The use of adjunctive mechanical devices has reduced the incidence of distal embolization without any apparent benefit in survival. Until the results of larger randomized trials become available, these devices may be considered in patients at high risk for distal embolization, such as those with large thrombotic burden. The use of coronary stenting has significantly reduced restenosis, as compared with balloon angioplasty. Several randomized trials have recently been conducted on drug-eluting stents in ST-segment elevation MI, showing the safety and significant benefits of these devices in terms of restenosis, as compared with bare metal stents (BMSs). However, because of unpredictable compliance to long-term double oral antiplatelet therapy in acute patients, caution should be taken with extensive use of drug-eluting stents in primary angioplasty.

Initiate a PPI in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Contemporary approach to the diagnosis and management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^fa21f87d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has evolved dramatically over the past decade and, in many respects, represents a rapidly moving target for the cardiologist and internist who seek to integrate these recent advances into contemporary clinical practice. Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) comprise a growing percentage of patients with ACS and is emerging as a major public health problem worldwide, especially in Western countries, despite significant improvements and refinements in management over the past 20 years. Against this backdrop of a multitude of randomized, controlled clinical trials that have established the scientific foundation upon which evidence-based treatment strategies have emerged and become increasingly refined, the clinician is frequently confronted with panoply of choices that can create uncertainty or confusion regarding "optimal management". While the debate about the ideal approach to the management of non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS (i.e., routine "early invasive strategy" versus an "ischemia-guided", or "conservative", strategy) has been ongoing for over a decade, clinical trials results provide compelling evidence that intermediate- and high-risk ACS patients derived significant reductions in both morbidity and mortality with mechanical or surgical intervention, especially when revascularization is coupled with aggressive, multifaceted (anti-platelet, antithrombin, anti-ischemic and anti-atherogenic) medical therapy along with risk factor modification. For these reasons, it seems especially timely and appropriate to present a state-of-the-art paper that reviews the latest advances in the management of NSTE ACS, mindful of the fact that even this noble effort to synthesize and integrate a prodigious amount of scientific information and cardiovascular therapeutics is destined to evolve still further as our full-scale assault on optimizing clinical outcomes by harmonizing the advances in mechanical and pharmacologic interventions continues unabated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps—initial evaluation and management: Although the 2025 ACS guideline recognizes the value of risk scores in estimating the risk of death or recurrent MI, limited prospective randomized data are available as to whether risk scores should be used to determine treatment strategies. The highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest, and although the data support an invasive approach in resuscitated patients with ST-segment elevation on the postarrest ECG, any potential benefit of coronary angiography may be attenuated in those who are comatose. It is also less clear whether reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical benefit in ST-segment elevation patients who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but who are no longer symptomatic.

### Treatment patterns and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction for low-and high-income patients (...) [^f0c9ae37]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this study of 289 376 patients aged 66 years or older hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 843 046 hospitalized with non-STEMI across 6 health systems, adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher for low-income patients, whereas rates of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary interventions were lower. High-income patients also had shorter length of stay and lower rates of readmissions. We studied 289 376 patients hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 843 046 hospitalized with non-STEMI. Adjusted 30-day mortality generally was 1 to 3 percentage points lower for high-income patients. For instance, 30-day mortality among patients admitted with STEMI in the Netherlands was 10. 2% for those with high income vs
13. 1% for those with low income. The largest differences in 30-day mortality were seen in Canada for STEMI and Israel for NSTEMI. LOS was generally shorter for high- vs low-income patients for both STEMI and NSTEMI except for Israel and Taiwan. Thirty-day readmission rates were consistently lower for higher-income patients for both STEMI and NSTEMI. Age- and sex-standardized readmission rates are shown in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. The mortality differences identified in this study were substantial, including differences in 30-day mortality for STEMI in the almost all countries that were 2 to 3 percentage points higher for low-income patients. For context, a 2% to 3% absolute difference in mortality is similar to or exceeds the mortality benefits afforded by treatment innovations such as primary PCI or thrombolytic therapy.

31, 32 That low-income patients were treated less aggressively, with lower rates of both cardiac catheterization and revascularization, may be a potential explanation for worse outcomes.

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^98adfec0]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a significant global public health concern. Practice guidelines in both the United States and Europe have been major contributors to providing evidence-based care. Rapid advances in contemporary therapies mandate regular and timely updates to guideline recommendations. In the fall of 2012, the European Society of Cardiology published their latest guidelines for the management of STEMI. In 2013 (∼3 months later), the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association jointly published their most recent STEMI guideline statements. In this review, we compare the transatlantic guidelines, highlighting differences in their recommendations and the interpretation of evidence addressing STEMI care.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: comparison of the updated guidelines from north America and Europe [^c1e39fca]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology each recently published updated guidelines for management of patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. In this article, we highlight the most important new recommendations, review their supporting data, and describe differences between the guidelines. Key aspects of these updates include detailed guidance regarding the selection of a reperfusion strategy and the incorporation of newer adjunctive antithrombotic agents. Both new guidelines suggest caution in the administration of intravenous beta-blockers, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and support a more aggressive approach to secondary risk factor management. The 2 guidelines have some nuanced differences as well as some recommendations that are unique to each guideline. They present different levels of support for the 4 available adjunctive parenteral anticoagulants, vary in their endorsement of routine elective coronary angiography after fibrinolysis, and cite different targets for low density lipoprotein long-term. Major unique recommendations include the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocaition's emphasis of a stepped approach to analgesia in patients with musculoskeletal pain beginning with acetaminophen or aspirin and a lower target international normalized ratio in patients receiving warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. Meanwhile, unique recommendations in the European Society of Cardiology guidelines include measures to prevent/treat microvascular obstruction and reperfusion injury associated with percutaneous coronary intervention and greater emphasis on maintaining eugylcemia. As these guidelines represent an evidence based approach, health care providers should become familiar with the new data and the resultant updated recommendations to ensure optimal treatment of their patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^9c5ad9c5]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

SCAI Expert Consensus Statement—management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is scoped to best practices for cardiac catheterization laboratory team readiness, arterial access with an algorithm to help determine proper arterial access in STEMI, and diagnostic angiography, and it highlights the strengths and limitations of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the catheterization laboratory; it reviews different options to manage large thrombus burden during STEMI and the management of STEMI across various anatomical and clinical circumstances, with sections including optimal techniques for angiography and intervention (arterial access, diagnostic assessment, initial approach to PCI), managing thrombus, managing no-reflow, intracoronary imaging, emerging approaches to reduce infarct size, special circumstances (cardiogenic shock, STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy, multivessel coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft), anatomical subsets (coronary calcification, bifurcation lesions, coronary aneurysms/ectasia), nonatherosclerotic causes of STEMI (epicardial vasospasm, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, coronary embolism, myocardial infarction without obstructive coronary arteries), and quality of care and outcomes; the abstract notes that timely reperfusion with primary PCI is associated with improved outcomes.

### Improving door-to-needle times for patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction at a rural district general hospital [^f7a6f1cc]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Influencing our study is the finding that a major independent predictor of early death from STEMI is time to reperfusion.The fundamental approach to the management of STEMI in New Zealand includes early recognition, appropriate and timely delivery of reperfusion therapy and implementation of secondary prevention recommendations.International guidelines are clear in specifying that patients with acute STEMI should receive coronary reperfusion therapy with either primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis.Shorter time to reperfusion is associated with better survival for STEMI patients, whether they receive thrombolysis or PCI.Furthermore, regional medical systems and protocols should seek to enable rapid recognition and timely reperfusion of STEMI patients. Depending on the available in-hospital facilities, the goal for patients with STEMI should be to achieve a door-to-needle time within 30 minutes (for thrombolysis) and a door-to-balloon time within 90 minutes (for PCI).On inference from a range of randomised clinical trials, timely PCI has become the optimal strategy for the treatment of STEMI. For example, primary PCI can achieve Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-3 flow in the infarct artery in >90% of patients and has a clear advantage over fibrinolytic therapy, which can achieve TIMI-3 flow in only 54%.However, thrombolysis should be used if timely PCI is not available, and is capable of re-establishing antegrade blood flow in nearly 75% of patients when administered within 30 minutes of presentation.This is certainly appropriate for non-PCI capable hospitals such as ours, where access to a cardiac catheterisation lab is over 2 hours drive away.

Acute coronary syndromes—revascularization strategy in multivessel disease highlights evidence gaps: in patients with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the role of multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus culprit-only PCI needs further supportive data, and whether multivessel PCI should be guided by angiography or physiology is still a matter of debate; it also clarifies that recommendations for PCI of nonculprit arteries in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are for patients who are not intended for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and that the optimal strategy for those with more complex anatomy is less clear.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^2f602915]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that includes unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels as well as a review of past medical history. Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, and HmG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

### Meta-analysis on invasive versus conservative strategy in patients older than seventy years with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^72054d31]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) has evolved over the years, but most published data are from younger patients. Data on the NSTEMI management in older patients remain limited. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the long-term outcomes of invasive versus conservative strategies in older patients (>70 years old) with NSTEMI. Of 1,550 reports searched, 4 randomized controlled trials (1,126 patients) were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up of 1.25 years (range: 1 to 2.5 years). The median age of included patients was 83.6 (interquartile range: 2.8 years). The invasive strategy was associated with significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (odds ratio [OR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.91, I 2 = 54%; 3 trials] and unplanned revascularization (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.64, I 2 = 1.7%; 3 trials] than was the conservative strategy. There was no difference in all-cause mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.18, I 2 = 0%; 4 trials], myocardial infarction (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.19, I 2 = 54.7%; 4 trials], or bleeding (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.93, I 2 = 0%; 3 trials] between the strategies. In conclusion, the use of initial invasive strategy in older patients presenting with NSTEMI was associated with a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event and unplanned revascularization than that of the initial conservative strategy without increased bleeding.

As the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 continues to increase, there is an increasing possibility that patients with COVID-19 may presen with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With social distancing and restricted access to preventive healthcare and emergency services, the management of acute cardiac emergencies such as myocardial infarction has suffered collateral damage. Thus far, global trends suggest a decrease in STEMI activations with possible worse outcomes due to delayed presentation and management. In this review, we discuss the challenges to STEMI management in the COVID-19 era and provide potential solutions for adherence to evidence-based therapies as the pandemic progresses into the year 2021.

### Abstract (...) [^1ea92df0]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome encompasses a spectrum of coronary artery diseases, including unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and non-STEMI. The term “acute coronary syndrome” is useful because the initial presentation and early management of unstable angina, STEMI, and NSTEMI frequently are similar. Any patient with a history suggestive of acute coronary syndrome should be evaluated in a facility that has ECG and cardiac monitoring equipment. 7 Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who have chest pain at rest for more than 20 minutes, syncope/presyncope, or unstable vital signs should be referred to an emergency department immediately. 7 The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, which includes both STEMI and NSTEMI, requires at least two of the following: ischemic symptoms, diagnostic ECG changes, and serum cardiac marker elevation.

8, 9. The magnitude of an ECG abnormality affects diagnostic accuracy. One group of investigators 13 found that the diagnosis of NSTEMI is greater than three times more likely in patients with chest pain whose ECG showed ST-segment depression in three or more leads or ST-segment depressions that were greater than or equal to 0. 2 mV. DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES Subendocardial ischemia classically results in ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion. 14 Approximately 25 percent of patients with ST-segment depression and elevated creatine kinase–MB isoenzyme levels eventually develop STEMI, and 75 percent have NSTEMI. Transmural myocardial ischemia results in ST-segment elevation with the vector shifted toward the involved epicardial layer, and without treatment typically results in STEMI. Occasionally, “reciprocal” ST-segment depression occurs in leads that are electrically opposite to the area of injury.

Although the ECG may be completely normal in a patient with myocardial ischemia and evolving infarction, classic ECG changes occur in STEMI. 14 Within minutes, there is J-point elevation, and tall, peaked, “hyperacute” T waves develop; ST-segment elevation and reciprocal-lead ST-segment depression also occur. Abnormal Q waves usually develop within the first day, and T-wave inversion and normalization of ST segments occur within hours to days. 9 Characteristics of the most important serum cardiac markers are summarized in Table 3. 16–19.

### Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the United States: contemporary trends in incidence, utilization of the early invasive strategy, and in-hospital outcomes [^eff6e3d7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality.Data from the United States and Europe have reported a decrease in the incidence of ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with an increase in non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the past decade. – Current 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend early invasive strategy (EIS) for management of patients with NSTEMI and refractory angina or electrical or hemodynamic insufficiency (class IB), initially stabilized patients with NSTEMI, and high risk of clinical events (class IA). The early invasive approach (within 12 to 24 hours of presentation) to reduce ischemic complications is also recommended in initially stabilized high‐risk patients with NSTEMI (class IIA).The optimal timing of EIS has been debated and undergone a paradigm shift in the last decade. The transition from 48 hours to within 24 hours occurred after the publication of the Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes (TIMACS) trial in 2009. – However, there is a paucity of information with regard to the secular trends in utilization of EIS in patients with NSTEMI and how this may vary among different NSTEMI patient populations. Using a large nationwide administrative database, the present study aimed to analyze and describe age‐, sex‐, and race/ethnicity‐specific trends in the incidence, utilization of EIS, and in‐hospital outcomes for NSTEMI in the United States from 2002 to 2011.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, “A” relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), “C” considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and “S” for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

PPCI in STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals—classed recommendations and timing: In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting ≤12 hours after symptom onset, PPCI should be performed with a goal of first medical contact (FMC) to device activation of ≤90 minutes, or ≤120 minutes in patients requiring hospital transfer, to improve survival. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel by PCI or CABG is indicated to improve survival, irrespective of time from symptom onset. In patients with STEMI presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients with STEMI presenting >24 hours after symptom onset with the presence of ongoing ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients who are stable with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct-related artery >24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI should not be performed due to lack of benefit.

### The ideal anticoagulation strategy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^9c506294]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Heparin has been the principal anticoagulant in the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but has several limitations. Although glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been major adjuncts in previous years, in the era of novel P2Y12 receptor inhibitors they may have a greater role in bailout. Low molecular weight heparins have been extensively studied in fibrinolysis trials but data in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are scarce. The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin overcomes several shortcomings of heparins and has demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding outcomes and net adverse cardiac events at the cost of increased acute stent thrombosis. This review discusses the pharmacology and clinical trial evidence for different anticoagulant treatment options in STEMI with a proposed selection strategy in contemporary primary PCI.

### Immediate and early percutaneous coronary intervention in very high-risk and high-risk non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients [^529051eb]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the acute form of ischemic heart disease, which is the leading cause of death globally.This definition of ACS ranges from ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to non‐STEMI (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA).Immediate primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) is the gold standard for the treatment of STEMI.By contrast, routine use of coronary angiography, and its timing, in NSTEMI patients is still debatable.Several meta‐analyses support the role of a routine early (<24 h) PCI in reducing the risk of composite ischemic outcomes, particularly in high‐risk patients.,Moreover, randomized controlled trials have shown that very high‐risk and high‐risk NSTEMI patients may benefit from an early invasive strategy.Accordingly, the last two European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (2015, 2020) for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST‐segment elevation (NSTEMI) recommend an immediate and early routine PCI in very high‐risk and high‐risk NSTEMI patients, respectively.We aim to examine adherence to these recommendations in a nationwide survey.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^daa445a1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Improving door-to-needle times for patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction at a rural district general hospital [^6bc4574a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

System delays to reperfusion are correlated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity.Successful delivery of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Guidelines in the management of STEMI is associated with a 2.9% in-hospital mortality for < 30 minutes compared with 4.1% for 31-45 minutes and 6.2% for > 45 minutes.Furthermore, the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project 30-day mortality significantly increased from 12.5% for those treated within 30 minutes, to 14.1% for those treated 31-90 minutes and 19.9% for those treated after 90 minutes.Issues with poor adherence to the ACC guidelines have been identified by McNamara et al.who found that only 46% of patients were treated within 30 minutes. Previous BMJ quality improvement projects have demonstrated reducing door-to-balloon time for acute STEMI in PCI-capable centres but none appear to address reducing door-to-needle time in a non-PCI-capable hospital.What is consistent throughout these projects however, is the awareness that successfully implementing early reperfusion therapy is a challenging and complex task that requires a multi-faceted approach with consistent engagement from local stakeholders.

For patients presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital, timely delivery of fibrinolytic therapy relies on assessment of:
Time from onset of symptoms
ECG changes consistent with STEMI
Risk of complications related to STEMI
Risk of bleeding with fibrinolysis
Presence of shock or severe HF
Time required for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital

Unfortunately, 27% of patients in New Zealand who are eligible for reperfusion therapy fail to receive it.Therefore, reliable, timely delivery of thrombolysis demands greater awareness, faster recognition and more effective collaboration between clinicians and nurses involved in the initial assessment of STEMI patients. As a life threatening condition associated with time-dependent, therapy-related morbidity and mortality rates, quality care of STEMI patients is paramount. Due to our concerns regarding the assessment and management of STEMI patients previously identified, we were inspired to conduct a quality care review with the aim of highlighting the local STEMI protocol and the mechanisms for escalating care, to promote more timely management and positive patient outcomes.

### Acute coronary syndrome: current treatment [^24a02b31]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Family physicians need to identify and mitigate risk factors early, as well as recognize and respond to acute coronary syndrome events quickly in any clinical setting. Diagnosis can be made based on patient history, symptoms, electrocardiography findings, and cardiac biomarkers, which delineate between ST elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Rapid reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the goal with either clinical presentation. Coupled with appropriate medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention can improve short- and long-term outcomes following myocardial infarction. If percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed rapidly, patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction can be treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Fibrinolysis is not recommended in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome; therefore, these patients should be treated with medical management if they are at low risk of coronary events or if percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed. Post-myocardial infarction care should be closely coordinated with the patient's cardiologist and based on a comprehensive secondary prevention strategy to prevent recurrence, morbidity, and mortality.

### Improving STEMI management internationally: initial report of the American college of cardiology-global Heart attack treatment initiative [^1c44bbe9]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 20 million deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease occur every year worldwide, one-half due to coronary heart disease (CHD); of those, over 80% are estimated to take place in developing nations where most of the world population resides. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality as it is the predominant acute manifestation of CHD with a global prevalence of over 3 million cases a year.Recent reports show increasing rates of STEMI in countries like China and India, accounting for 60% to 80% of acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations.,,

This humanitarian and financial burden resulting from CHD, formerly considered a “first world” disease, is increasing due to a multiplicity of factors including the transformation of previously agricultural societies into urban industrialized cities with their ensuing unhealthy dietary habits, pollution, stress, and sedentary lifestyles. Other contributing issues such as relatively fast economic growth widening the gap between the rich and the poor; lack of CV risk factors and lifestyle modification initiatives; important educational challenges; and social and cultural disparities may also be present.

Meanwhile, significant improvements in STEMI care and outcomes have been achieved in countries with strong economies as the result of timely reperfusion, evidence-based pharmacological interventions, and implementation of quality improvement (QI) and system-based protocols. Initiatives such as the Mission: Lifeline and STEMI Accelerator Programs are largely responsible for many of these advancements in the United States, clinical registries such as the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry program and similar ones in Western Europe are key resources that provide ongoing measurement, track important processes, and identify opportunities for improvement.,,,,

Unfortunately, many countries lack such registries or systematic resources for data gathering on STEMI, a fact also present in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where some have even indicated they are virtually nonexistent. Surveys conducted by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have supported those considerations showing unacceptably low rates of reperfusion, widespread lack of local or national STEMI registries, and logistical limitations to adherence to ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines internationally.

Recognizing the significant global burden of STEMI and the paucity of data on system-based initiatives and performance metrics outside the United States and Western Europe, the ACC launched the Global Heart Attack Treatment Initiative (GHATI) primarily with the goal of collecting useful information in the understanding of how LMICs care for STEMI patients and their outcomes. With the ultimate aim of promoting the implementation of QI efforts, this initiative will enhance evidence-based CV care in LMICs and improve cardiovascular disease mortality worldwide.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes—translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels states that Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies); Level B recommendations may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies); and Level C recommendations are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, based on expert consensus, and when consensus recommendations are made, “consensus” is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. The recommendations and evidence synthesis were reviewed and revised by the Clinical Policies Committee, recommendations may be downgraded due to factors such as consistency of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude, and publication bias, and when possible clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios [LRs], number needed to treat) are presented to help apply results to the individual patient.

Acute coronary syndromes—ECG acquisition and serial testing guidance emphasizes that timely ECG acquisition is imperative with a goal to obtain and interpret an ECG by a trained clinician within 10 minutes of presentation; an initial nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG does not rule out or exclude ACS; nondiagnostic ECGs should be compared with prior tracings and a repeat ECG should be obtained during the emergency department course to assess for evolving changes; and registry data show that 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had an initial ECG that was nondiagnostic, with 72.4% of those having a follow-up ECG diagnostic of STEMI within 90 minutes, while ST-segment depression in V1–V3 could indicate evolving posterior STEMI.

### Thrombolysis in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^8d4e2666]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reperfusion therapy is essential for the management of acute coronary occlusion (ACO). In contemporary practice, however, this strategy is largely restricted to patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a paradigm shaped by the results of the fibrinolytic therapy trialists (FTT) collaborative study published over three decades ago. Thrombolysis, alongside percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), continues to play a significant role in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly in regions with limited access to PCI. In developing countries, thrombolysis is often the most accessible reperfusion strategy. A multinational survey of ACS management in these regions, including Latin America, found that among patients with STEMI, 39% did not receive any reperfusion therapy, while PCI and thrombolysis were used in similar proportions among those treated.ST-segment elevation (STE) is an imperfect surrogate for ACO, a substantial proportion of ACOs present without STE. Thus, some non-STE patients harbour ACO and could plausibly benefit from fibrinolysis. However, the current treatment paradigm does not explicitly consider the degree of coronary obstruction when guiding reperfusion strategies. Today, thrombolysis for STEMI is a class I indication in major guidelines worldwide. For cases without STE, this treatment is generally a class III recommendation, with the notable exceptions of right precordial ST depression (STD) suggestive of lateral wall (formerly ‘posterior’) infarction or diffuse STD with concurrent STE in lead aVR.The European Society of Cardiology guidelines mention patterns such as de Winter,Aslangerand Wellensas markers of possible ACO but remain ambiguous as to whether thrombolysis should be considered in these cases.

### Treatment of acute coronary syndrome: part 2: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^6b8049db]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Familiarize clinicians with recent information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of relevant medical literature.

Summary

Definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are reviewed.

Conclusions

Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction benefit from prompt reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive antianginal, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin agents minimize ongoing cardiac ischemia, prevent thrombus propagation, and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Reperfusion strategies in ST-elevation myocardial infarction – current status and perspectives for early and pre-hospital treatment [^88c49f14]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines on the emergency care of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction were published by the European Resuscitation Council at the end of 2005. Since then, numerous studies have been presented, which have led to important conclusions. Among pharmacological interventions, the opinion on adjuncts to anticoagulant treatment in the area of thrombolysis as well as in primary coronary intervention seems to be moving away from unfractionated heparin towards low molecular weight heparin, and possibly even factor Xa-specific pentasaccharide or the direct antithrombin bivalirudin. Clopidogrel has developed to become an accepted standard alongside aspirin in thrombolytic therapy of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, even if some questions still remain open. The promising idea of "facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention" has shown itself to at least be problematic if performed immediately and routinely after thrombolysis; "rescue" intervention in the event of ineffective thrombolysis is, on the other hand, useful and effective. Apparently, a more individualistic approach is required, which combines new therapeutic options and patients' conditions on the one side with regional resources on the other, to produce an optimal and timely strategy, remembering that one size does not fit all.

### Hospitals with and without percutaneous coronary intervention capability: considerations for treating acute coronary syndromes [^df1c4bd2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The crucial aim in the emergency management of patients presenting with chest pain is the identification of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the initiation of appropriate treatment. Institution-specific triage to initial medical or interventional therapies is influenced by the availability of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facilities. Although the use of invasive strategies has increased, most US hospitals do not have PCI facilities. Pharmacological management is an integral part of all treatment strategies, regardless of the availability of interventional capability. Given the growing importance of invasive management strategies, a therapy that is compatible with both medical and invasive therapy options is becoming increasingly important. Aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended for patients with ACS regardless of the conservative or invasive management strategy. With enoxaparin, patients with ACS can seamlessly transition from the medical management phase to the interventional management phase without the need for introducing a second anticoagulant in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Fondaparinux can be used for patients with ACS treated medically, but should not be used alone during PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis. Bivalirudin can be used in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who are managed invasively.

### Challenges in implementation of institutional protocols for patients with acute coronary syndrome [^3070a0af]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation ACS (non-STEMI and unstable angina). In recent years, there have been improvements in the rates of death, cardiogenic shock, and recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with ACS, primarily due to the introduction of new pharmacological and interventional therapies, as well as the introduction of and adherence to new treatment guidelines. However, ACS still represents a considerable public health burden. Treatment recommendations for STEMI and non-ST-segment elevation differ and there is wide variation in practice patterns and adherence among and within hospitals especially for the latter diagnosis. Adoption of institutional protocols may help decrease variability and improve quality of care, efficiency, and, ultimately, patient outcomes. This report discusses the process of developing and implementing institutional protocols for patients with ACS, from initial medical contact to discharge and beyond.

### Improving door-to-needle times for patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction at a rural district general hospital [^f673a3a4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Whilst working at a rural 131-bed district general hospital in New Zealand, we noted a high incidence of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) receiving thrombolytic therapy outside the recommended 30 minutes door-to-needle time. Although final treatment was often only 5-10 minutes outside guideline recommendations,we were concerned by the seemingly inconsistent management of these patients, often leading to unnecessary delays in the initiation of rapid reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, commencement of appropriate secondary prevention medications, to reduce the risk of further myocardial infarction (MI), was variable. As part of a global effort to reduce mortality from STEMI in smaller healthcare institutions, without a cardiac catheterization laboratory, New Zealand endorses several international guidelines for STEMI management, with expert-led biennial review.However, in our hospital there was no recently updated guideline to aid junior doctors in identifying, investigating and managing patients with STEMI and triggering a co-ordinated senior clinician response.

### Incidence, relevant patient factors, and clinical outcomes of the misdiagnosis of ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: results from the Korea acute myocardial infarction registry [^1b7cd088]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

In spite of considerable advances in cardiovascular care, there still have been largely missed opportunities in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.Rapid myocardial revascularization in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present within 48 hours of symptom onset is critical for increasing the chances and extent of myocardial salvage and better clinical outcomes.,The initial diagnosis of STEMI based on symptoms and signs, including an ECG, is critical to achieving timely myocardial revascularization.However, it was reported that ≈10% to 20% of patients with STEMI have no chest pain or atypical symptoms like dyspnea at presentation.Furthermore, there are variations in interpreting potential STEMI ECGs among physicians.In addition, diverse health care professionals, including primary care physicians, residents, emergency medical physicians, and cardiologists, alone or collaboratively, make the initial working diagnosis in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. Failure to timely diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including STEMI (missed diagnosis), is not rare and leads to delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment or failure of reperfusion therapy.However, there have been few investigations on why STEMI is not diagnosed timely and the clinical consequences of delayed diagnosis in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era. Understanding these issues may be helpful in optimizing care delivery and improving the clinical outcomes of STEMI.

In the present study, we sought to investigate the incidence, relevant patient factors, and clinical outcomes of the misdiagnosis of STEMI as non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from a nationwide, prospective Korean registry of AMI.

### Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: when is rapid revascularization critical? [^f21cab3e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

For example, in the TIMACS (Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial,3031 patients with AMI were randomized to coronary angiography ≤24 (median 14) hours versus ≥36 (median 50) hours. At 6 months, the primary outcome (death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia) occurred in 9.6% in the early and 11.3% in the delayed intervention group (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68–1.06; P =0.15). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, early intervention improved the primary outcome in the one third of study patients with a GRACE score ≥140 (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.89) but not in the two thirds with a GRACE score <140 (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.81–1.56; interaction P =0.01). As the overall trial was not positive, the benefit for patients with GRACE score ≥140 was considered hypothesis generating.
