## Question

can you order ionized clacium in the outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ionized calcium can be ordered in the outpatient setting and, if so, when it should be ordered versus when total calcium (with or without albumin adjustment) suffices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic rationale for measuring ionized calcium. Then, I should verify real-world outpatient ordering feasibility and patterns. Next, I will review guideline-based indications that specifically call for ionized calcium in ambulatory care. After that, I need to examine the limitations of albumin-adjusted calcium and when it misleads. Finally, I will synthesize practical outpatient scenarios and provide a concise recommendation anchored to evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic basis. Ionized calcium is the biologically active fraction, whereas total calcium includes protein-bound and complexed forms. Because albumin concentration and pH alter binding, total calcium may not reflect true calcium status, especially in hypoalbuminemia, critical illness, or kidney disease, which is why direct ionized calcium is considered the reference standard when accuracy matters [^111HSt13] [^1123x5mE].

> Wait, let me verify outpatient feasibility before jumping to indications. Large-scale observational data show that ionized calcium is indeed available and can be ordered in the outpatient setting, though it is ordered far less frequently than total calcium; in a population-based study of 4.3 million people, ionized calcium comprised 919,381 tests versus over 7 million total calcium tests, and only 4.4% of ionized calcium orders originated in outpatient settings compared with 94.7% in inpatient/ED, confirming feasibility but low outpatient utilization [^112qVjWc] [^115Y4M16].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing total calcium with ionized calcium everywhere. Contemporary guidance emphasizes that unadjusted total calcium remains the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings, with ionized calcium reserved for specific scenarios where accuracy changes management. This aligns with stewardship goals to avoid unnecessary testing and cost while maintaining diagnostic precision when it counts [^112uBifc] [^111zzLwQ].

> I need to check guideline-based outpatient indications that specifically call for ionized calcium. For suspected normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, both the Fifth International Workshop and the AAES recommend obtaining adjusted total calcium and, when normocalcemic PHPT is a consideration, measuring ionized calcium to improve diagnostic yield; this is a classic outpatient scenario where ionized calcium changes classification and downstream decisions [^113LrxeF]. In nephrolithiasis workups, the EAU recommends ionized calcium or total calcium plus albumin to characterize calcium metabolism, again supporting outpatient ionized calcium when stone risk stratification is needed [^115kdTLD]. For post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia risk and management, endocrine surgery guidance supports perioperative calcium-related testing including ionized calcium to guide safe discharge and supplementation, which often extends into outpatient follow-up [^117UM9aW].

> Let me consider the limitations of albumin-adjusted calcium, because that often drives the decision to order ionized calcium. Multiple large studies show that albumin-adjusted calcium correlates only modestly with ionized calcium and can misclassify hypo- and hypercalcemia, particularly in hypoalbuminemia; unadjusted total calcium actually performs as well or better than adjusted formulas in most settings, and relying on adjusted calcium risks underestimating hypocalcemia and overestimating hypercalcemia, which can lead to inappropriate treatment decisions [^112ZnHRU] [^115Y4M16] [^111HSt13]. In CKD and dialysis populations, both uncorrected and corrected total calcium poorly predict ionized calcium, reinforcing the need for direct ionized calcium when results will change therapy [^1123x5mE] [^114MVp4E].

> But wait, what if the patient is critically ill or has marked acid-base disturbances? I should double-check that point. Albumin-adjusted calcium is particularly unreliable in critical illness and should not be used to guide therapy; in those contexts, direct ionized calcium is preferred, though this is primarily an inpatient/ICU principle rather than a routine outpatient issue, it underscores why outpatient clinicians may still prefer ionized calcium when the clinical picture and albumin status raise concern for misclassification [^114tGh9Y] [^115YaZVo].

> Next, I should review practical outpatient scenarios where ionized calcium meaningfully changes care. Beyond normocalcemic PHPT and stone evaluation, ionized calcium is useful when total calcium and clinical symptoms or PTH are discordant, when albumin is low and adjusted calcium is suspect, in complex endocrine disorders where subtle calcium shifts matter, and in postoperative endocrine surgery follow-up when precise calcium assessment guides tapering of supplements. Conversely, routine screening or mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia evaluations can often start with total calcium plus PTH and vitamin D, escalating to ionized calcium only if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if results are discordant with the clinical picture [^113LrxeF] [^115kdTLD] [^117NS27X].

> I should confirm operational considerations. Ionized calcium is more expensive and may require special handling or specific analyzers, which partly explains its lower outpatient utilization. Nonetheless, most modern outpatient laboratories can accommodate it, albeit sometimes with longer turnaround or send-out delays, so clinicians should weigh timeliness and cost against diagnostic yield in each case [^112qVjWc] [^111zzLwQ].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is balanced. Yes, ionized calcium can be ordered in the outpatient setting and is appropriate when diagnostic accuracy is paramount, particularly for suspected normocalcemic PHPT, nephrolithiasis risk characterization, discordant calcium-PTH profiles, hypoalbuminemia where adjusted calcium is unreliable, and selected postoperative endocrine contexts. For most routine outpatient evaluations, total calcium with PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D remains the practical starting point, with ionized calcium added selectively when results will alter management or when adjusted calcium is likely to mislead [^113LrxeF] [^115kdTLD] [^112uBifc] [^111zzLwQ].

Yes, **ionized calcium can be ordered in the outpatient setting** when clinically indicated, such as for suspected normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, significant hypoalbuminemia, critical illness, or when total calcium and clinical findings are discordant [^113LrxeF] [^112uBifc]. It is **not routine** because of higher cost, limited availability, and the need for special handling; total calcium with albumin is usually sufficient, and albumin-adjusted calcium is often unreliable [^111zzLwQ] [^115Y4M16]. Order ionized calcium when results will change management, and coordinate with your lab for proper sample handling and timing [^112uBifc] [^113Lmnff].

## Clinical indications for ordering ionized calcium in outpatient settings

Ionized calcium testing is **indicated in specific outpatient scenarios**, including:

- **Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism**: Suspected when PTH is elevated despite normal total calcium; ionized calcium helps confirm true hypercalcemia [^113LrxeF] [^1126bGwH].

- **Significant hypoalbuminemia**: Total calcium may not reflect ionized calcium; direct measurement avoids misclassification [^111zzLwQ] [^1123x5mE].

- **Critical illness or acute settings**: Outpatient urgent care or ED may require ionized calcium for rapid, accurate assessment [^11658KtY] [^117SDSLN].

- **Discordant clinical findings**: When total calcium and symptoms/PTH disagree, ionized calcium clarifies true calcium status [^111zzLwQ] [^112ZnHRU].

---

## Limitations and challenges of ordering ionized calcium in outpatient settings

While ionized calcium is **clinically valuable**, several limitations affect its outpatient use:

- **Cost**: Higher than total calcium, limiting routine use [^111zzLwQ].

- **Availability**: Not all outpatient labs have ion-selective electrodes; may require send-outs, delaying results [^notfound].

- **Sample handling**: Requires strict anaerobic, heparinized samples; delays or exposure to air can alter results [^notfound].

- **Clinical guidelines**: Recommend total calcium with albumin for most cases; reserve ionized calcium for specific indications [^113LrxeF].

## Comparison with total calcium and albumin-adjusted calcium measurements

| **Measurement** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Total calcium | - Widely available <br/> - Lower cost <br/> - Routine outpatient use | - Influenced by albumin <br/> - May misclassify calcium status [^111zzLwQ] |
| Albumin-adjusted calcium | - Accounts for albumin <br/> - Simple calculation | - Poor correlation with ionized calcium <br/> - Risk of misclassification, especially in hypoalbuminemia [^111zzLwQ] [^115Y4M16] |
| Ionized calcium | - Direct measure of active calcium <br/> - Accurate in hypoalbuminemia and complex cases [^1123x5mE] [^117SDSLN] | - Higher cost <br/> - Limited availability <br/> - Strict sample handling [^113Lmnff] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **selective use** of ionized calcium in the outpatient setting:

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism**: Use ionized calcium when normocalcemic disease is suspected [^113LrxeF] [^114vqPTs].

- **General outpatient care**: Total calcium with albumin is sufficient; avoid routine ionized calcium [^112uBifc] [^111zzLwQ].

- **Critical illness or acute care**: Ionized calcium is preferred for rapid, accurate assessment [^112uBifc] [^117SDSLN].

---

## Practical considerations for ordering ionized calcium in outpatient settings

When ordering ionized calcium, **consider the following**:

- **Clinical justification**: Document the indication to support medical necessity and reimbursement [^112uBifc].

- **Laboratory coordination**: Confirm availability, handling requirements, and turnaround time with the lab [^112qVjWc].

- **Patient preparation**: Instruct on timing, fasting (if required), and sample handling to ensure accuracy [^113Lmnff].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ionized calcium can be ordered in the outpatient setting when clinically indicated, such as for normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, significant hypoalbuminemia, or discordant findings. It is **not routine** because of cost, availability, and handling requirements; total calcium with albumin suffices for most cases, and albumin-adjusted calcium is often unreliable. Use ionized calcium selectively, guided by clinical context and lab logistics.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^115Y4M16]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, we found that total calcium and serum albumin were commonly ordered together. In a population of 4.3 million people over approximately 7 years, there were more than 7 million measurements of total calcium, with approximately 4 million paired with serum albumin, suggesting a heavy reliance on albumin-adjusted calcium. Of concern, albumin-adjusted calcium only correlated modestly with ionized calcium and generally fared no better than (unadjusted) total calcium alone, but rather had the tendency to systematically underestimate true hypocalcemia, particularly in the presence of low serum albumin (ie, a scenario where adjustment formulas are likely to be relied on the most but paradoxically where they are least reliable). Therefore, the additional cost and inconvenience of manually calculating an albumin-adjusted calcium are difficult to justify, especially given the excess risk of misclassifying calcium status, which can lead to incorrect downstream treatment decisions. Instead, our findings suggested that total calcium alone was the best available alternative to directly measuring ionized calcium, against common practice.

1.1 Administration Instructions

Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.

The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient's fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.

Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.

1.2 Suggested Dosing

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.

Table 1: REGIOCIT Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood

Prior to initiating therapy, the patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician's prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.

Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.

### Absence of mutation in coding regions of CYP2R1 gene in apparent autosomal dominant vitamin D 25-hydroxylase deficiency rickets [^112grWYE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

This is a case report of a proband and his family presenting with apparent autosomal dominant 25-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency and bone disease.

Objective

The aim of the study was to present an alternative pattern of transmission of 25-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency other than autosomal recessive.

Design

We diagnosed our patient with 25-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency, treated him, and examined his DNA for mutations. Evaluations at other institutions, clinical history of all family members, and laboratory testing for the mother, aunt, and maternal grandmother were reviewed. Family consent was obtained for all testing and record review.

Setting

The patient was evaluated serially in an outpatient clinic. Routine laboratory studies for proband, mother, and maternal grandmother were obtained. Genetic testing was performed in another institution after obtaining family consent.

Interventions

No research intervention was performed.

Main Outcome Measures

Routine clinical care included an evaluation of growth pattern. Laboratory evaluation included 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], alkaline phosphatase, intact PTH, phosphate, calcium, ionized calcium, and magnesium levels.

Results

Results showed consistently low 25-hydroxylase enzyme function. They also showed elevated alkaline phosphatase and PTH, as well as decreased phosphate and calcium. These abnormalities were corrected with 1,25(OH)₂D therapy.

Conclusion

We conclude that 25-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This case raises a question about different tributary pathways affecting the function of the 25-hydroxylase enzyme. Physiological dosing of 1,25(OH)₂D was sufficient for treatment. There were no detectable mutations in any of the coding regions of the gene or its intronic junctions.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^112uBifc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In light of these factors, we suggest that unadjusted calcium remains the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Clinicians should be thoughtful about ordering ionized calcium instead of total calcium. Ionized calcium should be considered to inform on acute management of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, especially in the critically ill. It should also be considered in patients with preexisting calcium disorders (eg, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism) when the total calcium does not reflect a patient's symptoms or clinical status. This is particularly important in the current health care climate, where there is emphasis on the reduction of unnecessary testing.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in MEN1 — biochemical screening and diagnosis state that "Concomitant measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted serum calcium, and serum phosphorus is used to screen for PHPT". Diagnostic criteria note that "PHPT is diagnosed with the combination of hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal PTH; although normocalcemic PHPT may be noted with a persistently normal serum calcium combined with an elevated PTH without a secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism", and "An ionized calcium measurement may be considered, especially in normocalcemic PHPT".

KDOQI US commentary — calcium measurement approach and alkaline phosphatase use: The work group did not recommend that corrected calcium measurement be abandoned at present, although recent data did not show superiority over total calcium alone, and it considered measurement of ionized calcium to be more specific, but presently not practical or cost-effective. The KDOQI Work Group recommends using total alkaline phosphatase activity as an adjunct test, which may provide supplemental information in the assessment of bone turnover, particularly in the setting of increased PTH levels and in the assessment of response to therapy for increased PTH levels if liver disease is not likely to be the cause of increased total alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase derives more specifically from bone and can be used when the clinical situation is more ambiguous; however, the test is not readily available. High total alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality, but it is not known whether therapies aimed at decreasing these levels improve patient outcomes. The KDOQI bone guideline also discussed that concomitant consideration of alkaline phosphatase levels can increase the predictive power of PTH levels; data were insufficient to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase levels for renal osteodystrophy alone or together with PTH levels, and the value of alkaline phosphatase for clinical decision making remains to be proved.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^111zzLwQ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Calcium is a tightly regulated mineral that is essential to intracellular signaling, bone mineralization, coagulation, and neuromuscular function. Disorders of calcium metabolism can be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. As such, reliable calcium measurement, accurate classification of calcium status, and timely treatment of hypo- or hypercalcemia, when present, are important.

Approximately half of circulating calcium is bound to serum proteins, principally albumin, and the other half is ionized, but only the ionized fraction is biologically active. Even though ionized calcium is more physiologically relevant, total calcium is more commonly measured because of its greater accessibility and the lower costs for analysis. However, concern has been raised that reliance on total calcium alone may result in misclassification because changes in blood pH and serum protein concentrations can affect calcium-protein binding, and therefore alter the correlation between total calcium and ionized calcium.

For decades, adjustment of total calcium has been used clinically as an alternative to ionized calcium, with little empirical evidence to support the practice. Indeed, the original correction formula proposed by Payne and colleaguesin 1973 was derived from a single study of 200 patients using a historical laboratory method no longer available today, and never validated against ionized calcium. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that albumin-adjusted calcium correlates poorly with ionized calcium, especially in patients who are critically ill, those with kidney failure on dialysis, and in geriatric populations. Addressing this, some investigators have attempted to derive new formulas that correlate better with ionized calcium, but with many still concluding that unadjusted total calcium correlates best with ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Although global evidence suggests that most adjustment formulas are not clinically reliable, it is unclear how commonly they are used in practice. Moreover, the generalizability of current evidence remains limited, as prior studies were largely limited to highly selected populations, such as hospitalized patients. Additionally, most of the laboratory data were collected from a single laboratory usually affiliated with a tertiary center.

Addressing this, we conducted a large population-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the correlation between total calcium (with or without adjustment) vs ionized calcium (as a reference standard), to examine the potential association with disease classification (where misdiagnosis could lead to inappropriate downstream investigations and/or treatments), and to describe general calcium ordering patterns in clinical practice.

### When is it appropriate to order an ionized calcium? [^113Lmnff]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Convincing evidence demonstrates that ionized calcium and not total calcium is the physiologically relevant component of blood calcium. Direct measurement of ionized calcium, however, is limited by difficulties in accurate analysis, lack of standardization, and need for special handling, all resulting in increased cost; therefore, strategies have been developed to estimate ionized calcium from total calcium adjusted for levels of albumin, measurements that are more available and relatively inexpensive. This commentary compares the advantages and limitations of direct or calculated determinations of ionized calcium. Also examined are available data illustrating the settings in which measurement of ionized calcium is preferred and, in some cases, necessary for clinical decision-making.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcaemia or organ damage, but, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT. A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcaemic patients as in those with hypercalcaemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcaemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH as well as on self-reported symptoms, and this was regardless of whether patients were normocalcaemic or hypercalcaemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcaemic patients. Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and to those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered. In the final cohort of 23 patients, surprisingly few were overtly asymptomatic when evaluated with a simple questionnaire. Altogether, 19 patients reported malaise, weakness or reduced power of concentration. One patient suffered from nephrolithiasis and another patient reported osteoporosis.

We can only speculate on the consequences of the delay to potential treatment. However, it is reasonable to assume that a minor group of patients will deteriorate in their biochemical profile and would have benefitted from an early diagnosis, proper monitoring and treatment. For the majority of cases, reduced bone mineral density, the risk of cardiovascular disease and other symptoms of pHPT as, e.g. nephrocalcinosis, also could be assumed to worsen over time.

The reason why the calcium and PTH analyses were ordered was sparsely reported. However, calcium analysis is part of a routine package of analyses available to physicians and is frequently ordered when a screening of the patients' renal function and electrolyte levels is demanded. In most cases, an incidental finding of hypercalcemia seems to have been the reason for the analysis of PTH.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^114tGh9Y]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness but tends to normalize during the early days of admission to intensive care.

- In most cases normalization of calcium status is not associated with improved outcome, however mortality may be higher in severely hypocalcaemic patients who remain hypocalcemic on the fourth day of their admission.

- Calcium supplementation does not improve either calcium normalization or survival and a large randomized controlled trial is required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of this intervention.

- Albumin-adjusted calcium is a poor predictor of low ionized calcium in critical illness and should not be used in this setting.

- Low magnesium, sodium and albumin are independently associated with low ionized calcium and this should be considered in the overall management of each patient.

### Effect of ionized calcium level on short-term prognosis in severe multiple trauma patients: a clinical study [^113Vs32z]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The second limitation stems from the relatively long patient enrollment period of 6 years. Although the criteria for triggering MTP have not been revised during the period, indications for operation and IVR may have changed, and the techniques and outcomes of these interventions may have improved. However, the impact of such changes and improvements on 28-day mortality was not considered in the present study and warrants further investigation.

### The investigation of hypocalcaemia and rickets [^112wy7NJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Our understanding of disorders that present with hypocalcaemia has advanced rapidly in the past decade. The molecular basis of many of these disorders and conditions associated with phosphate wasting has now been established. While many children will need specialist involvement, they often will present to general paediatricians, and appropriate investigations prior to intervention will enable early diagnosis. Not all children with hypocalcaemia and low or low normal parathyroid hormone levels have isolated hypoparathyroidism, and clinicians need to be aware of the potential for misdiagnosis. Outpatient departments and paediatric wards should have a readily accessible and comprehensive list of bloods that need to be taken when a child presents with hypocalcaemia or rickets.

### Calcium management after thyroidectomy: a simple and cost-effective method [^111JnPEo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypocalcemia is one of the principal complications of total or completion thyroidectomy. A number of different protocols for managing this potential complication have been published. Our simple postoperative regimen is described and the safety and cost-effectiveness assessed.

Study Design

Case series with planned data collection.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Subjects and Methods

All patients undergoing total or completion thyroidectomy from January 2008 through June 2010 were evaluated. Data collected included age; gender; procedure performed; levels of ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D; complications; and need for readmission. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize these data.

Results

In total, 526 patients had thyroid surgery during the 30-month study period. Of these, 307 underwent completion or total thyroidectomy and were prescribed a 3-week tapering course of calcium carbonate postoperatively. Twenty-three patients (7.5%) experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia that were managed on an outpatient basis with additional doses of oral calcium. Two patients (0.7%) required readmission. The cost of a 3-week regimen of calcium carbonate is approximately $15. This is considerably less expensive than either the cost of overnight admission or published laboratory protocols that are designed to predict the risk of hypocalcemia.

Conclusions

Prophylactic calcium supplementation without routine laboratory assessment proved to be a safe and cost-effective method of preventing and managing postoperative hypocalcemia following total or completion thyroidectomy.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^114vqPTs]. Osteoporosis International (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism if serum calcium is elevated (total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium) in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the absence of conditions mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism (thiazide diuretics or lithium) and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^116D3Vxw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

CKD-MBD — dialysate calcium in CKD stage 5D — we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5–3.0 mEq/L (1.25–1.50 mmol/L) (2D). Studies that have measured calcium in spent dialysate have found near-neutral calcium flux in patients with a dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5 mEq/L, and the weak recommendation based on a majority vote of the work group suggests calcium dialysate concentration of 2.5–3.0 mEq/L (1.25–1.50 mmol/L) for both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Selecting dialysate calcium concentration requires consideration of the patient's calcium levels and other laboratory components of CKD-MBD; concomitant therapies with phosphate binders, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, or calcimimetics; and treatment goals, acknowledging that others have argued hemodialysate calcium concentration may need to be lower to achieve a neutral calcium mass balance and that a higher dialysate calcium concentration may be needed in patients on nocturnal hemodialysis therapy; thus, the US practitioner needs to use judgment, and in the absence of robust clinical data the practitioner in the outpatient dialysis setting also needs to weigh safety concerns in prescribing individualized dialysate calcium concentrations.

### Albumin-corrected or ionized calcium in renal failure? What to measure? [^114MVp4E]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidsm is frequently observed in patients with chronic renal failure, and clinical treatment guidelines have been published. Despite this, a large proportion of patients do not reach the target levels for calcium, phosphorus, calcium x phosphorus product, or intact parathyroid hormone. The use of albumin-corrected calcium is recommended as calcium measurement, but it is the concentration of ionized calcium that is biologically active. We hypothesized that in clinical practice, the use of ionized calcium rather than albumin-corrected calcium would influence the calcium classification of the individual patient.

Methods

Blood samples from 34 patients in chronic haemodialysis were analysed for evaluation of mineral metabolism according to K/DOQI guidelines. Blood for analysis of total and ionized calcium was drawn simultaneously. As ionized calcium is pH dependent, samples were analysed at the actual pH of the individual patient.

Results

For both methods, a similar number of patients were characterized as normocalcaemic. The use of albumin-corrected calcium caused one patient (3%) to be classified as hypocalcaemic, and 10 patients (26%) as hypercalcaemic whereas with ionized calcium, five (15%) and three patients (9%) were classified as hypo- and hypercalcaemic, respectively.

Conclusions

According to present guidelines, the difference in calcium classification of patients might have clinical implications for the prescription of vitamin D, and on the choice of phosphate binders.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels in thyroid and parathyroid surgery [^112qswdf]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement in predicting postoperative hypocalcemia after thyroid and parathyroid surgeries that places total parathyroid function at risk.

Study Design

Retrospective case review.

Methods

The case records of 23 patients undergoing total or completion thyroidectomy and 30 patients undergoing parathyroid exploration were reviewed. All patients had intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels measured. Samples were taken before dissection and 10 minutes after the resection was completed. Serial ionized calcium levels were measured in the postoperative period. Percentages of reduction in PTH levels from preoperative to postresection levels were calculated. Percentages of reduction in PTH level and the absolute value of the intraoperative PTH values were compared with postoperative ionized calcium levels.

Results

In the 23 patients who underwent thyroid surgery, the average preoperative and postoperative PTH values were 50 pg/mL (range, 17–87 pg/mL) and 34 pg/mL (range, 4–93 pg/mL), respectively. The average decrease in PTH was 39% (range, 39%-90%). The incidence of hypocalcemia was significantly higher in patients with intraoperative PTH levels less than 15 pg/mL relative to patients with PTH levels greater than 15 pg/mL in this setting (P = 0.006). In the 30 patients who underwent parathyroid exploration, average preoperative and postoperative PTH levels were 291 pg/mL (range, 65–1675 pg/mL) and 113.8 pg/mL (range, 6.5–1263 pg/mL) respectively. The intraoperative PTH level did not correlate with postoperative calcium levels in the parathyroid group. Percentages of decrease in PTH levels greater than 60% was statistically associated with surgical cure in this population.

Conclusions

The study demonstrates that intraoperative PTH levels greater than 15 pg/mL after total or completion thyroidectomy indicate a low risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and that these patients may be candidates for outpatient surgery. In the parathyroid group, intraoperative PTH levels do not correlate well with postoperative calcium levels.

### Ionized calcium concentration and outcome in critical illness [^1129Hott]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of abnormalities of ionized calcium levels with mortality in a heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients.

Design

Retrospective, combined clinical and biochemical study.

Setting

Four combined medical/surgical intensive care units.

Patients

Cohort of 7,024 adult critically ill patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We studied 177,578 ionized calcium measurements, from 7024 patients, with a mean value of 1.11 mmol/L (ionized calcium measured every 4.5 hrs on average). The unadjusted lowest and highest ionized calcium reported during intensive care unit stay were significantly different between intensive care unit survivors and nonsurvivors (p < .001). If hypocalcemia occurred at least once during the intensive care unit stay, the probability of intensive care unit mortality increased by 46%, 108%, and 150% for ionized calcium levels < 1.15, 0.90, and 0.80 mmol/L, respectively. If hypercalcemia occurred at least once during the intensive care unit stay, the probability of intensive care unit mortality increased by 100%, 162%, and 190% for ionized calcium levels > 1.25, 1.35, and 1.45 mmol/L, respectively. Similar trends were seen for hospital mortality. However, from multivariate logistic regression analysis, only an ionized calcium < 0.8 mmol/L or an ionized calcium > 1.4 mmol/L were independently associated with intensive care unit and hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Within a broad range of values, ionized calcium concentration has no independent association with hospital or intensive care unit mortality. Only extreme abnormalities of ionized calcium concentrations are independent predictors of mortality.

### Evaluation of a calcium, magnesium and phosphate clinical ordering tool in the emergency department [^117Y4RKT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We developed a clinical tool comprising patient risk factors for having an abnormal calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) or phosphate (PO₄) level. We hypothesized that patients without a risk factor do not require testing. This study examined the tool's potential utility for rationalizing Ca, Mg and PO₄ ordering in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We undertook a retrospective observational study in a single metropolitan ED. Patients aged 18 years or more who presented between July and December 2019 were included if they had a Ca, Mg or PO₄ test during their ED stay. Demographic and clinical data, including the presence of risk factors, were extracted from the medical record. The primary outcome was a clinically significant abnormal Ca, Mg or PO₄ level (> 0.2 mmol/l above or below the laboratory reference range).

Results

Calcium, Mg and PO₄ levels were measured on 1426, 1296 and 1099 patients, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios of the tool identifying a patient with a Ca level > 0.2 mmol/l outside the range were 0.05, 0.99, 1.59 and 0.41, respectively. The values for Mg were 0.02, 1.00, 1.44 and 0.35 and those for PO₄ were 0.15, 0.93, 1.38 and 0.57, respectively. The majority of patients not identified as having an abnormal level did not receive electrolyte correction treatment. Application of the tool would have resulted in a 35.8% cost reduction.

Conclusion

The tool failed to predict a very small proportion of patients (approximately 1%) with an abnormal Ca or Mg level and for whom it would have been desirable to have these levels measured. It may help rationalize Ca and Mg ordering and reduce laboratory costs.

Fig. 3
A total of 82 patients with plausible pHPT were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded stepwise after answering a survey and based on results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon

A second sampling of serum PTH, ionized calcium and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in a low-range hypercalcaemia as compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria, and the limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (ref 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study. Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and had to be excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study. The remaining 30 patients were assessed by one of two experienced endocrine surgeons focussing biochemistry, differential diagnoses and symptoms. Patients on medications able to influence serum calcium and PTH (thiazides n = 3, calcium n = 2), with previously known pHPT (n = 1) and a differential diagnosis (n = 1, sarcoidosis), were excluded.

After completing the survey, new blood tests and assessment by an endocrine surgeon (Fig. 2), 23 patients remained in the cohort, with a persistent biochemical pHPT and lack of known differential diagnoses. Table 4 presents laboratory values from these patients' new blood tests.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^112dUjup]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date assessing the epidemiology of calcium measurements and its correlation with ionized calcium as the reference standard. We also assessed laboratory ordering patterns, rarely reported in previous studies. Our data are based on a large population with comprehensive capture of all clinical encounters using high-quality linked health administrative and laboratory databases. All laboratory measurements were performed as part of routine clinical care, reducing the risk of selection bias. In comparison to previous studies, which have mostly been conducted at a single tertiary institution with a centralized laboratory, the present study included multiple sites (inpatient and outpatient, urban and rural, academic and community) with variety of laboratory platforms, which increases the generalizability of the findings.

Despite these strengths, our study was also subject to limitations. First, missing data could have affected our results. However, only 4000 records from approximately 7.7 million total calcium tests (0.05%) were excluded due to missing results. As such, the overall effect of missing data on our final conclusions is likely negligible. Second, the laboratory measurements were not performed in a centralized laboratory according to stringent research standards, but rather as part of routine clinical care across multiple platforms. Consequently, total calcium, ionized calcium, albumin, pH, and creatinine were measured using a variety of possible instruments and techniques. Even so, our pragmatic analysis can be construed as a strength because it provides data that reflect practice patterns not otherwise captured by highly selective single-center studies. With regard to measurement error, all tests were conducted using calibrated instruments meeting laboratory clinical standards. Third, we did not examine subgroups according to the presence of acid-base status, age, or kidney function because our overarching goal was to assess a large population with results that would be applicable in most clinical settings. However, numerous previous studies have already consistently shown a poor correlation between adjusted-calcium and ionized calcium in these settings. Additionally, we were not able to prove the intent of the clinicians who ordered the tests. We inferred that concurrent total calcium and serum albumin were likely used to calculate an albumin-adjusted calcium, but we acknowledge that there may have been other reasons that a serum albumin could have been requested. However, clinical indications for measuring serum albumin are few, so it is implausible that many of these albumin measurements were ordered for a different purpose.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^111J7Wzy]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Calcium and endocrine monitoring with asfotase alfa — management guidance states that calcium restriction is often recommended in infants/children with HPP to manage hypercalcemia; once treatment with asfotase alfa has been initiated, restrictions may be lifted and supplementation with additional calcium may be required to maintain PTH within the normal range. Accordingly, serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH levels should be monitored very closely after initiating asfotase alfa, and in perinatal and infantile patients, ionized calcium should be measured; if ionized calcium testing is not available, albumin levels are needed to interpret calcium findings.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^115a2UJm]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary. A waiver of consent was granted for access to personal identifiable health information consistent with the conditions of section 50 of the Health Information Act of Alberta, Canada. Our study was reported according to the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely-Collected Data (RECORD) guideline.

Data Sources

We assembled a retrospective, population-based cohort of all adults (≥ 18 years of age) in the province of Alberta, Canada. Data were obtained from linked administrative databases of Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health, where universal health coverage is provided to 99% of the approximately 4.3 million people. These databases included population registries with details related to patient demographics, the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System/Ambulatory Care Classification System (NACRS/ACCS), Practitioner Claims (CLM), and laboratory services. These data have been used in numerous studies and are considered to be high quality and comprehensive.

Study Population

We identified adults (≥ 18 years of age) who were tested simultaneously (ie, same date and time) for serum total calcium and ionized calcium between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2019. Records were excluded if there was an invalid or missing patient identifier and/or test result (Figure 1). Baseline age and sex were retrieved from the health insurance registry. Results were stratified according to the collection location (inpatient/emergency department [ED] vs outpatient). Laboratory information systems were used to retrieve measurements of total calcium and ionized calcium for all patients; when available, serum albumin, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and blood pH were also obtained. Prior comorbidities (congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, cancer [single site or metastatic]) were identified with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes based on previously validated definitions. These records were linked per patient prior to their index calcium tests and went as far back as April 1, 2002.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^115sC4Yo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Laboratory Monitoring

Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.

Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio > 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio > 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:

A rapid decline in systemic iCa concentration despite adequate calcium compensation
A rapid decrease in pH or a decrease in base excess
A rapid increase in anion gap

In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of < 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.

### Current practices in monitoring children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia: a global survey of expert experience [^112N6D3k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemical assessment

At each clinic visit on conventional therapy, biochemical assessment begins with a measure of serum phosphorus. Ideally, this can be timed to capture the peak (about 1 hour after the morning oral doses of phosphate and calcitriol) or trough (about 4–6 hours after oral dosing) in a consistent manner. During the growth period, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is useful to monitor as an index of rickets severity. While a high ALP may reflect insufficient dosing of phosphate and calcitriol, it may also reflect a failure of such therapy, given that higher doses might increase the risk of other complications. It is important to ensure that age-appropriate ALP reference ranges are utilized in the interpretation of results due to the physiological variations in ALP levels during the different phases of growth. Excess phosphate or inadequate calcitriol may induce secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is best evaluated by assay of intact PTH and ionized or total serum calcium adjusted for albumin at each visit. Excess calcitriol dosing is initially reflected by increased urinary calcium excretion (as assessed by either a 24-hour urine or spot calcium/creatinine ratio). With persistent excess dosing or if administered in the presence of parathyroid autonomy, calcitriol may contribute to hypercalcemia. Measurements of FGF23, tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption adjusted for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D are not helpful for adjusting conventional therapy at clinic visits.

On burosumab treatment, similar biochemical parameters are measured, but timing of the blood and urine sampling is more flexible and is preferably completed just prior to dosing (trough), and peak values can be obtained day 7 to 11 after dosing. As standard FGF23 ELISA assays cannot measure endogenous hormone in the presence of burosumab (exogenous antibody), FGF23 measurement during burosumab therapy is not useful.

### Pitfalls of measuring total blood calcium in patients with CKD [^1123x5mE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Disorders of mineral and bone metabolism are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The recent National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines recommend that blood calcium (Ca) be regularly measured in patients with stages 3 to 5 CKD. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) position states that the measurement of ionized Ca (iCa) is preferred and that if total Ca (tCa) concentration is used instead, then it should be adjusted in the setting of hypoalbuminemia. In 691 consecutive patients with stages 3 to 5 CKD, we compared the ability of noncorrected and albumin-corrected tCa concentration to identify low, normal, or high iCa concentration. The agreement between noncorrected or albumin-corrected tCa and iCa was only fair. The risk for underestimating ionized calcium was independently increased by a low total CO₂ concentration when either noncorrected or albumin-corrected Ca was used and by a low albumin concentration only when noncorrected tCa was used. The risk for overestimating iCa was increased by a low albumin concentration only when albumin-corrected Ca was used. In conclusion, albumin-corrected tCa does not predict iCa better than noncorrected tCa. Moreover, both noncorrected and albumin-corrected tCa concentrations poorly predict hypo- or hypercalcemia in patients with CKD.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^116b66Kf]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our study is consistent with and extends the findings of previous reports. For decades, adjustment of total calcium has been entrenched in clinical practice to account for states of altered protein-binding, as an alternative to ionized calcium. However, these adjustment formulas have been repeatedly shown to be unreliable. As previously mentioned, the original correction formula proposed by Payne and colleagues was derived from a single laboratory using an albumin measurement method no longer available today, and never validated against ionized calcium. A modification was subsequently published in 1977, as a practical simplification, but not derived or validated in any patient cohort either. These correction formulas assumed that binding between calcium and albumin remained constant; but in reality, the calcium-albumin binding ratio has been shown to increase with hypoalbuminemia. As such, albumin-adjusted calcium has proven to be insensitive to hypocalcemia in hypoalbuminemic states. Moreover, the accuracy of albumin measurement itself is reduced in the setting of kidney failure. Acknowledging these limitations, new formulas have been proposed (mostly accounting for differences in calcium-albumin binding and kidney function), but for the most part, none of these have significantly improved upon using total calcium alone. Of note, one of the best-performing correction formulas was proposed by Pekar and colleagues, designed to directly estimate ionized calcium, and this showed marginal improvement in the overall correlation between the estimated and actual ionized calcium (R², 74.1%) compared with using total calcium alone (R², 71.7%), but the formula requires 4 laboratory measurements (ie, total calcium, albumin, creatinine, and pH) rather than 1, and is therefore more costly and cumbersome to implement than simply measuring ionized calcium itself (ie, measurement of blood pH would require an analyzer that already directly measures ionized calcium). Finally, it appears that locally derived formulas may offer incremental improvement in accuracy. For instance, the formula proposed by James and colleagueswas derived in the Calgary Health Region and performed the best in our study. However, the modest improvement in correlation shown in this study is unlikely to outweigh the complexity required to routinely implement this labor-intensive strategy of local derivation and validation in other jurisdictions.

### Use of a computerized order set to increase prescription of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients receiving glucocorticoids [^113gbgUC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend that patients taking glucocorticoids also take calcium and vitamin D supplements, regardless of the dose or intended duration of glucocorticoid use, to decrease their risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia or osteoporosis (GIOP).

Objective

To increase the number of prescriptions made for calcium and vitamin D in patients who receive a prescription for glucocorticoids using an automated, computerized order set.

Design

Pre-post test design.

Patients

A total of 1,041 outpatients receiving care at a single VA medical center. INTERVENTION/MAIN MEASURES: We developed an automated order set in which calcium and vitamin D were automatically co-ordered with glucocorticoid prescriptions of at least 2-week duration. We tested the impact of the order set by comparing the number of calcium and vitamin D prescriptions in patients taking glucocorticoids during a 12-month period before (T1) and after (T2) implementation. The automated order set could be modified by the treating physician, and it was not generated for patients with hypercalcemia.

Key Results

A total of 535 patients during T1 and 506 patients during T2 had a glucocorticoid prescription of at least 2-week duration. The percent of co-prescriptions for calcium increased from 37 to 49% and vitamin D from 38 to 53% (both p < 0.0001) after the new automated order set was implemented.

Conclusions

Implementation of an automatic prescription for calcium and vitamin D supplementation modestly increases the number of patients on glucocorticoids who are prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

### Targeted reduction in neurosurgical laboratory utilization: resident-led effort at a single academic institution [^115B1mQm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Given economic limitations and burgeoning health care costs, there is a need to minimize unnecessary diagnostic laboratory tests.

Methods

The authors studied whether a financial incentive program for trainees could lead to fewer unnecessary laboratory tests in neurosurgical patients in a large, 600-bed academic hospital setting. The authors identified 5 laboratory tests that ranked in the top 13 of the most frequently ordered during the 2010–2011 fiscal year, yet were least likely to be abnormal or influence patient management.

Results

In a single year of study, there was a 47% reduction in testing of serum total calcium, ionized calcium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphorus. This reduction led to a savings of $1.7 million in billable charges to health care payers and $75,000 of direct costs to the medical center. In addition, there were no significant negative changes in the quality of care delivered, as recorded in a number of metrics, showing that this cost savings did not negatively impact patient care.

Conclusions

Engaging physician trainees in quality improvement can be successfully achieved by financial incentives. Through the resident-led quality improvement incentive program, neurosurgical trainees successfully reduced unnecessary laboratory tests, resulting in significant cost savings to both the medical center and the health care system. Similar programs that engage trainees could improve the value of care being provided at other academic medical centers.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^116V5jcV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Correlation Between Total Calcium, Adjusted Calcium, and Ionized Calcium

We examined 10 adjustment formulas (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) that have been proposed for clinical practice, including the commonly used simplified Payne formula: adjusted calcium (mmol/L) = total calcium (mmol/L) + 0.02 [40 − albumin (g/L)]. Formulas were converted, if necessary, to SI units for standardization. All of the formulas that were examined were originally developed to adjust for total calcium (ie, by accounting for differences in protein binding), except for those developed by Pekarand Antonio, which were designed to directly estimate ionized calcium. To assess the association with albumin status, we performed a subanalysis in patients with low serum albumin (< 30 g/L) vs normal serum albumin (30–50 g/L). We conducted a Bland-Altman analysis and applied a linear transformation to standardize total calcium and ionized calcium onto the same scale (using a scaling factor [m] of [2.60 − 2.10]/[1.35 − 1.15] = 2.5 and an offset [b] of 2.10 − [2.5 × 1.15] = −0.775).

Frequency of Laboratory Measurements

To assess physician ordering patterns, we determined the frequency that serum calcium, ionized calcium, and serum albumin were measured simultaneously (collected at the same date and time). We described variations in these ordering patterns based on individual-level (eg, age, sex, and kidney function) and system-level characteristics (eg, clinical setting) over time.

### Factors affecting the relationship between ionized and corrected calcium levels in peritoneal dialysis patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^113HmQ4P]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Patient data were obtained from April 2017 to August 2018. All blood samples, including those for blood gas analysis, were collected from the vein during regular outpatient visits. Samples were transported to the laboratory and analyzed immediately after collection. Serum iCa levels and pH were analyzed using the ABL 800 system (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) with an ion-selective electrode and pH electrode, respectively. Serum iPTH levels were assessed using the COBAS8000 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) via electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Serum total Ca levels were measured using the TBA-2000 (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) with chlorophosphonazo III. Other biochemical parameters, including values of hemoglobin, creatinine, albumin, phosphorus, and C-reactive protein, were measured by standard laboratory techniques. We measured 24-h urine volume and examined weekly renal Kt/V, which were used as surrogate markers for RRF in this study, every 6 months as a periodical test. Blood and urine samples were collected and all biochemical parameters were measured simultaneously. Patients' clinical information, including sex, age, PD duration, body mass index (BMI), underlying disease, comorbidity, PD prescription, and medication, were also obtained during regular outpatient visits by reviewing their medical records.

Weekly renal Kt/V was calculated using the formula recommended by the Japanese Guidelines for Peritoneal Dialysis, which uses Watson's body fluid volume calculation.

Weekly renal Kt/V = {[urine urea nitrogen (mg/dL) × urine volume (mL/day)]/[serum urea nitrogen (mg/dL) × body fluid volume (L)]} × 7/1000.

Body fluid volume for males (mL) = 107.4 × height (cm) + 336.2 × BW (kg) + 2447–95.16 × age.

Body fluid volume for females (mL) = 106.9 × height (cm) + 246.6 × BW (kg) − 2097.

Albumin-corrected Ca levels were estimated using the Payne's formula recommended in the Japanese Guidelines for CKD-MBD: cCa = total serum Ca + [4 − serum Alb (g/dL)]. Serum albumin levels of ≥ 4.0 g/dL indicate that cCa level is equal to the total serum Ca level.

### Citrate for long-term hemodialysis: prospective study of 1, 009 consecutive high-flux treatments in 59 patients [^111St29C]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Regional citrate anticoagulation during hemodialysis is performed in selected patients at highly specialized units. We postulated that routine use of citrate at a long-term dialysis ward is safe and efficient.

Methods

During a 2-year period, we studied 1,009 consecutive citrate-anticoagulated high-flux hemodialysis treatments performed in 59 patients at our long-term dialysis ward. We used a simple citrate infusion protocol, calcium-free dialysate, and intravenous calcium substitution. Simple and clear algorithms allowed adjustments of the calcium substitution rate and dialysate settings by the attending nurse. Adverse events; indications for citrate anticoagulation; clotting; technical data; blood ionized calcium, sodium, and potassium levels; and acid-base homeostasis were analyzed prospectively.

Results

Of the treatments, 99.6% were accomplished successfully. Two adverse events were attributed to citrate use. Overall, ionized calcium levels were stable during the procedures and electrolyte and acid-base balances were well controlled. The use of central venous catheters for dialysis was associated with paradoxical behavior of ionized calcium levels (increasing blood ionized calcium levels despite decreased calcium infusion). Anticoagulation was excellent.

Conclusion

Routine use of citrate anticoagulation in the setting of a long-term hemodialysis ward is safe and efficient. Measured ionized calcium levels should be interpreted with care if central venous catheters are used for vascular access because they could be biased by recirculation.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^112Yiz5z]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

Methods

The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, after new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

Results

Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

Conclusion

Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to current research.

### The importance of measuring ionized calcium in characterizing calcium status and diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism [^1126bGwH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Serum total calcium (tCa) is routinely measured for diagnosing calcium disorders but may not reflect levels of biologically active ionized calcium (iCa) in disease or detect all cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Objective

We investigated the utility of measuring iCa and tCa for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism.

Design

This was an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study.

Patients

We studied a biochemistry cohort of consecutive ambulatory outpatients with suspected bone or calcium metabolism disorders referred for calcium metabolism biochemistry panels and a surgical cohort of consecutive tertiary hospital patients whose parathyroid specimens were submitted to a single center, and consecutive parathyroidectomy patients of a single surgeon with specimens submitted to a different center.

Results

In 5490 biochemistry cohort patients, discordance between iCa and tCa in classifying calcium status occurred in 12.6% of cases overall but was worse in hypercalcemic (whether defined by tCa and/or iCa) cases (49%) and hypocalcemic cases (92%). Reliance on tCa alone would miss 45% with ionized hypercalcemia. In 315 biochemistry cohort cases with PTH-dependent hypercalcemia, 130 (41%) had isolated ionized hypercalcemia at diagnosis. In 143 patients with histologically proven parathyroid disease, 24% had isolated ionized hypercalcemia at diagnosis. These patients were younger (P = 0.022) with milder ionized hypercalcemia and better renal function (both P ≤ 0.001) than patients presenting with concurrently elevated iCa and tCa.

Conclusion

In abnormal calcium states, tCa frequently disagrees with iCa in classifying calcium status. Histologically proven parathyroid disease can present with isolated ionized hypercalcemia. Measurement of iCa is required to accurately assess calcium status and improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Calcium and phosphate disorders: core curriculum 2024 [^113goT4d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Maintaining normal calcium and phosphate homeostasis is essential for optimal cellular, metabolic, and organ function. Parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis via multiple interlinked feedback loops, receptors, ion channels, and transporters. Following an initial overview of the stimuli and effects of the different hormonal regulators, this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology reviews the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate disorders through the lens of a series of illustrative cases. The cases span clinical conundrums commonly encountered by nephrologists in their daily clinical practice and other less common disorders. Some of the cases present in the outpatient clinic setting and others in the inpatient hospital setting. Patients with normal kidney function, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and acute kidney injury are all represented. Some of the disorders are iatrogenic, and some are due to native disease. All demonstrate key aspects of pathophysiology that are essential knowledge for nephrology clinicians of all career stages.

### Outpatient management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117X9ag9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in an outpatient setting. Most patients are asymptomatic with mild hypercalcemia and only require periodic follow-up. Symptomatic patients and those with end-organ damage should undergo surgery according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. No medical therapy has been approved for treatment of this disorder. Treatment with bisphosphonate, calcimimetic drugs, or alcohol ablation techniques has been used in select patients.

### Hidden hypercalcemia and mortality risk in incident hemodialysis patients [^113s6kWk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Neither uncorrected- nor albumin-corrected total calcium reliably predict ionized calcium in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, little is known about the consequences of inaccurate assessment of calcium concentration using total calcium.

Objective

We hypothesized that hidden hypercalcemia (ie, elevated ionized calcium with normal total calcium) and apparent hypercalcemia (ie, elevated ionized calcium with elevated total calcium) are both associated with increased mortality risk.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We identified 874 incident hemodialysis patients with measured serum ionized calcium, total calcium, albumin, phosphorus, and bicarbonate from October 2007 to December 2011, using data from a large dialysis organization in the United States.

Exposures

Serum concentrations of ionized calcium and total calcium were measured.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Results

There was only fair interindex agreement with calcium status between ionized calcium and uncorrected or corrected total calcium (κ = 0.32 and 0.27, respectively). Among patients with high ionized calcium (> 1.32 mmol/liter), 88% and 70% patients were incorrectly categorized as being normocalcemic using uncorrected and corrected total calcium, respectively, and were thus considered to have "hidden hypercalcemia". Compared to patients with low-normal ionized calcium (1.16–1.24 mmol/liter), patients with high ionized calcium had a significantly higher mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.75). Furthermore, compared to patients with normocalcemia (ionized calcium 1.16–1.32 mmol/liter), those with hidden hypercalcemia by uncorrected and corrected total calcium also had a higher risk for death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.75 [95% confidence interval 1.11–2.75] and 1.80 [95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.90], respectively).

Conclusion

The majority of end-stage renal disease patients with elevated ionized calcium are incorrectly categorized as normocalcemic using conventional total calcium measurements; these patients have a higher death risk. Future research is needed to establish whether reducing ionized calcium concentrations in these patients improves clinical outcomes.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^112ZnHRU]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Using albumin-adjusted calcium is commonly recommended for for measuring calcium, but with little empirical evidence to support the practice.

Objective

To assess the correlation between total calcium measurements (with or without adjustment) vs the ionized calcium level as a reference standard.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a population-based cross-sectional study in the province of Alberta, Canada, including adults tested for serum total calcium and ionized calcium simultaneously between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from March 2023 to October 2024.

Main Measures and Outcomes

The correlation between unadjusted and adjusted total calcium measurements (using 10 formulas) and the ionized calcium level was evaluated, along with the potential association with the classification of calcium status.

Results

Among 22 658 patients included, 11 889 (52.5%) were female and 10 769 (47.5%) were male; the median (IQR) age was 60 (47–72) years. The unadjusted total calcium (R² = 71.7%; 95% CI, 71.1%-72.2%) had a stronger correlation with ionized calcium than the commonly used simplified Payne formula (ie, total calcium [mmol/L]+0.02 [40-albumin (g/L)]) (R² = 68.9%; 95% CI, 68.0%-69.6%) and correlated similarly to other formulas (Payne: lowest R² = 60.3%; 95% CI, 59.3%-61.3%; and James: highest R² = 76.7%; 95% CI, 76.1%-77.3%). When classifying patients into categories of hypocalcemia, normocalcemia, or hypercalcemia, unadjusted total calcium had the best overall agreement (74.5%) with ionized calcium compared with albumin-adjusted calcium using the original Payne and simplified Payne formulas (agreement 63.0% and 58.7%, respectively). Misclassification using the adjustment formulas was worse in the presence of hypoalbuminemia (albumin level < 30 g/L).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study drawn from a contemporaneous population, there appeared to be heavy reliance on adjustment formulas for calcium in clinical practice with little gain but considerable risk of misclassification of true calcium status, especially in the presence of hypoalbuminemia. These results suggest that unadjusted total calcium was the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium.

### Improving serum calcium test ordering according to a decision algorithm [^112yr9ar]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To detect differences in the pattern of serum calcium tests ordering before and after the implementation of a decision algorithm.

Methods

We studied patients admitted to an internal medicine ward of a university hospital on April 2013 and April 2016. Patients were classified as critical or non-critical on the day when each test was performed. Adequacy of ordering was defined according to adherence to a decision algorithm implemented in 2014.

Results

Total and ionised calcium tests per patient-day of hospitalisation significantly decreased after the algorithm implementation; and duplication of tests (total and ionised calcium measured in the same blood sample) was reduced by 49%. Overall adequacy of ionised calcium determinations increased by 23% (P = 0.0001) due to the increase in the adequacy of ionised calcium ordering in non-critical conditions.

Conclusions

A decision algorithm can be a useful educational tool to improve adequacy of the process of ordering serum calcium tests.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^111P3m1p]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic hypoparathyroidism

Key elements for defining symptomatic hypoparathyroidism are: patient-reported symptoms, for example paraesthesia, muscle cramps, tetany, anxiety, and cognitive disturbances; and clinician-reported symptoms, for example Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. It should be specified whether symptoms were collected via structured questionnaires, clinical interviews, or electronic health records. In addition, timing should be clarified (immediate postoperative interval versus long-term follow-up). Commonly accepted indicators of severity are: need for intravenous calcium — a direct marker of acute symptomatic hypocalcaemia; emergency department visits, which reflect uncontrolled symptoms or complications; and hospital readmissions, which indicate persistent or recurrent hypocalcaemia requiring inpatient care. These variables are essential not only for prevalence estimates but also for evaluating the burden of disease and effectiveness of interventions.

Statement 15: To define prevalence of symptomatic hypoparathyroidism description of symptoms and how symptoms/signs were assessed and documented (patient-reported symptoms versus clinician-reported signs) should be specified. In particular, the need for intravenous calcium, visit(s) to the emergency department, and readmission(s) for hypoparathyroidism should be reported.

Consensus: Yes (8.179)

Outliers: 5

Negative outliers: 1

Evidence level: Moderate

Statement 16: Long-term follow-up data necessary for assessing prevalence of permanent hypoparathyroidism should include serum calcium (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) and PTH levels at 12 months after surgery, and information if an attempt was undertaken at stopping supplements within 12 months after surgery with failure to stay off supplements due to low calcium and/or reoccurring symptoms.

Consensus: Yes (8.146)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 4

Evidence level: Moderate

Statement 17: Pathology data should be reported with number (full/partial) of parathyroids identified in specimen.

Consensus: Yes (7.876)

Outliers: 6

Negative outliers: 3

Evidence level: Moderate

Baseline PTH serum level

Baseline PTH levels reflect the functional reserve of the parathyroid glands before surgery. Patients with a low preoperative PTH level may have subclinical parathyroid dysfunction or autoimmune thyroid disease (for example Hashimoto's thyroiditis), making them more vulnerable to postoperative hypocalcaemia. Some studies suggest that preoperative PTH levels positively correlate with the postoperative PTH decline rate, suggesting a predictive value for transient hypoparathyroidism.

### Postoperative calcium requirements in 6, 000 patients undergoing outpatient parathyroidectomy: easily avoiding symptomatic hypocalcemia [^116Ncup6]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the amount and duration of supplemental oral calcium for patients with varying clinical presentations discharged immediately after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

Study Design

A 4-year, prospective, single-institution study of 6,000 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism and discharged within 2.5 hours. Based on our previous studies, patients are started on a sliding scale of oral calcium determined by a number of preoperative measures (ie, serum calcium, body weight, osteoporosis) beginning 3 hours postoperation and decreasing to a maintenance dose by week 3. Patients reported all hypocalcemia symptoms daily for 2 weeks.

Results

Seven parameters were found to have a substantial impact on the amount of calcium required to prevent symptomatic hypocalcemia: preoperative serum calcium > 12 mg/dL, > 13 mg/dL, and > 13.5 mg/dL, bone density T score less than -3, morbid obesity, removal of > 1 parathyroid, and manipulation/biopsy of all remaining glands (all p < 0.05). Each independent variable increased the daily calcium required by 315 mg/day. Using our scaled protocol, < 8% of patients showed symptoms of hypocalcemia, nearly all of whom were successfully self-treated with additional oral calcium. Only 6 patients (0.1%) required a visit to the emergency room for IV calcium, all occurring on postoperative day 3 or later.

Conclusion

After outpatient parathyroidectomy, a specific calcium protocol has been verified that eliminates development of symptomatic hypocalcemia in > 92% of patients, identifies patients at high risk for hypocalcemia, and allows self-medication with confidence in a predictable fashion for those patients in whom symptoms develop.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^1175DUnU]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — initial evaluation focuses on confirming true hypocalcemia and assessing symptoms; calcium is bound heavily to albumin and hypoalbuminic states can cause hypocalcemia with ionized calcium levels maintained and the child asymptomatic, and if the child is having seizures or spasms due to hypocalcemia then intravenous calcium therapy is indicated; if symptomatic, the child needs to be admitted and started on intravenous calcium therapy, which is very irritating to the veins, and preferably therapy should be given using a central line.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^11658KtY]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — suggested diagnostic work-up emphasizes urgent, parallel evaluation. The steps included in the diagnostic work-up should be completed as soon as possible and occur simultaneously and in parallel with treatment. For all patients, obtain fingerstick glucose, monitor vital signs, perform head computed tomography (CT) scan (appropriate for most cases), order laboratory test: blood glucose, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, AED levels, and initiate continuous electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring. Based on clinical presentation, consider brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture (LP), a comprehensive toxicology panel including toxins that frequently cause seizures (i.e. isoniazid, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, cocaine, sympathomimetics, alcohol, organophosphates, and cyclosporine), and other laboratory tests: liver function tests, serial troponins, type and hold, coagulation studies, arterial blood gas, AED levels, toxicology screen (urine and blood), and inborn errors of metabolism.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^112iEud2]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The assessment of calcium status on the intensive care unit (ICU) is also inconsistent. Approximately 50% of total circulating calcium is ionized, which is the biologically active form. Of the remainder, around 40% is bound to plasma proteins, particularly albumin, and a further 10% to anions such as phosphate, sulphate and citrate. As measurements of total calcium are traditionally more accessible than those of ionized calcium, formulas are used to correct the total calcium concentration for variations in albumin concentration in order to reflect ionized calcium concentrations. However, several factors can alter the proportion of total calcium that is ionized and studies have shown that adjusted calcium formulae do not provide a reliable substitute for ionized calcium in various groups of critically ill patients. Despite this, adjusted calcium continues to be used in many ICUs to guide clinical practice.

Other biochemical abnormalities are also common in critically ill patients, with derangements of sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, lactate and albumin frequently seen. Magnesium and phosphate concentrations are known to affect calcium homeostasis, however there has been little study of the interaction of these abnormalities in the context of hypocalcemia and greater understanding could improve the therapeutic approach to hypocalcemic patients.

We retrospectively reviewed data from 1,038 admissions to an ICU in which calcium supplementation is routinely given, in this case guided by the patients' adjusted calcium level. The primary objectives were to establish the clinical course of hypocalcemia early in admission and the relationship of this to outcome, and to assess the impact of calcium supplementation on normalization of calcium concentration and outcome. In addition, we determined the suitability of using adjusted calcium levels in place of ionized calcium to guide clinical practice and examined the association of various biochemical derangements with hypocalcemia.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^112qVjWc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory Ordering Patterns

When looking at all tests collected during the study period (and allowing for more than 1 measurement per patient), there were 7 274 442 serum total calcium tests, 6 546 561 serum albumin tests, and 919 381 ionized calcium tests (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1). The majority of total calcium measurements (54.8%; n = 3 990 000) were ordered with a serum albumin, suggesting that albumin-adjusted calcium corrections were commonly used in clinical practice; less than half (44.9%; n = 3 265 467) of total calcium measurements were ordered alone, and very rarely (0.5%; n = 36 521) total calcium was ordered with an ionized calcium. In most cases when a serum albumin was measured (60.9%; n = 3 990 000), it was with a total calcium, suggesting that these were likely ordered with the intention of being used for calculating an adjusted calcium.

Ordering patterns were similar, irrespective of patient age, sex, or kidney function (eTable 7 in Supplement 1) and over time (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1). Ionized calcium was mostly ordered in inpatient and emergency department settings (94.7%; n = 870 679) compared with outpatient settings (4.4%; n = 40 370), whereas approximately half of the orders for combined total calcium and albumin were from the outpatient setting (55.1%; n = 2 197 193) (eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

### Clinician responses to a clinical decision support advisory for high risk of torsades de pointes [^116T9g54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Implementing a CDS advisory for risk of TdP appeared to be effective in clinicians modifying medication therapy or monitoring patients by ordering an ECG. Differences in response to the advisory were observed depending on the medication that evoked the warning. Ordering a routine ECG occurred in response to ≈20% of warnings, although ECGs were only ordered 14% of the time with ondansetron orders. Antibiotics and ondansetron accounted for the majority of the medications that evoked the TdP risk advisory. Incoming orders for ondansetron were the most frequently canceled. This may be explained by ondansetron being frequently prescribed "as needed" and some alternative medications in the antiemetic class have a lower risk of causing TdP. The lower rate of ECG ordering observed with ondansetron may be explained by the high rate of canceling incoming ondansetron orders and thus potentially obviating the need for an ECG.

Ordering electrolyte replacement via protocols was generally less frequent than ordering ECGs or canceling orders for medications with a known risk of TdP. One explanation for the lower rate of this action is that the option to order these electrolyte replacement protocols was properly programmed to only appear if a patient's most recent laboratory values fell below the low thresholds (magnesium < 2.0 mg/dL, potassium < 3.5 mEq/L, and ionized calcium < 4.5 mg/dL or total calcium < 7.0 mg/dL). Because most patients' electrolytes are not below these thresholds, the option to order electrolyte replacement protocols was not provided in most cases. In addition, if the patient was already on an electrolyte replacement protocol (common and found on most admission order sets at our hospitals), this option did not appear.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^113jVQYi]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — monitoring and timing after thyroidectomy requires anticipating the delayed calcium nadir and structured labs, as the nadir may occur 24–72 hours after thyroidectomy; postoperative measurement of absolute values and trends of total or ionized calcium blood levels are the mainstays of clinical monitoring, and at least one perioperative serum albumin level should be measured to allow calculation of corrected calcium; the cost of measuring ionized calcium level can be significantly higher than measuring serum calcium.

### American Thyroid Association statement on outpatient thyroidectomy [^114USbHL]. Thyroid (2013). Medium credibility.

Outpatient thyroidectomy — potential disadvantages note that the major postoperative considerations are the risks of bleeding, hypocalcemia, nausea, and vomiting leading to dehydration and an inability to take essential oral medications and pain control, and that some surgeons recommend acquisition of calcium levels on the first postoperative day; the most significant disadvantage is postoperative neck hematoma, with older studies reporting that about half of postoperative bleeding occurs later than 6 hours after thyroidectomy, while more recent studies aggregating more than 1250 outpatients found only 1 hematoma within 24 hours and two others beyond this 24-hour timeframe, representing a hematoma rate of less than 0.3%.

### Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) [^113x4zRM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The optimal daily dose of Rocaltrol must be carefully determined for each patient. Rocaltrol can be administered orally either as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg) or as an oral solution (1 mcg/mL). Rocaltrol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.

The effectiveness of Rocaltrol therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.

Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on Rocaltrol may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.

During the titration period of treatment with Rocaltrol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of Rocaltrol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month (or as given below for individual indications). Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.

Dialysis Patients

The recommended initial dose of Rocaltrol is 0.25 mcg/day. If a satisfactory response in the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease state is not observed, dosage may be increased by 0.25 mcg/day at 4- to 8-week intervals. During this titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly, and if hypercalcemia is noted, the drug should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase should be determined periodically.

Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to Rocaltrol doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.

Oral Rocaltrol may normalize plasma-ionized calcium in some uremic patients, yet fail to suppress parathyroid hyperfunction. In these individuals with autonomous parathyroid hyper-function, oral Rocaltrol may be useful to maintain normocalcemia, but has not been shown to be adequate treatment for hyperparathyroidism.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^111HSt13]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How accurate are the calcium adjustment formulas that are used in clinical practice?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 22 658 patients, adjusted calcium levels were modestly correlated with ionized calcium; these generally fared no better than unadjusted total calcium alone and had the tendency to systematically underestimate true hypocalcemia and overestimate true hypercalcemia.

Meaning

These results suggest that the unadjusted total calcium is the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings.

Measurements and Main Results

Total calcium, albumin-adjusted calcium, and ionized calcium were measured in critically ill patients during an 8-wk period. Calcium was adjusted for albumin using the formula that is most frequently used in The Netherlands. Using ionized calcium as the gold standard, albumin-adjusted calcium overestimated hypercalcemia and totally missed hypocalcemia. The same seemed to be true for other formulas used for albumin or protein adjustment of calcium concentrations.

Conclusions

Albumin-adjusted calcium cannot be used in an intensive care setting to monitor reliably the calcium levels in critically ill patients and should be replaced by measurement of ionized calcium.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria… [^11446eEp]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points The serum calcium levels and spot urine calcium to creatinine ratios are age specific; therefore, it is important to compare each value to the age-appropriate range before deciding if the value is atypical. To determine the level of active calcium, measure the serum concentration of ionized calcium or measure both serum total calcium and albumin. "Corrected" total calcium, based on the level of serum calcium, is estimated as follows: Adjusted total calcium = measured total calcium +. Patients with acute and symptomatic hypocalcemia require hospital admission and treatment with intravenous calcium. In patients with hypercalcemia, if calcium levels are less than 12 mg/dL and the patient has no symptoms, treatment of hypercalcemia is usually unnecessary. However, patients with calcium levels greater than 14 mg/dL should be hospitalized and treated aggressively, regardless of symptoms.

Most patients with hypercalciuria may be treated as outpatients unless they develop urinary tract obstruction caused by a renal stone.

### Critical values comparison: a college of American pathologists Q-probes survey of 163 clinical laboratories [^113Gxth2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Critical laboratory values are values that may be indicative of life-threatening conditions requiring rapid clinical intervention. Designation of critical values by clinical laboratories is required by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and regulatory agencies. The development of critical values often involves consultation with clinical services. Also, questions are frequently asked about how critical values compare between institutions.

Objective

To examine and compare critical value ranges for selected common critical value analytes. Additional specific questions addressed the source of these values, the inclusion of specific items on a critical values list, and the procedures for establishing such lists.

Design

A total of 163 clinical laboratories provided critical values for potassium, calcium, magnesium, thyroid-stimulating hormone, hemoglobin, platelet count, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Collected data were subjected to analysis for statistical variation. A questionnaire regarding demographic characteristics, institutional practices, and critical values management was also completed by participants.

Results

There was slight variation in pediatric and adult critical values used by the central 80% of study laboratories. Three areas of interest were noted: (1) 27% of laboratories allowed nonpractitioners to accept inpatient critical value reports, (2) there was nonconsensus regarding the handling of outpatient critical values during weekday versus evening/weekend hours, and (3) only 56% of respondents had a written critical values policy or procedure.

Conclusions

Pediatric and adult critical values for the selected analytes were consistent in a comparison between the 163 clinical laboratories. Several weaknesses in current critical values management were identified. A consensus critical values list that may be of value to other institutions was assembled.

### Is the calcium correct? Measuring serum calcium in dialysis patients [^115xN5XX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in calcium concentration are frequent in patients receiving dialysis therapy. Most cases of both hypo- and hypercalcemia are mild and asymptomatic. There is concern, however, that, on the one hand, hypocalcemia can drive hyperparathyroidism and eventually lead to gland hypertrophy and autonomous function. Hypercalcemia, on the other hand, can be associated with increased extraosseous calcium and phosphate deposition leading to vascular calcification with an attendant mortality and morbidity. Calcium exists in three main forms in the blood: the physiologically active free or ionized fraction (terms often used interchangeably), a protein bound fraction, and a fraction complexed to other anions. Although the ionized calcium can readily be measured using ion-specific electrodes, it is the total calcium that is most commonly measured because of sample handling and cost concerns. As it is the free or ionized form that is biologically active (and therefore of most relevance), a number of adjustment formulae have been derived to "correct" the total calcium for changes in albumin, protein, and complexing ion concentrations. These formulae show good statistical correlation with measured ionized calcium in populations studied as a whole, but are generally poor predictors of true ionized hypo- or hypercalcemia in individual patients. International guideline committees in nephrology recommend frequent assessment of calcium levels in dialysis patients and recommend that these levels be kept within the normal reference range. These guidelines are less clear on which measurement of calcium should be used to guide clinical decision making. This review examines the merits of making any adjustment to the total calcium measurement, and suggests when it is appropriate to measure the ionized or free calcium.

### Trends in diagnostic tests ordered for children: a retrospective analysis of 1.7 million laboratory test requests in oxfordshire, UK from 2005 to 2019 [^111JuU3e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

The proportion of children in Oxfordshire receiving at least one test in any setting increased by 39% (from 8.8% to 12.3%, figure 2 and online supplemental table 3). Increases were highest in the outpatient setting, where the proportion of children receiving at least one test increased by 84% (from 2.2% to 4.0%).

Figure 2
Proportion of children in Oxfordshire who had at least one test from 2005 to 2019 overall, and in each healthcare setting.

Test ranking

The most frequently ordered tests are shown by setting and age group in figure 3. The top five tests were: full blood count; urea and electrolytes; liver function tests; C reactive protein (CRP); and calcium, magnesium and phosphate levels. The top five tests were reasonably consistent for all age groups and settings (online supplemental table 4).

Figure 3
The most frequently requested tests for children in Oxfordshire from 2005 to 2019, by setting and age. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; FBC, full blood count.

Trends in specific test use

The temporal changes in the top 25 most frequently requested tests are shown in online supplemental figure 1. Tests that demonstrated a continuous increase included coeliac testing, creatine kinase, cerebrospinal fluid studies, folate, HbA1c, IgA, iron studies, medication level, parathyroid hormone, thyroid function test, vitamin B 12 and vitamin D. A continuous decrease in test use was observed for coagulation tests, gentamicin levels and monospot tests for glandular fever.

The AAPC for each test is presented in figure 4. Vitamin D testing had the highest AAPC, increasing by 26.5% per year (95% CI 23.7% to 29.3%, p < 0.001). Testing for glandular fever decreased by the largest margin of 8.8% per year (95% CI −11.4% to −6.1%, p < 0.001).

### Ionised hypocalcaemia in emergency and acute medicine [^117SDSLN]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Acute hypocalcaemia can be life-threatening and must be diagnosed promptly. The gold-standard investigation is ionised calcium, which is measured on most blood gas analysers. Total calcium measurements are inaccurate in severe depletion even if 'corrected' or 'adjusted' for albumin. We present an illustrative case of a woman in her 30s with symptomatic hypocalcaemia and a very low ionised calcium on VBG analysis. Emergency calcium replacement was delayed due to a falsely reassuring corrected calcium result. Our discussion includes a systematic literature review on the use of ionised calcium in emergency and acute medical settings. We suggest cognitive biases that may explain clinical over-reliance on corrected calcium, and call for the inclusion of ionised calcium values in major treatment guidelines for acute hypocalcaemia.

### Calcium chloride [^11151nGX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is administered only by slow intravenous injection (not to exceed 1 mL/min), preferably in a central or deep vein.

The usual precautions for intravenous therapy should be observed. If time permits, the solution should be warmed to body temperature. The injection should be halted if the patient complains of any discomfort; it may be resumed when symptoms disappear. Following injection, the patient should remain recumbent for a short time.

The usual adult dosage in hypocalcemic disorders ranges from 200 mg to 1 g (2–10 mL) at intervals of 1 to 3 days depending on the response of the patient and/or results of serum ionized calcium determinations. Repeated injections may be required because of rapid excretion of calcium.

The pediatric dosage in hypocalcemic disorders ranges from 2.7 to 5.0 mg/kg hydrated calcium chloride (or 0.136 to 0.252 mEq elemental calcium per kg, or 0.027 to 0.05 mL of 10% Calcium Chloride Injection per kg). No data from clinical trials is available about repeated dosages, though textbook references recommend repeat dosages q 4 to 6 hours.

Caution: 10% Calcium Chloride Injection consists of 1 gram of calcium chloride in a 10 mL syringe, or 100 mg/mL. This concentration represents 27 mg or 1.4 mEq of elemental calcium per mL. Thus, one 10 mL syringe provides 270 mg of elemental calcium. The dosage recommendation in various references is given either as amount of calcium chloride or amount of elemental calcium, and often it is not specified. Ionized calcium concentrations should be measured, to assist in dosage adjustment.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^112o7c6P]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Statement 1: Biochemical postoperative hypoparathyroidism is defined by an undetectable or low PTH (less than the lower limit of the centre-specific reference range) with or without hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.088)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 2

Evidence level: Moderate

A systematic review and meta-analysis recently analysed 188 studies on the definition and early diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism; it found that postoperative PTH measurements within 24 h had higher sensitivity and specificity than intraoperative PTH for predicting hypoparathyroidism, thresholds of < 10 pg/ml and < 15 pg/ml were both reliable for identifying patients at risk, no specific time point within the first 24 h (for example 1 h, 6 h versus 12 h versus 24 h) was superior, and any measurement within postoperative day 1 (POD1) was effective. Nowadays, measuring PTH within 24 h is considered standard practice in many endocrine surgery centres. It allows for early identification of patients at risk of hypoparathyroidism, timely initiation of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation, and safe discharge for individuals at low risk of hypoparathyroidism. This timing is also used in registry protocols and quality improvement initiatives to benchmark outcomes. In addition, measuring serum PTH levels 1–6 h after total or completion thyroidectomy provides high predictive accuracy for identifying the need for supplementation to prevent symptoms that may require readmission. This approach enables selective supplementation and supports safe early discharge, particularly in outpatient thyroidectomy protocols where timely discharge decisions are critical.

Statement 2: The first postoperative PTH level should be measured within 24 h.

Consensus: Yes (8.022)

Outliers: 9

Negative outliers: 8

Evidence level: Moderate

GA voting: Agree: 78.25%, Disagree: 21.75%. In addition, 66.78% of voters preferred this measurement to be done 1–6 h after surgery.

Hypoparathyroidism is a clinically heterogeneous condition, where biochemical markers like PTH and calcium are essential for diagnosis, but symptom severity varies widely and may not align with laboratory values.

Statement 3: Postoperative hypoparathyroidism may be an asymptomatic condition or it can become clinically apparent with a variety of manifestations ranging from mild numbness and tingling, muscle cramps, tetany, and seizures to life-threatening laryngospasm and cardiac arrhythmia.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^113s2Kce]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were reported for baseline demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. Recognizing that some patients may have multiple calcium measurements during the study period, we only considered the first total calcium per patient. For each total calcium measurement, we calculated the adjusted calcium using the 10 aforementioned formulas. The unadjusted and adjusted calcium values were then compared with the simultaneously collected ionized calcium (representing the reference standard). Overall agreement for each pair of comparisons was assessed using linear regression methods and correlation coefficients (and 95% CIs) were reported. We then assessed the potential association of using total calcium or a correction formula with the classification of clinical calcium status, compared with ionized calcium. Based on the ionized calcium value, we classified each patient according to the following categories: hypocalcemia (< 1.15 mmol/L), normocalcemia (1.15–1.35 mmol/L), or hypercalcemia (> 1.35 mmol/L). We then repeated the same categorization using the matching unadjusted total calcium (hypocalcemia < 2.10 mmol/L; normocalcemia 2.10–2.60 mmol/L; hypercalcemia > 2.60 mmol/L) and the adjusted calcium (according to the Payne formula and the simplified Payne formula) to assess the overall agreement. These were then compared using a reclassification matrix. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and RStudio version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) from March 2023 to October 2024.

### American Thyroid Association statement on outpatient thyroidectomy [^115nKN7w]. Thyroid (2013). Medium credibility.

Calcium management after total thyroidectomy — Significant temporary hypocalcemia may occur in up to 25% of patients following total thyroidectomy, usually manifesting 48–72 hours after surgery, and postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels have been utilized to facilitate prompt (same-day or 23-hour) discharge. A measurement taken in the recovery room 1–2 hours after surgery has been described as informative, and with or without the addition of calcitriol 0.5–1 mcg daily, oral regimens are used. Oral calcitriol (0.25 mcg per oral twice or thrice daily) can be added in patients with low postoperative PTH levels (< 15 pg/mL). Routine calcium monitoring may be helpful, and given the delayed action of these oral agents (1–2 hours), dosing may begin immediately upon the discovery of mild symptoms.

### Anion gap as a determinant of ionized fraction of divalent cations in hemodialysis patients [^116R151x]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Circulating levels of anions that bind to magnesium and calcium are often altered in patients with CKD. However, it is unknown how these alterations affect the ionized fraction of magnesium and calcium.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This cross-sectional study involved patients on maintenance hemodialysis and patients not on dialysis who visited the outpatient department of nephrology. We collected whole-blood samples to measure ionized magnesium and calcium concentrations. Adjusted anion gap was calculated as an integrative index of unmeasured anions.

Results

A total of 118 patients on hemodialysis and 112 patients not on dialysis were included. Although the prevalence of hypermagnesemia defined by total magnesium was much higher in patients on hemodialysis than in patients not on dialysis (69% versus 12%; P < 0.001), the prevalence of hypermagnesemia defined by ionized magnesium did not differ significantly (13% versus 18%; P = 0.28). Among patients on hemodialysis with high total magnesium, 83% had normal or low ionized magnesium. Consequently, the mean ionized fraction of magnesium in patients on hemodialysis was significantly lower than that in patients not on dialysis (51% versus 63%; P < 0.001). Similarly, the mean ionized fraction of calcium in patients on hemodialysis was lower than that in patients not on dialysis (55% versus 56%; P < 0.001). In patients on hemodialysis who had a higher adjusted anion gap than patients not on dialysis (mean [SD]: 14.1 [2.2] versus 5.1 [3.1]), the ionized fractions of magnesium and calcium were inversely associated with the adjusted anion gap. Furthermore, the anion gap significantly improved predictions of ionized magnesium and calcium in patients on hemodialysis.

Conclusions

Anions that accumulate in patients on hemodialysis contribute to the lower ionized fraction of magnesium and calcium. Equations that incorporate the anion gap provide better predictions of ionized magnesium and calcium in patients on hemodialysis.

### Performance of the coronary calcium score in an outpatient chest pain clinic and strategies for risk stratification [^113Kh7tD]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chest pain is one of the top referral reasons to cardiology outpatient clinics. The prevalence of coronary artery disease at outpatient chest pain clinics varies around 10–20%. 1, 2, 3 While majority of patients are told to be free of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) after examination and testing, this clinical encounter is a good opportunity to provide advice and initiate therapy for primary prevention.

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) test has rapid turnaround and requires little preparation. This provides the option of same‐day testing at an outpatient clinic. Depending on chest pain history, low risk patients with low CAC may be discharged on the same day with chest pain advice, saving future visits for cardiac tests and follow up. A zero calcium score is strong negative risk predictor for coronary artery disease, with a negative predictive value of 99%, sensitivity of 91%, and specificity of 64%. 4

Moreover, conventional risk scores, such as the CAD Consortium Score (CCS), depend on prior knowledge of personal cardiovascular risk factors. This disadvantages patients who do not have previous health screening. The CAC, which reflects arterial age under the influence of underlying comorbidities, can be helpful when cardiovascular risk factors are not available. In the setting stable angina where plaque formation and remodeling occur over years, underlying comorbidities leave a physiological imprint of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis, which can be quantified by the CAC.

The CAC also guides prescription of statin therapy, 5, 6 which is important in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction. While functional tests such as myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiogram give information on the area and extent of ischemia due to a coronary artery lesion, the CAC gives physicians actionable information to modify risk through optimal medical therapy. Statins are favored in non‐zero calcium scores, especially in those aged 55 and above. 7

The primary aim of this study was to determine the performance CAC as a risk classifier when added to conventional risk factor variables and chest pain history, by creating a risk model that can be applied to daily clinical use. One common challenge in clinic is lack of prior health screening, leading to underreporting of pre‐existing cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, we also looked at the performance of the CAC in the absence of cardiovascular risk factor variables.
