are antibiotics indicated NTEROPATHOGENIC E. COLI (EPEC)	Detected Abnormal
ENTEROTOXIGENIC E. COLI (ETEC)

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics are indicated for EPEC and ETEC diarrheal illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathotypes and their usual clinical course. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about management by severity and travel context. Next, I will ensure we exclude STEC when red flags are present, apply antimicrobial stewardship principles, identify special scenarios or hosts where antibiotics might be reasonable, and only then select agents and durations if truly indicated, all while double-checking the evidence base and resistance patterns.

> Let me first confirm the pathogens and mechanisms. ETEC causes secretory watery diarrhea via heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins, whereas EPEC produces an attaching-and-effacing lesion that disrupts the intestinal epithelium; critically, neither ETEC nor EPEC produces Shiga toxin, which distinguishes them from STEC and changes the risk calculus around antibiotic use [^115ygX13] [^116JFCnf] [^113cAfWP].

> Next, I should review the natural history to avoid over-treating self-limited disease. Wait, let me verify the pediatric data: in a cohort of low-risk children with single-pathogen EPEC or ETEC detected, most cases were mild and self-limited, only 8% received antibiotics initially, and among those not treated, a small minority returned for persistent symptoms; co-pathogen detections were frequent in broader series, underscoring that detection does not equal causation and that colonization is common, especially with multiplex panels [^114Zgrbc] [^113G1E69]. Hold on, I should also verify stewardship observations in real-world multiplex testing environments — there is a tendency toward inappropriate antibiotic prescribing after EPEC/EAEC results, reinforcing the principle to treat the patient, not just the lab report [^116bJj4Q].

> Now, I need to check guideline direction. The IDSA Infectious Diarrhea guidance emphasizes supportive care (oral rehydration, antiemetics like ondansetron in appropriate ages) and a severity-based approach rather than routine antibiotics for acute watery diarrhea; antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC or ETEC absent specific clinical criteria, whereas rehydration remains the cornerstone of management [^117S7csM]. For traveler's diarrhea, the ISTM consensus recommends antibiotics for moderate to severe illness based on clinical severity, not a specific pathogen result, which indirectly covers many ETEC cases given its etiologic prominence in TD [^112vsBVb] [^11395mmb].

> But wait, what if there is blood in the stool or severe abdominal pain raising concern for STEC? I should confirm the key safeguard: antibiotics are contraindicated in suspected or confirmed STEC because of increased HUS risk; thus, in dysenteric illness where STEC cannot be excluded, withhold antibiotics until STEC testing is negative and an invasive bacterial pathogen that warrants therapy is identified [^117S7csM] [^116MgTtt].

> I will now examine situations where antibiotics may be reasonable despite the general restraint. Moderate to severe traveler's diarrhea that is disabling, accompanied by fever or systemic symptoms, or results in functional compromise is a scenario in which a short antibiotic course can be considered, per ISTM guidance; persistent diarrhea beyond about 7–10 days without improvement warrants re-evaluation for alternative causes and can justify targeted therapy if ETEC/EPEC is convincingly implicated clinically; and in high-risk hosts (e.g., significant immunocompromise, very young infants with severe symptoms, frail older adults, or children with acute malnutrition) the threshold may be lower because disease severity and adverse outcomes can be amplified, particularly in malnutrition where EPEC and ST-ETEC are more strongly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea and mortality [^112vsBVb] [^11395mmb] [^111CYRf4].

> Hold on, let me reconsider stewardship and resistance before selecting any drug. E. coli resistance to several oral classes is substantial globally, and unnecessary antibiotics drive adverse effects, costs, microbiome disruption, and resistance without benefit; a stewardship mindset — right patient, right indication, right agent, right duration — remains essential in acute gastroenteritis and is supported by population modeling and policy frameworks [^115aeqa1] [^116ez1RU]. I should also double-check that positive multiplex results are aligned with the clinical syndrome, because prescribing off weakly pathogenic detections (like incidental EPEC) is a documented pitfall that can inflate inappropriate therapy rates [^116bJj4Q].

> If antibiotics are indicated by severity or host factors, I need to ensure choice and duration match guideline-backed regimens. Azithromycin is preferred in many regions (notably where fluoroquinolone resistance is high), fluoroquinolones remain options for adults in some settings, and rifaximin is appropriate for noninvasive TD where fever or dysentery are absent; single-dose or short 3-day courses are effective approaches per travel medicine guidance, with selection tailored to regional resistance and clinical phenotype, and rifaximin avoided when invasive pathogens are possible [^11395mmb] [^112vsBVb] [^116PfkuA]. I need to ensure that any regimen is withheld if there is a credible possibility of STEC until excluded, to avoid HUS risk escalation [^117S7csM] [^116MgTtt].

> Next, I should review supportive and diagnostic adjuncts that shape decisions over time. Rehydration remains the primary therapy; antiemetics can facilitate oral rehydration in children over 4 and adolescents; for persistent traveler's diarrhea beyond two weeks, testing for intestinal parasites is recommended; and in travelers recently exposed to antibiotics within 8–12 weeks, C. difficile testing should be considered as part of the differential, alongside evaluation for post-infectious IBS or underlying inflammatory bowel disease when symptoms persist [^117S7csM] [^1157vCiZ] [^111uVqXE].

> Finally, synthesizing this into practical guidance, I need to ensure the decision is severity- and host-driven, not organism-name–driven. For mild, watery, non-bloody diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts, forego antibiotics and prioritize oral rehydration and symptomatic care; for moderate to severe traveler's diarrhea or persistent symptoms where ETEC/EPEC is a plausible driver and alternative causes have been considered, a short, guideline-concordant course can be used; for high-risk hosts, consider a lower treatment threshold while carefully excluding STEC in dysenteric illness; and for asymptomatic detections or syndromes inconsistent with ETEC/EPEC, avoid antibiotics and reassess the diagnosis, because most EPEC/ETEC illnesses are self-limited and supportive care suffices in children and adults [^112vsBVb] [^117S7csM] [^114Zgrbc].

In general, **antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC** because it is usually self-limited; reserve antibiotics for severe, persistent, or high-risk cases (infants, immunocompromised, malnourished) [^111CYRf4]. For ETEC, **antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent diarrhea**, especially in travelers, to shorten illness and reduce stool output [^11395mmb]. Use azithromycin or rifaximin first-line due to rising resistance [^11395mmb]; avoid fluoroquinolones in children and pregnant women. Always prioritize rehydration and supportive care [^117S7csM], and use antibiotics only when clearly indicated to limit resistance [^116ez1RU].

## Clinical indications for antibiotic therapy

| **Attribute** | **Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)** | **Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)** |
|-|-|-|
| General recommendation | Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC infections, as they are typically self-limited and resolve with supportive care alone | Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe ETEC infections, particularly in travelers' diarrhea, to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms [^116PfkuA] |
| Indications for antibiotic therapy | Severe or persistent diarrhea (lasting > 14 days); immunocompromised patients; infants or young children with moderate-to-severe dehydration or malnutrition; outbreak settings with high morbidity or mortality [^111CYRf4] | Moderate-to-severe diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with associated symptoms such as fever, abdominal cramps, or dehydration); persistent diarrhea (> 14 days); immunocompromised patients; travelers' diarrhea with significant impact on daily activities |
| Antibiotic options | Azithromycin: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (maximum 500 mg/day); ceftriaxone: 50–75 mg/kg IV once daily (maximum 2 g/day) for severe cases or hospitalized patients | Azithromycin: 1 g single dose or 500 mg once daily for 3 days; rifaximin: 200 mg three times daily for 3 days (not recommended for invasive infections) [^11395mmb]; ciprofloxacin: 500 mg twice daily for 3 days (use with caution due to increasing resistance and safety concerns in children and pregnant women) [^116PfkuA] |
| Clinical outcomes | Antibiotic therapy in EPEC infections has been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea and bacterial shedding, particularly in severe or persistent cases | Antibiotic therapy significantly reduces the duration of diarrhea, bacterial shedding, and risk of complications in ETEC infections [^112vsBVb] |

## Antibiotic resistance considerations

Antibiotic resistance varies by region [^115aeqa1]. For **EPEC**, patterns show rising resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones [^115BzcCE]. Antibiotic selection should be guided by **local resistance data and susceptibility testing** [^116ez1RU]. For **ETEC**, strains increasingly resist fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, particularly in developing countries [^115aeqa1]. Azithromycin and rifaximin remain effective options, and ongoing resistance monitoring is essential [^11395mmb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

IDSA recommends antibiotic therapy for **moderate-to-severe travelers' diarrhea**, including ETEC infections, but not routinely for mild cases or EPEC infections. ISTM likewise recommends antibiotics for **moderate-to-severe travelers' diarrhea**, with azithromycin, rifaximin, and fluoroquinolones as options [^11395mmb].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antibiotic therapy

Benefits: Antibiotic therapy can reduce the **duration and severity of diarrhea**, bacterial shedding, and risk of complications, particularly in moderate-to-severe ETEC infections [^116PfkuA]. Risks: Adverse effects, **antibiotic-associated diarrhea** [^115Ux7Lv], and development of **antibiotic resistance** [^116ez1RU]. These risks must be balanced against the potential benefits, especially in mild or self-limited infections.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **EPEC**: Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC infections, but may be considered in severe, persistent, or high-risk cases [^112uQ4Tf]. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are recommended options when antibiotics are indicated.

- **ETEC**: Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent ETEC infections, particularly in travelers' diarrhea. Azithromycin and rifaximin are recommended first-line options, with ciprofloxacin as an alternative [^11395mmb].

- **General recommendation**: Antibiotic therapy should be guided by clinical severity, patient risk factors, local resistance patterns, and clinical guidelines [^116ez1RU]. Supportive care, including rehydration, remains the cornerstone of management for both EPEC and ETEC infections [^117S7csM].

The epidemiology, demographics, clinical presentations, and outcomes associated with enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) pathotypes in US children are not well understood.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with a stool sample submitted to the Children's Hospital Colorado clinical microbiology laboratory for testing with the BioFire FilmArray Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel from October 2015 through October 2017.

- **Results**: During the study period, 5692 patient stool samples were submitted; 679 (13%) were positive for EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC. Of note, 163/232 (70%) patients with EAEC, 282/493 (57%) with EPEC, and 49/58 (85%) with ETEC had detection of at least one other pathogen. Of all E. coli-positive stool samples, only 158/679 (23%) were from low-risk patients who were singly infected with EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC. In this cohort, most cases were associated with acute diarrhea (50%), abdominal pain (61%), and/or cramping (49%) and presented without fever (14%), emesis (28%), or lethargy (7%). Thirteen (8%) of these 158 patients received antibiotics at the time of their initial presentation to care. Of the 145 patients who did not receive antibiotics at their initial visit, 23 (16%) returned to care due to persistence of symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that the majority of patients singly infected with EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC present with mild, self-limited, gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Further research is needed to determine what role these infections play in pediatric populations.

### The effect of acute malnutrition on enteric pathogens, moderate-to-severe diarrhoea, and associated mortality in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study cohort: a post-hoc analysis [^111CYRf4]. The Lancet Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

This post-hoc exploratory analysis found typical EPEC and ST-ETEC to have a stronger association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children with acute malnutrition than among children with better nutritional status. Conversely, Shigella spp, norovirus, and sapovirus had a more pronounced association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children with better nutritional status. Children with acute malnutrition were at high risk of mortality following an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and represented nearly two-thirds of the deaths observed among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. The case fatality for every pathogen was higher among children with acute malnutrition. However, this increase was less pronounced among children with norovirus, Cryptosporidium spp, or acute watery diarrhoea.

The GEMS control group enabled this analysis to differentiate malnutrition-associated differences in diarrhoea aetiology from pathogens that are more prevalent among malnourished children due to prolonged carriage. Previous evidence suggests that malnourished children are particularly vulnerable to pathogenic E. coli. We found ST-ETEC and typical EPEC to have a stronger association with diarrhoea among children with acute malnutrition. Many of the most virulent pathogens (Shigella spp, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp) had contradictory results in relative and absolute risk models. For example, in logistic regression, Shigella spp had a stronger association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children without acute malnutrition, but this interaction was…

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: A modelling analysis [^115aeqa1]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Diarrhoea mortality has declined significantly globally and in the poorest countries, whereas diarrhoea morbidity has declined more slowly. These observed patterns have refocused attention on the positive relationship between recurring and frequent non-fatal diarrhoea episodes and childhood stunting. Childhood stunting increases the likelihood of death from diarrhoea, pneumonia, and measles, among other infections. Stunting also affects cognitive development, which might determine a child's ability to learn, their educational attainment, and future earnings.

Although rotavirus accounts for most diarrhoea-related childhood deaths, other enteric pathogens play an important role in childhood mortality and morbidity. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) conducted in Africa and Asia found that four diarrhoeal pathogens — rotavirus, Shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Cryptosporidium spp — were significantly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea, accounting for 70% of diarrhoeal disease in children younger than 5 years.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for the treatment of these pathogens. Shigella is resistant to several antibiotic classes, and several nations report greater than 50% resistance to certain antibiotic classes by pathogenic E. coli. This situation makes new prevention strategies critical. Promising interventions under development are vaccines against ETEC and Shigella, which can potentially prevent infection, morbidity, and mortality from these pathogens and combat antibiotic resistance by reducing antibiotic use.

### Phylogenetic comparisons reveal multiple acquisitions of the toxin genes by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains of different evolutionary lineages [^1111TESU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is a diverse bacterial species which is widely distributed in the environment but also exists as a commensal and pathogen of different host species. Human intestinal pathogenic E. coli causes over 160 million cases of diarrhea and an estimated 1 million deaths per year. The majority of deaths are attributable to one pathovar of E. coli, namely, enterotoxigenic E. coli. The pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic E. coli is dependent on the production of a colonization factor to promote adhesion to the intestinal epithelium and the elaboration of heat-labile or heat-stable toxins which induce a secretory diarrhea.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, little is known of the genetic background of this global pathogen. Here we demonstrate by multilocus sequence typing that enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates are present in all phylogenetic lineages of E. coli, indicating that acquisition of the toxin genes may be sufficient to generate an enterotoxigenic E. coli strain. In addition, screening of diarrheal isolates for the presence of additional genes previously associated with the virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli revealed that they were not abundant. These observations have significant implications for disease epidemiology and for the design of effective vaccines.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the 2024 IDSA guidelines recommend the administration of TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred treatments for pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin as preferred options when resistance or toxicities preclude using TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones. Aminoglycosides should be considered as an alternative option.

### Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli activates ezrin, which participates in disruption of tight junction barrier function [^114S6Rfs]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an important human intestinal pathogen, especially in infants. EPEC adherence to intestinal epithelial cells induces the accumulation of a number of cytoskeletal proteins beneath the bacteria, including the membrane-cytoskeleton linker ezrin. Evidence suggests that ezrin can participate in signal transduction. The aim of this study was to determine whether ezrin is activated following EPEC infection and if it is involved in the cross talk with host intestinal epithelial cells.

We show here that following EPEC attachment to intestinal epithelial cells, there was significant phosphorylation of ezrin, first on threonine and later on tyrosine residues. A significant increase in cytoskeleton-associated ezrin occurred following phosphorylation, suggesting activation of this molecule. Nonpathogenic E. coli and EPEC strains harboring mutations in type III secretion failed to elicit this response. Expression of dominant-negative ezrin significantly decreased the EPEC-elicited association of ezrin with the cytoskeleton and attenuated the disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions. These results suggest that ezrin is involved in transducing EPEC-initiated signals that ultimately affect host physiological functions.

### Performance of stool-testing recommendations for acute gastroenteritis when used to identify children with 9 potential bacterial enteropathogens [^116m5gFt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The ability to identify bacterial pathogens that necessitate specific clinical management or public health action in children with acute gastroenteritis is crucial to patient care and public health. However, existing stool-testing guidelines offer inconsistent recommendations, and their performance characteristics are unknown. We evaluated six leading gastroenteritis guidelines, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Infectious Disease Society of America, to determine when to test children's stool for bacterial enteropathogens.

- **Methods**: Via two emergency departments in Alberta, Canada, we enrolled 2,447 children under 18 years old who presented with three or more episodes of diarrhea and/or vomiting in a 24-hour period. All participants were tested for nine bacterial enteropathogens: Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia. Patient data gathered at the index visit were used to determine whether guidelines would recommend testing. Sensitivity and specificity to recommend testing for children with bacterial enteropathogens were calculated for each guideline.

- **Results**: Outcome data were available for 2,391 (97.7%) participants, and 6% (144/2,391) of participants tested positive for a bacterial enteropathogen. Guideline sensitivity ranged from 25.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.7–33.0%) to 66.9% (95% CI 59.3–74.6%), and varied for individual pathogens. Guideline specificity for all bacterial enteropathogens ranged from 63.6% (95% CI 61.6–65.6%).

The evaluation of these guidelines highlights the variability in recommendations and the need for improved stool-testing protocols.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^116wXcvv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains differ in several characteristics. Typical EPEC, a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, is rare in industrialized countries, where atypical EPEC seems to be a more important cause of diarrhea. For typical EPEC, the only reservoir is humans; for atypical EPEC, both animals and humans can be reservoirs. Typical and atypical EPEC also differ in genetic characteristics, serotypes, and virulence properties. Atypical EPEC is more closely related to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and like STEC, these strains appear to be emerging pathogens.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^1162QdfQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Morbidity, mortality, and poor nutritional outcomes of young children due to diarrheal illnesses are leading health concerns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is a leading cause of malnutrition and the third leading cause of death in children aged < 5 years, accounting for nearly half a million deaths in this age group each year. Of these diarrheal deaths, approximately 90% occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are the foremost pathotypes of E. coli associated with childhood diarrheal illnesses. According to the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), Shigella and heat stable (ST)-toxin producing ETEC, either alone or along with heat labile (LT)-toxin producing ETEC, are the leading enteric pathogens associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children aged < 5 years. Pathogens associated with increased risk of infant mortality were ST-ETEC and typical EPEC, and the risk of mortality was 8.5 times higher in MSD children than in asymptomatic children within the first 2 years of life.

Apart from diarrheal morbidity and mortality, ETEC and EPEC have also been reported to be linked with other symptoms or conditions caused by undernutrition, especially stunting, among children aged < 5 years. Both ST-ETEC and LT-ETEC develop increasing virulence due to colonization and adherence to the intestinal mucosal membrane, resulting in profuse loss of water and electrolytes leading to exacerbation of dehydration.

### Interactions of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli with pediatric and adult intestinal biopsy specimens during early adherence [^11328PYt]. Infection and Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains cause watery diarrhea almost exclusively in young children. The basis for this age discrimination has never been determined, but it may be related to host cell receptors. During infection, EPEC strains express type IV bundle-forming pili composed of repeating subunits of the protein called bundlin. The very first interaction between EPEC and in vitro-cultured epithelial cells is mediated by the binding of alpha-bundlin to a carbohydrate receptor that contains, at a minimum, the N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) glycan sequence. However, bundlins expressed from the beta-bundlin allele do not bind LacNAc glycan sequences.

Herein, we investigated whether EPEC strains use alpha-bundlin to mediate early adherence to human intestinal biopsy specimens cultured in vitro by assessing the ability of isogenic EPEC mutants expressing either the alpha(1)- or beta(1)-bundlin allele or a bundlin-deficient EPEC strain to bind to these specimens. Furthermore, we directly compared the abilities of a wild-type EPEC strain to bind to the epithelial surfaces of both human adult and pediatric biopsy specimens. Our results demonstrate that beta-bundlin does not act as an adhesin during early EPEC adherence to adult duodenal biopsy specimens. The results also indicate that EPEC binds equally well to adult and pediatric biopsy specimens in an early adherence assay. This result is supported by the finding that the early adherence of EPEC to both adult and pediatric biopsy specimens was inhibited by LacNAc neoglycoconjugates, suggesting that organisms express.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections [^112qCGNZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically concerning Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend not changing or extending antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Improvement in detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in patients with travelers' diarrhea by increasing the number of E. coli colonies tested [^116XS4RQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

No cause of one-third of travelers' diarrhea (TD) cases can be detected despite microbiologic assessment. We propose that these pathogen-negative TD cases include undetected enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). As a standard in diagnostic microbiology, samples of five E. coli colonies were tested to detect ETEC from stool cultures.

We compared the sensitivities and the number of ETEC detected by 20 colonies with those of 5, 10, and 15 colonies. The percent detection of ETEC with five E. coli colonies was significantly different from that using 20 E. coli colonies. Of the 116 subjects studied, the number positive for ETEC for 5, 10, 15, and 20 colonies tested were 22 (19.0%), 37 (31.9%), 45 (38.8%), and 46 (39.7%), respectively. Based on our results, we recommend the testing of at least 10 E. coli colonies for optimum detection of ETEC in patients with TD.

### Multiplex PCR for diagnosis of enteric infections associated with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli [^1168QNmR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A multiplex PCR for the detection of three categories of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli was developed. With this method, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and enterotoxigenic E. coli were identified in fecal samples from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, watery diarrhea, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome and from food-borne outbreaks.

### Emerging themes in the molecular pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^1125joGr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, in the absence of a broadly protective vaccine, young children in low-middle-income countries will likely continue to bear the burden of acute diarrheal illness imposed on them by ETEC. Resolving the role of more recently discovered virulence proteins in the molecular pathogenesis of ETEC may focus vaccine development on antigens that encompass the breadth of ETEC.

While ETEC have been epidemiologically linked to the development of sequelae, including malnutrition, additional study is needed at the molecular level to understand how these pathogens might promote changes in the small-intestinal architecture that underlie the sequelae. It is becoming clear, however, that one or both toxins secreted by ETEC can affect a variety of cellular pathways that govern normal homeostasis and ultimately the absorptive capacity of the small intestine, in addition to causing diarrhea. An ideal ETEC vaccine would mitigate or prevent both the acute diarrheal illness caused by ETEC as well as the substantial burden of nondiarrheal morbidity linked to these pathogens.

### Emerging themes in the molecular pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^114MCM6x]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are ubiquitous diarrheal pathogens that thrive in areas lacking basic human needs such as clean water and sanitation. These genetically plastic organisms cause significant morbidity among disadvantaged young children, manifesting as both acute diarrheal illness and the sequelae of malnutrition and growth impairment. The recent discovery of additional plasmid-encoded virulence factors and the elucidation of their critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of ETEC may inform new approaches to developing broadly protective vaccines. Although these pathogens have been closely linked epidemiologically with non-diarrheal sequelae, these conditions remain poorly understood.

Furthermore, while the canonical effects of ETEC toxins on cellular signaling promoting diarrhea are well established, emerging data suggest that these toxins may also drive changes in intestinal architecture and associated sequelae. Understanding the molecular events underlying these changes could inform optimal approaches to developing vaccines that prevent acute diarrhea and ETEC-associated sequelae.

### Single multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect diverse loci associated with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli [^112r1eVT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We developed and tested a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, and Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli. This PCR is specific, sensitive, and rapid in detecting target isolates in stool and food. Because of its simplicity, economy, and efficiency, this protocol warrants further evaluation in large, prospective studies of polymicrobial substances.

### Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: Typical pathogens [^112uXCsK]. Emerging infectious diseases (2006). Low credibility.

This communication illustrates two principles that should be recognized more generally with regard to diarrheogenic E. coli: one can authoritatively implicate a particular strain as a pathogen by (only) outbreak implication or by volunteer studies, but one cannot definitively prove by any data that a putative pathotype is not a human pathogen; and the implication of pathogenicity for one strain is not sufficient to implicate any similar strain as a pathogen. Once definitive evidence is presented that a particular strain is pathogenic, the challenge is to determine the genotypic or phenotypic fingerprints that permit extrapolation to other strains. This obstacle has long proven daunting for the enteroaggregative pathotype, which has been shown to be pathogenic in both volunteer studies and outbreaks, and it may prove similarly frustrating for aEPEC.

Diarrheal epidemiology studies today are able to identify a likely etiologic agent for most patients, in contrast to studies of 20 years ago, because of improved diagnostic tests and the identification of new pathogens. However, the task is not finished. Additional studies are needed in many places to refine our understanding of putative and emerging pathogens and to determine their full epidemiologic roles.

### Escherichia coli and community-acquired gastroenteritis, Melbourne, Australia [^113YHtGt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Examining the seasonal occurrence of gastroenteritis from all causes showed that gastroenteritis was more common in the warmer months; 65.7% of cases occurred in the six months from October through March. Infections with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) reflected this distribution, with 80% and 65.5% of infections with these bacteria, respectively, occurring during the same period. The high incidence of EAEC in February and March may have been caused by small family outbreaks; nine of 25 cases during this period originated in three households.

### Parenteral vaccination with recombinant EtpA glycoprotein impairs enterotoxigenic colonization [^116cidoa]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a heterogeneous, diarrheagenic pathogenic variant (pathovar) of E. coli, defined by the production of heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins. These pathogens are a leading cause of diarrheal illness in young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as in immunologically naïve travelers to areas where clean water and sanitation remain limited. These pathogens remain a significant cause of death due to acute diarrheal illness among children less than five years of age.

Although the death rate from acute illness appears to have declined appreciably over the last several decades due to the implementation of oral rehydration therapy and other measures, infections with these pathogens continue largely unabated and have been linked repeatedly to a number of non-diarrheal sequelae, including micronutrient deficiencies, malnutrition, and growth impairment. In addition, malnourished children are at substantially increased risk of death due to diarrhea caused by ETEC and other pathogens. The long-term morbidity associated with these pathogens is driven by subclinical intestinal damage, characterized by alterations in the absorptive architecture of the small intestine, a condition known as environmental enteropathy or enteric dysfunction.

Most ETEC vaccine development has focused on a group of pathovar-specific, plasmid-encoded antigens known as colonization factors (CFs). At the time of writing, at least 29 distinct antigens have been described. The ideal ETEC vaccine, oral or parenteral, would be broadly protective.

Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternative options, but do not use the latter if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Additionally, a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) may be administered as another alternative option.

### Mutual enhancement of virulence by enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^112Hb977]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are common causes of diarrhea in children in developing countries. Dual infections with both pathogens have been noted fairly frequently in studies of diarrhea around the world. In previous laboratory work, it was observed that cholera toxin and forskolin markedly potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release from the host cell, and this potentiated release was found to be mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

In this study, we examined whether the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) or the heat-stable toxin (STa, also known as ST) potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release. We found that crude ETEC culture filtrates, as well as purified ETEC toxins, did potentiate EPEC-induced ATP release in cultured T84 cells. Coinfection of T84 cells with live ETEC plus EPEC bacteria also resulted in enhanced ATP release compared to EPEC alone.

- **Chloride secretion**: In Ussing chamber studies of chloride secretion, adenine nucleotides released from the host by EPEC significantly enhanced the chloride secretory responses triggered by crude ETEC filtrates, purified STa, and the peptide hormone guanylin.

- **Vacuole formation**: Additionally, adenosine and LT had additive or synergistic effects in inducing vacuole formation in T84 cells.

Therefore, ETEC toxins and EPEC-induced damage to the host cell both enhance the virulence of the other type of E. coli. Our in vitro data demonstrate a molecular basis for a microbial interaction, which could result in increased severity of disease in vivo in individuals who are coinfected with ETEC and EPEC.

### Targeting virulence traits: Potential strategies to combat extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli infections [^114mCH32]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are capable of colonizing, invading, and inducing disease in areas of the body outside the gastrointestinal tract. The emergence of (multi)resistant ExPEC variants necessitates alternative antimicrobial strategies with reduced pressure on the selection of antibiotic resistances. Recent research efforts have focused on targeting these virulence traits and interfering with ExPEC colonization of extraintestinal niches. These strategies aim to prevent or treat ExPEC infections and reduce the risk of further emergence of antibiotic resistances.

### Drug-resistant diarrheogenic Escherichia coli, Mexico [^115BzcCE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The best characterized diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DE) groups include enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC), and Shiga toxin–producing (STEC) E. coli. STEC is also known as verotoxin-producing or enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Except for slow-fermenting sorbitol STEC (as O157:H7), DE are not routinely sought as stool pathogens in clinical laboratories worldwide, perhaps because rapid and sensitive laboratory techniques are lacking. However, DE are a leading cause of children's diarrhea in developing countries, and some are increasingly being recognized as important enteropathogens in developed countries. To establish the prevalence and resistance patterns of these microorganisms in hospitalized children in Mexico, we conducted a prospective study. E. coli strains were analyzed by using two comprehensive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and strains harboring DE genes were analyzed for their antimicrobial resistance patterns.

### Inhibition of attaching and effacing lesion formation following enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection [^113Vtmh2]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) induce cytoskeletal changes in infected epithelial cells. To further characterize host cytosolic responses to infection, a series of specific cell-signaling inhibitors were employed. Initial bacterial adhesion to HEp-2 epithelial cells was not reduced; however, alpha-actinin accumulation in infected cells was blocked by a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C inhibitor (ET-18-OCH3), phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), and a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid. A cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (NS-398), however, did not block alpha-actinin reorganization in response to EPEC and STEC infections. Understanding signal transduction responses to enteric pathogens could provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

### Outbreaks of virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli — are we in control [^114oWWoG]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The outbreaks of virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli continue to pose significant public health challenges. Despite advancements in detection and control strategies, these outbreaks highlight vulnerabilities in our current public health infrastructure.

- **Epidemiological patterns**: Recent studies indicate a rising trend in the global incidence of these outbreaks, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance systems. Enhanced screening measures and collaborative efforts between nations are pivotal for early identification and containment.

- **Public health implications**: These outbreaks often lead to increased healthcare costs and societal disruption. Public health authorities must prioritize the development of rapid response frameworks to mitigate these impacts effectively.

- **Preventive strategies**: Effective preventive strategies include promoting hygienic practices, improving sanitation systems, and developing vaccines. Community education plays a crucial role in reducing the transmission of infectious diseases.

Continuous research and adaptive strategies are essential to address the dynamic nature of these pathogenic outbreaks. Without sustained attention and resources, the control of virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli remains uncertain.

### Use of gastrointestinal syndromic multiplex molecular assays and detection of pathotypes in pediatric wards [^116bJj4Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

We observed a substantial rate of inappropriate therapy following the detection of E. coli, for 45% of the 69 introduced antibiotics. Interestingly, one study in adults showed that the use of gastrointestinal mPCR leads to a decrease in antimicrobial prescriptions, with 14.5% of discontinuation versus 4.5% in the standard stool culture group (P < 0.01). Conversely, a randomized controlled trial on adults showed that routine molecular point-of-care testing for gastrointestinal pathogens, despite improving time to results and reducing time spent in single-occupancy isolation rooms, was also accompanied by increased antibiotic use.

In addition, a previous French pediatric study showed that antibiotic therapy was initiated in 16.3% of cases following a positive mPCR result, and only 0.6% of cases saw antibiotics discontinued. Here, many cases with EPEC and EAEC detection received antibiotic treatment, suggesting that a positive result, even for weakly pathogenic bacteria, might lead to the prescription of antibiotics despite available guidelines.

The AMS team conducted few prescription reviews (12%) and several were retrospectively deemed inappropriate despite existing recommendations. This underscores the potential inconsistencies in the literature and the challenges in applying guidelines based on microbiological results, even by experts like the AMS team, especially in facilities caring for patients with significant comorbidities. The limited involvement of the AMS team here was primarily due to reviews being conducted only at the clinicians' request.

### Identification and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies for immunoprophylaxis against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection [^1177DAoq]. Infection and Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the main causes of diarrhea in infants in the developing world, as well as the major cause of traveler's diarrhea. Transmission of ETEC occurs when contaminated food or water is ingested. ETEC infections are characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and in some cases mild fever. Symptoms usually occur 1 to 3 days after infection and last for a few days. When adult travelers develop ETEC diarrhea, a short course of antibiotics can decrease the duration and volume of diarrhea. However, ETEC strains are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and there are currently no licensed vaccines for protecting travelers against ETEC diarrhea.

ETEC mediates small intestine adherence through filamentous bacterial surface structures known as colonization factors (CF). Once bound to the small intestine, the bacteria produce heat-labile toxins (LT) and/or heat-stable toxins (ST) that, through a cascade process, cause a net flow of water from the cell into the intestinal lumen, resulting in watery diarrhea. ETEC vaccine development efforts have focused on the induction of host immunity against CFs or toxins by using cellular or subunit-based approaches. LT has been considered a possible target based on its strong immunogenicity, while ST was not initially considered due to poor immunogenicity and potent toxicity. Progress has been made recently in the identification of effective LT-ST toxoids. However, anti-ST and anti-LT antibody responses may not be sufficient for effective protection against ETEC diarrhea.

### Comparative analysis of locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity islands of atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^111ZmRXm]. Infection and Immunity (2004). Low credibility.

The pathogenicity of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is linked to the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) that directly transfers bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. Atypical diffusely adhering EPEC (DA-EPEC) strains harbor homologues of the LEE but lack the EPEC adherence factor plasmid. These strains have been increasingly associated with outbreaks of diarrhea.

In this study, we have completely sequenced and functionally characterized LEE pathogenicity islands derived from the clinical DA-EPEC isolates 3431 (O8:H-) and 0181 (O119:H9:K61). LEE3431 and LEE0181 exhibit genetic organization analogous to that of the prototype LEE (E2348/69). Genes constituting the T3SS apparatus are highly conserved, although LEE-encoded effector proteins exhibit major differences. Transfer and functional expression of LEE0181 in an E. coli XL1 blue MR background demonstrated that LEE0181 contains all the information necessary for signal transduction and pedestal formation.

### Rapid molecular detection of gastrointestinal pathogens and its role in antimicrobial stewardship [^113G1E69]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

We aimed to detect the etiological agents of acute diarrhea using a molecular gastrointestinal pathogen test (MGPT) and to assess the impact of MGPT on antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). This is a prospective observational study conducted between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2017. We included consecutive patients who had acute diarrhea. At the end of 2015, we implemented ASP in acute diarrhea cases and compared outcomes in the pre-ASP and post-ASP periods.

An FDA-cleared multiplexed gastrointestinal PCR panel system, the BioFire FilmArray (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), which detects 20 pathogens in stool, was used. In 499 out of 699 patients (71%), at least one pathogen was detected. Among 314 adults with positive MGPT results, 101 (32%) enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), 71 (23%) enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), 68 (22%) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 55 (18%) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), 48 (15%) Campylobacter, 21 (7%) Salmonella, 20 (6%) Clostridium difficile, and 17% Norovirus were detected.

Among 185 children, the following strains were detected: 55 (30%) EPEC, 37 (20%) C. difficile, 32 (17%) Norovirus, 29 (16%) EAEC, 22 (12%) STEC, 21 (11%) ETEC, 21 (11%) Campylobacter, 20 (11%) Salmonella, and 16 (5%) Rotavirus. Inappropriate antibiotic use decreased in the post-ASP period compared with the pre-ASP period among inpatients (42.9% and 25.8%, respectively; P = 0.023). Using MGPT in clinical practice significantly decreased the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Detection of high rates of C. difficile in children and Salmonella spp., as well

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^116JFCnf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. In industrialized countries, the frequency of these organisms has decreased, but they continue to be an important cause of diarrhea. The central mechanism of EPEC pathogenesis is a lesion called attaching and effacing (A/E), characterized by microvilli destruction, intimate adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelium, pedestal formation, and aggregation of polarized actin and other elements of the cytoskeleton at sites of bacterial attachment. The fluorescent actin staining test allows the identification of strains that produce A/E lesions through detection of aggregated actin filaments beneath the attached bacteria. Ability to produce A/E lesions has also been detected in strains of Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC]) and in strains of other bacterial species.

The genetic determinants for the production of A/E lesions are located on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island that contains the genes encoding intimin, a type III secretion system, a number of secreted (Esp) proteins, and the translocated intimin receptor named Tir. Two LEE insertion sites have been described on the E. coli chromosome.

### Antibiotic-associated apoptotic enterocolitis in the absence of a defined pathogen: The role of intestinal microbiota depletion [^115Ux7Lv]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is a major risk factor for the development of diarrhea and colitis with varying severity. Often, the origin of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal deterioration remains elusive, and no specific infectious agents can be discerned.

- **Patients**: We represent three cases of intractable high-volume diarrhea associated with combined antibiotic and steroid therapy in critically ill patients not fitting into established disease entities. Cases presented with severe apoptotic enterocolitis resembling acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease. Microbiologic workup precluded known enteropathogens, but microbiota analysis revealed a severely depleted gut microbiota with concomitant opportunistic pathogen overgrowth.

- **Interventions**: Fecal microbiota transplantation, performed in one patient, was associated with correction of dysbiosis, rapid clinical improvement, and healing of enterocolitis.

- **Conclusions**: Our series represents a severe form of antibiotic-associated colitis in critically ill patients signified by microbiota depletion. Reestablishment of a physiologic gastrointestinal microbiota might be beneficial for this condition.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^115QGtW8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

The association of clinico-epidemiological factors with ETEC or EPEC infection is analyzed among children with moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) and in asymptomatic children.

According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis of ETEC cases, children aged 12–23 months had higher odds of having ETEC MSD compared to children aged 0–11 months. For asymptomatic ETEC infection, there was no such age variation. Children from middle-class households showed a higher likelihood of being infected with asymptomatic ETEC compared to those from the richest households. However, no such association was observed between the wealth index and ETEC MSD. The presence of Campylobacter in stool samples had a significant positive association with ETEC infection both in asymptomatic and MSD children. Among the clinical features of MSD, sunken eyes had a significant positive association, whereas dysentery and fever had negative associations with ETEC infection.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis of EPEC revealed a lower likelihood of EPEC-positive MSD cases in both the 12–23 months and 24–59 months age groups. In asymptomatic cases, only the 24–59 months age group was less likely to get EPEC infection compared to children aged 0–11 months. Asymptomatic EPEC infection is significantly higher in children from lower–middle-class families compared to those from rich families.

### What is antimicrobial stewardship [^116ez1RU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). High credibility.

Use of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' has grown exponentially in recent years, typically referring to programs and interventions that aim to optimize antimicrobial use. Although antimicrobial stewardship originated within human healthcare, it is increasingly applied in broader contexts, including animal health and One Health. As the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' becomes more common, it is important to consider what antimicrobial stewardship is, as well as what it is not.

- **Aims**: To review the emergence and evolution of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship'.
- **Sources**: We searched and reviewed existing literature and official documents, which mostly focused on antibiotics. We contacted the authors of the first publications that mentioned antimicrobial stewardship.

- **Content**: We describe the historical background behind how antimicrobial stewardship came into use in clinical settings. We discuss challenges emerging from the varied descriptions of antimicrobial stewardship in the literature, including an over-emphasis on individual prescriptions, an under-emphasis on the societal implications of antimicrobial use, and language translation problems.

- **Implications**: To help address these challenges, we suggest viewing antimicrobial stewardship as a strategy, a coherent set of actions that promote using antimicrobials responsibly. We stress the continuous need for 'responsible use' to be defined and translated into context-specific and time-specific actions. Furthermore, we present examples of actions that can be undertaken within antimicrobial stewardship.

### Development of a DNA microarray for detection and serotyping of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^111Afm6U]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common pathogen worldwide, causing infectious diarrhea, especially traveler's diarrhea. Traditional physiological assays, immunoassays, and PCR-based methods for the detection of ETEC target the heat-labile enterotoxin and/or the heat-stable enterotoxin. Separate serotyping methods using antisera are required to determine the ETEC serogroup.

In this study, we developed a DNA microarray that can simultaneously detect enterotoxin genes and the 19 most common O serogroup genes in ETEC strains. The specificity and reproducibility of this approach were verified by hybridization to 223 strains: 50 target reference or clinical strains and 173 other strains, including those belonging to other E. coli O serogroups and closely related species. The sensitivity of detection was determined to be 50 ng of genomic DNA or 10^8 CFU per mL of organisms in pure culture.

The random PCR strategy used in this study with minimal bias provides an effective alternative to multiplex PCR for the detection of pathogens using DNA microarrays. The assay holds promise for applications in the clinical diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of pathogenic microorganisms.

### Emerging themes in the molecular pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^117QPwDE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are common pathogens that comprise a genetically diverse diarrheagenic E. coli pathovar defined by the production of heat-labile toxin (LT) and/or heat-stable toxin (ST). It is estimated that worldwide, hundreds of millions of symptomatic enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) infections occur annually, a burden predominantly borne by young children of low-middle-income countries. Here, ETEC remain a major cause of deaths due to acute diarrheal illness. Abundant in low-middle-income regions where clean water and sanitation remain limited, ETEC are perennially the most common pathogen isolated from travelers with infectious diarrhea. Surprisingly, however, they have also been associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases in more developed areas, including the United States, where recently introduced culture-independent methods may accelerate their identification.

### Point-of-prescription interventions to improve antimicrobial stewardship [^111pEBYn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship is pivotal to improving patient outcomes, reducing adverse events, decreasing healthcare costs, and preventing further emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In an era in which antimicrobial resistance is increasing, judicious antimicrobial use is the responsibility of every healthcare provider. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have made headway in improving antimicrobial prescribing using such "top-down" methods as formulary restriction and prospective audit with feedback; however, engagement of prescribers has not been fully explored. Strategies that include frontline prescribers and other unit-based healthcare providers have the potential to expand stewardship, both to augment existing centralized ASPs and to provide alternative approaches to perform stewardship at healthcare facilities with limited resources. This review discusses interventions focusing on antimicrobial prescribing at the point of prescription as well as a pilot project to engage unit-based healthcare providers in antimicrobial stewardship.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^114pXrMy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 37% and 40% ETEC positivity was found in children aged 0–11 months and 12–23 months, respectively, while EPEC positivity was predominantly found in the 0–11 months age group (41%) among asymptomatic children. Mothers of EPEC-positive asymptomatic children more often practiced breastfeeding than those of EPEC-negative children, but this was not statistically significant. In children aged 24–59 months, non-breastfeeding was associated with higher odds of ETEC-related diarrhea (OR 1.51, P = 0.001), suggesting non-breastfeeding may increase susceptibility to ETEC infections in this age group, while no significant association was found for EPEC in any age group.

Mothers of asymptomatic ETEC-negative children were more literate than those of ETEC-positive asymptomatic children. Tube wells as a source of drinking water were more frequently used by households of ETEC-negative asymptomatic children compared to those of ETEC-positive asymptomatic children. Handwashing before cooking was practiced more often in ETEC-negative households.

- **Sanitation practices**: Use of improved sanitation facilities, soap for handwashing, and handwashing before nursing a child or preparing baby food were higher in EPEC-positive than negative households.

- **Co-pathogens**: Detection of Campylobacter as a co-pathogen was more often observed in asymptomatic ETEC-positive than ETEC-negative children.

### Emerging enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains [^112KaPRH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Prevalence of distinct combinations of virulence-related DNA sequences in eae + EAF- stx- Escherichia coli strains outside the EPEC serogroups was studied in three cities in Brazil. All strains hybridized with the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) A, LEE B, LEE C, and LEE D probes constructed by McDaniel et al, suggesting they bear a complete LEE region.

DNA sequences similar to bfpA were detected in 14 (14.1%) of the 99 strains studied. However, only 2 expressed Bfp in Western blot experiments; these two strains also carried perA and showed aggregative adherence/LA in 3 hours. The HeLa pattern of the remaining bfpA+ strains varied, but none had compact clusters in 3 hours, which is typical of LA. Therefore, Bfp expression was found only in strains showing aggregative adherence/LA in 3 hours, as in typical LA of EPEC.

PCR assays with specific primers for the variable region of intimin were used to identify five intimin types (α, β, γ, δ, and ε). Most strains had a nontypable intimin (64.6%), with distribution variations seen in approximately 70% of São Paulo and 29%–35% in Rio de Janeiro and Ribeirão Preto. Recently, new schemes were proposed to identify intimin subtypes, which were not tested. The prevalence of typable intimins varied among the three areas analyzed. Intimin subtypes β (11.1%) and γ (12.1%) prevailed, while intimin ε was not found. The intimin types of two strains were not determined because amplification products of the expected size were obtained.

### Vancocin [^115QTMud]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vancocin is indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. It is also used for the treatment of enterocolitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, in adult and pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.

- **Limitations of use**: Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for the aforementioned infections; therefore, Vancocin must be given orally for these infections. Orally administered Vancocin is not effective for other types of infections.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Vancocin and other antibacterial drugs, Vancocin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

### Detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli by use of melting-curve analysis and real-time multiplex PCR [^115wq2Tr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Diarrheagenic *Escherichia coli* strains are important causes of diarrhea in children from the developing world and are now being recognized as emerging enteropathogens in the developed world. Methods of detection are too expensive and labor-intensive for routine detection of these organisms to be practical. We developed a real-time fluorescence-based multiplex PCR for the detection of all six of the currently recognized classes of diarrheagenic *E. coli*. The primers were designed to specifically amplify eight different virulence genes in the same reaction: aggR for enteroaggregative *E. coli*, stIa/stIb and lt for enterotoxigenic *E. coli*, eaeA for enteropathogenic *E. coli* and Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* (STEC), stx(1) and stx(2) for STEC, ipaH for enteroinvasive *E. coli*, and daaD for diffusely adherent *E. coli* (DAEC).

Eighty-nine of ninety diarrheagenic *E. coli* and 36/36 nonpathogenic *E. coli* strains were correctly identified using this approach (specificity, 1.00; sensitivity, 0.99). The single false negative was a DAEC strain. The total time between preparation of DNA from *E. coli* colonies on agar plates and completion of PCR and melting-curve analysis was less than 90 minutes. The cost of materials was low. Melting-point analysis of real-time multiplex PCR is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive method for detection of diarrheagenic *E. coli*.

### Single multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect diverse loci associated with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli [^112Agb4x]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolates were identified in both patient and food samples. Specific strains such as STEC (Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli), EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli), and EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli) were detected.

### Emerging enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains [^116KbGtR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, we sought to verify the frequency with which eae+ EAF– stx– E. coli strains of non-EPEC serogroups occur in persons of poor socioeconomic status in three Brazilian cities; we also compared these strains' genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Although these strains occurred in 5% to 6% of the populations studied, including nondiarrheic children (in São Paulo and Ribeirão Preto), 73%–88% of them were dissociated from other well-established enteropathogens.

Although O51:H40 was the most frequent serotype found and occurred in all three areas studied, the non-EPEC eae+ EAF– stx– strains comprised a large variety of serotypes, and many were O nontypable. Moreover, the strains had diverse adherence patterns and various combinations of pathogenic E. coli DNA virulence sequences; the prevalence of these properties varied among the areas studied. Altogether, these data show that eae+ EAF– stx– E. coli strains outside the EPEC serogroups are even more diverse than already observed. As we have emphasized previously, such diversity challenges the diagnosis of these putative pathogens.

All strains carried an apparently complete LEE region, and approximately 75% of them had the potential to promote attaching and effacing lesions in HeLa cells, as detected by FAS. Thus at least these FAS+ strains are potentially enteropathogenic, since they are capable of inducing attaching and effacing lesions in vitro and may occur in diarrheic patients of various ages and in patients with AIDS.

### Molecular mechanisms of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection [^115ygX13]. Microbes and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness in developing countries and the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. ETEC constitute a diverse pathotype that elaborates heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins. Recent molecular pathogenesis studies reveal sophisticated pathogen-host interactions that might be exploited in efforts to prevent these important infections. While vaccine development for these pathogens remains a formidable challenge, extensive efforts are currently ongoing to exploit new genomic and proteomic technology platforms in the discovery of novel targets.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^116PfkuA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diarrheal infections are a common health problem globally, affecting individuals both in the United States and those traveling to developing countries. Multiple modalities, including antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, have been used to address these infections. Information on treatment, prevention, diagnostics, and the consequences of acute diarrhea infections has emerged, which helps to inform clinical management. In this ACG clinical guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute diarrhea infections in both U.S.-based and travel settings.

### Why antibiotics should not be used to treat Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^116MgTtt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

There has been much debate about treating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections with antibiotics. No data convincingly demonstrate that antibiotics are better than no antibiotic treatment at all, and many studies suggest antibiotics increase the risk of developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This topic is timely because emerging technology enables rapid identification of STEC-infected patients, and we anticipate questions about management will increase. This review is designed to familiarize readers with the series of observations that underlie our recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: The long debate over antibiotics in STEC infections appears resolved by gradually accruing information that shows antibiotics do not benefit infected patients. In fact, they are associated with an increased likelihood of developing HUS. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that low-risk-of-bias studies find a clear association between antibiotic use and the development of HUS. Subsequent publications do not refute these findings.

- **Summary**: In high-income countries, antibiotics should not routinely be given to patients with acute diarrhea unless testing demonstrates a pathogen for which antibiotics are indicated, and STEC infection has been excluded. Future work to prevent HUS should focus on preventing primary infections and mitigating extraintestinal consequences of STEC gut infections.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^113cAfWP]. Emerging infectious diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The EAF plasmid is not essential for the formation of A/E lesions, although its presence enhances their efficiency, probably through the influence of a cluster of plasmid-borne regulatory genes (per A, B, C) that increase expression of the chromosomal LEE genes. Evidence also indicates that BFP plays a role in host cell adhesion that would similarly increase the efficiency of A/E lesion formation.

In 1995, during the Second International Symposium on EPEC in São Paulo, most participants accepted the following EPEC definition: "EPEC are diarrheogenic Escherichia coli that produce a characteristic histopathology known as attaching and effacing (A/E) on intestinal cells and that do not produce Shiga, Shiga-like, or verocytotoxins. Typical EPEC of human origin possess a virulence plasmid known as the EAF (EPEC adherence factor) plasmid that encodes localized adherence on cultured epithelial cells mediated by the BFP, while atypical EPEC do not possess this plasmid. The majority of typical EPEC strains fall into certain well-recognized O:H serotypes". According to this definition, the basic difference between typical and atypical EPEC is the presence of the EAF plasmid in the first group of organisms and its absence in the second.

The most studied EPEC strains belong to a series of O antigenic groups known as EPEC O serogroups. Twelve EPEC serogroups were recognized by the World Health Organization in 1987: O26, O55, O86, O111, O114, O119, O125, O126, O127, O128, O142, and O158. These serogroups include both typical and atypical EPEC strains, as well as other diarrheogenic Escherichia coli.

### Comparative analyses of phenotypic and genotypic methods for detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli toxins and colonization factors [^113iFo7d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the main causes of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and in travelers. However, this pathogen is often not reported in surveys of diarrheal pathogens due to the lack of simple standardized methods for detecting ETEC in many laboratories. ETEC expresses one or both of two different enterotoxin subtypes: heat-stable toxins and a heat-labile toxin (LT), along with more than 22 different colonization factors (CFs) that mediate adherence to the intestinal cell wall.

We compare established phenotypic and genotypic detection methods with newly developed PCR detection methods, assessing sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and ease of performance. The methods include:

- **Phenotypic detection**: GM1-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dot blot techniques using specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for detecting the toxins and CFs.
- **Genotypic detection**: Different PCR and DNA/DNA hybridization techniques, including new PCR assays, for the identification of the toxin and CF genes.

We found very good general agreement in results derived from genotypic and phenotypic methods. In a few strains, LT and CFs were identified genetically but not phenotypically. Based on our analyses, initial screening for ETEC in clinical samples is recommended by multiplex toxin gene PCR. Toxin-positive strains may then be analyzed by dot blot tests for detection of the CFs expressed on the bacterial surface and by PCR for determination of additional CFs for which MAbs are currently lacking, as well as for strains that harbor silent genes.

### A method for fast and simple detection of major diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in the routine diagnostic laboratory [^115UF5g2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

A multiplex PCR was developed for the detection of the following genes characteristic of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC): verocytotoxins 1 (vtx1) and 2 (vtx2), characteristic of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC); intimin (eae), found in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), attaching and effacing E. coli and VTEC; heat-stable enterotoxin (estA) and heat-labile enterotoxin (eltA), characteristic of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC); and invasive plasmid antigen (ipaH), characteristic of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shigella spp. The method allowed the simultaneous identification of all six genes in one reaction and included a 16S rDNA internal PCR control. When applied to pure cultures from a reference strain collection, all virulence genes in 124 different DEC strains and 15 Shigella spp. were identified correctly, and there were no cross-reactions with 13 non-E. coli species. The detection limit of the method was 10²-10³ DEC CFU/PCR in the presence of 10⁶ non-target cells. When the multiplex PCR was tested with colonies from plate cultures of clinical stool samples, it was a faster, more sensitive, less expensive, and less laborious diagnostic procedure than DNA hybridisation. When used with DNA purified from spiked stool samples (by two different commercial kits), the method had a detection limit of 10⁶ CFU/mL stool sample.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: A modelling analysis [^1157qUH5]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

- **Research in context**: We used two search strings for the literature review: one for the aetiology in children younger than 5 years and another for diarrhoea and stunting. Firstly, we searched PubMed for articles published between Oct 29, 2010, and Oct 29, 2015, without language or publication restrictions by location. We found 59 results for "aetiology under five" with the search string ("ETEC" OR "enterotoxigenic E coli" OR "enterotoxigenic" OR "Shigella") AND ("children under five" OR "children under 5" OR "children < 5") AND ("morbidity" OR "illness" OR "stunting" OR "episodes" OR "events" OR "cases") AND ("cause" OR "etiology" OR "aetiology").

Secondly, we searched PubMed for articles published between inception and Oct 29, 2015, without language or publication restrictions by location. We found 129 results for "diarrhoea and stunting" with the search string ("diarrhea" OR "diarrea" OR "diarrhoea") AND ("stunting" OR "height for age" OR "height" OR "Z score") AND ("child" OR "children under five" OR "children under 5" OR "children < 5") AND ("outcomes" OR "changes"). From the articles identified, we selected the most relevant peer-reviewed journal articles on the subject of ETEC and Shigella deaths in children under 5 years of age, incidence, and the association of stunting and diarrhoea.

No publications systematically attempted to quantify the burden of ETEC and Shigella diarrhoea together with associated ETEC- and Shigella-induced stunting and resulting deaths from other infectious diseases. The Global Burden of Disease study has produced estimate.

### Association of enteropathogen detection with diarrhoea by age and high versus low child mortality settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tfze5]. The Lancet Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Literature from January 1, 1990, to July 9, 2019, was compiled from Embase, Cochrane, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases. The search terms were set as follows: (diarrh* OR gastroenteritis OR enteric infection*) AND (aeromonas OR entamoeba OR cryptosporidium OR giardia lamblia OR adenovir* OR astrovir* OR sapovirus OR norovirus OR rotavirus OR Escherichia coli OR etec OR epec OR E. coli OR cholera* OR campylobacter OR shigell* OR salmonell*). These terms were used to identify studies quantifying the association between enteropathogens and diarrhoea.

Studies were included if they were case-control or cohort in design and examined at least one enteropathogen of interest with diarrhoea as the outcome. Articles were limited to those published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese. Studies were excluded if they did not report on non-diarrhoeal controls; included participants with a broad case definition of gastroenteritis, preventing determination if all cases had diarrhoea; were limited to nosocomial infections; or were conducted solely among patients with underlying chronic conditions (except HIV). Additional details on inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the appendix (p. 1).

### Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: Foe or innocent bystander [^116UrcTL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) remains one of the most important pathogens infecting children, being one of the main causes of persistent diarrhea worldwide. Historically, typical EPEC (tEPEC), defined as those isolates with the attaching and effacement (A/E) genotype (eae(+)), which possess bfpA(+) and lack the stx(-) genes, have been strongly associated with diarrheal cases. However, the occurrence of atypical EPEC (aEPEC; eae(+)bfpA(-)stx(-)) in both diarrheal and asymptomatic hosts has led investigators to question the role of these pathogens in human disease. Epidemiological data are helping to answer whether EPEC is mainly a foe or an innocent bystander during infection.

### Single multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect diverse loci associated with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli [^1155DtMC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We developed and tested a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli. This PCR is specific, sensitive, and rapid in detecting target isolates in stool and food. Because of its simplicity, economy, and efficiency, this protocol warrants further evaluation in large, prospective studies of polymicrobial substances.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^117QhNsB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Characteristics of ETEC- and EPEC-positive MSD children are examined in detail. ETEC- and EPEC-infected children, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, showed nearly similar distribution across different age groups (0–11 months, 12–23 months, and 24–59 months), genders, and breastfeeding statuses [Tables 1 and 2]. ETEC-positive MSD was predominantly observed in children aged 0–11 months and 12–23 months, with about 40% in each age group, whereas EPEC-positive MSD was primarily found in the 0–11 months age group (49%). Girls (43%) were less susceptible to ETEC and EPEC MSD compared to boys.

At the time of enrollment, children with ETEC-positive MSD manifested more severe key clinical features than ETEC-negative MSD children, exhibiting symptoms such as sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, vomiting, and a need for IV rehydration therapy. EPEC-positive MSD children also experienced loss of skin turgor and required IV rehydration more frequently than EPEC-negative MSD children. Blood in stool and fever were more often observed in ETEC-negative MSD children than in ETEC-positive ones.

Mothers of ETEC- and EPEC-negative children were generally more literate compared to those of positive MSD children, and their drinking water source was often a tube well. The use of treated water was higher among ETEC-positive than negative MSD children. Handwashing practices varied; less handwashing after defecation and before cooking was seen among caregivers of ETEC-positive MSD children compared to ETEC-negative, but the reverse was true for handwashing after cleaning a child who defecated. Campylobacter was a common co-pathogen identified in ETEC-positive MSD children (P < 0.001), whereas Aeromonas and Shigella were more frequently observed as co-pathogens in ETEC-negative children.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: A modelling analysis [^117UHEJb]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella are two major pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years. Diarrhoea is associated with an increased risk of stunting, which puts children at risk of death due to other infectious diseases.

- **Methods**: We modelled ETEC-related and Shigella-related mortality and the effect of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea episodes to determine the number of children with stunting due to these infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries. We applied population attributable risk for increased number of deaths due to other infectious diseases in children who are stunted. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.

- **Findings**: In children younger than 5 years, we estimate 196 million (95% UI 135–269) episodes of ETEC and Shigella diarrhoea occur annually, resulting in 3.5 million (0.8–5.4) cases of moderate-to-severe stunting and 44,400 (29,400–59,800) total ETEC deaths and 63,100 (44,000–81,900) total Shigella deaths in 2015. Additional infectious disease mortality due to stunting resulted in increases of 24% (8–34; for ETEC) and 28% (10–39; for Shigella) over direct deaths due to diarrhoeal episodes. The distribution of mortality and morbidity varied geographically, with African Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region countries bearing the greatest burden.

- **Interpretation**: The expanded effects of non-fatal ETEC and Shigella-related diarrhoeal episodes can have lasting consequences. Prevention of these infections could reduce the risk of direct and indirect effects significantly.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^113Xmu2W]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains differ in several characteristics. Typical EPEC, a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, is rare in industrialized countries, where atypical EPEC seems to be a more important cause of diarrhea. For typical EPEC, the only reservoir is humans; whereas for atypical EPEC, both animals and humans can be reservoirs. Typical and atypical EPEC also differ in genetic characteristics, serotypes, and virulence properties. Atypical EPEC is more closely related to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and like STEC, these strains appear to be emerging pathogens.

### Rapid identification and differentiation of clinical isolates of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), atypical EPEC, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli by a one-step multiplex PCR method [^113AQapF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli, and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli differ in their virulence factor profiles, clinical manifestations, and prognosis, and they require different therapeutic measures. We developed and evaluated a robust multiplex PCR to identify these pathogroups based on sequences complementary to escV, bfpB, stx1, and stx2.
