## Question

hemoglobin of 12.2, hematocrit of 38, platelet of 137, other blood work normal in 78 M. Possible differentials and work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate a 78-year-old man with Hb 12.2 g/dL, Hct 38%, platelets 137 × 10⁹/L, and otherwise normal labs, including how to structure history, work-up, thresholds for marrow evaluation, and the differential diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these numbers meet accepted definitions of anemia and how to frame the concurrent mild thrombocytopenia. Then, I should verify the targeted history and medication review that could explain two-lineage cytopenias. Next, I will outline the initial laboratory evaluation and how I would interpret common patterns. After that, I need to decide when bone-marrow examination and molecular testing are indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and an initial monitoring and management plan, making sure to check for red flags and trajectory over time [^116SofJW] [^113HMPXu] [^113hDmon].

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I do not jump to conclusions. In adult males, anemia is defined as Hb < 13.0 g/dL, so an Hb of 12.2 g/dL qualifies as mild anemia; the hematocrit of 38% is concordant with that degree of reduction, and platelets of 137 × 10⁹/L represent mild thrombocytopenia in most laboratories, creating a two-lineage cytopenia rather than an isolated anemia, which nudges me to consider bone-marrow or systemic inflammatory processes if common reversible causes are not found [^116SofJW] [^113hDmon] [^113HMPXu].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements I must not miss, since in older adults subtle clues often direct testing. I need to check chronicity and trend of Hb and platelets, overt or occult bleeding history, constitutional symptoms, and comorbid conditions such as CKD, liver disease, thyroid disease, or malignancy; I should review medications with hematologic toxicity profiles including alkylators like busulfan, antiepileptics like levetiracetam, antipsychotics such as quetiapine, and drugs associated with hemolysis like methyldopa, while also asking about alcohol, nutritional risk, and family history of hematologic disease [^113HMPXu] [^111aW8pw] [^112EaZ1D] [^112Kjob6] [^114xQpfX].

> Hold on, I should verify the first-line laboratory evaluation before assuming anything exotic. I will repeat a CBC with differential and indices, obtain a reticulocyte count or index and a careful peripheral smear to look for dysplasia or blasts, then check iron studies with ferritin, transferrin saturation, TIBC and CRP, plus vitamin B12 and folate, renal function, liver enzymes, and TSH; in indeterminate iron profiles, I should consider a soluble transferrin receptor, and if iron deficiency is confirmed in an older man, I need to plan gastrointestinal evaluation for occult blood loss with stool testing and age-appropriate endoscopy given cancer risk [^113o4F2T] [^112qcPhA] [^113hDmon] [^116SofJW] [^1156qyBS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, for hemolysis assessment I initially thought it was unlikely with normal platelets, but I should correct myself because the platelets here are mildly low at 137 × 10⁹/L and that does not exclude hemolysis; if clinical or laboratory clues suggest hemolysis, I need LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a Coombs test, while the smear may show schistocytes or spherocytes depending on mechanism, so I should not dismiss this pathway prematurely [^113hDmon].

> If the initial evaluation does not reveal a cause, I need to consider bone-marrow evaluation, but let me first confirm the thresholds. In an older adult with persistent two-lineage cytopenias, dysplastic features on smear, or a downward trend, referral for marrow aspiration and biopsy is appropriate; I should request cytogenetics and a myeloid NGS panel to assess for clonal hematopoiesis or MDS, include flow cytometry to exclude marrow infiltrative or lymphoid processes, and use iron staining if iron indices are discordant, since missing MDS or clonal cytopenia would be a key error here [^115B3gQo] [^113HMPXu] [^115mbRkn].

> Let me think through the differential in order of likelihood while I keep checking for inconsistencies. Anemia of chronic inflammation remains common in normocytic patterns, though I need corroborating inflammatory markers; iron deficiency from occult gastrointestinal blood loss must be actively excluded in an older man if ferritin or transferrin saturation are low; early CKD-related anemia can present with normocytic indices even before overt uremia; myelodysplastic syndrome is suggested by two-lineage cytopenias, macrocytosis, dysplasia on smear, low reticulocyte index, and clonal mutations; finally, drug-induced cytopenias and marrow suppression need to be revisited if temporal relationships fit, and nutritional deficiencies or endocrine causes should be ruled out systematically [^113hDmon] [^1156qyBS] [^116SofJW] [^113HMPXu].

> I should confirm an initial management and monitoring plan that aligns with guideline targets while avoiding over-treatment. There is no role for transfusion at this Hb unless symptomatic or there are special circumstances, so the priority is to correct identified reversible causes, treat iron deficiency if present and pursue GI evaluation, optimize comorbidities, and if CKD-related anemia is suspected, individualize ESA decisions, avoiding maintenance of Hb above 11.5 g/dL and never targeting above 13 g/dL, with hemoglobin monitoring at guideline intervals by CKD stage [^117Xp2Gv] [^114wzHmw] [^112H9r36] [^11529EC7].

> I need to ensure a safety net with clear red flags and follow-up cadence. A falling Hb or platelet trajectory, appearance of leukopenia, abnormal smear morphology, B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly should prompt expedited hematology referral and marrow evaluation, whereas stable, mild cytopenias with an identified benign cause can be monitored with periodic counts while addressing the underlying condition and medication contributors [^115B3gQo] [^113HMPXu].

> But wait, what if this is a slow age-related drift in hemoglobin rather than a new pathologic process; let me reconsider in that context. While modest Hb decline over many years can occur in older adults, the concurrent mild thrombocytopenia is not typical of isolated age-related change, so I should still complete the structured evaluation rather than attributing this to "anemia of aging" prematurely [^117KoYiR].

The most likely causes of mild anemia with borderline thrombocytopenia in a 78-year-old man are **anemia of chronic disease** or **early myelodysplastic syndrome** [^113hDmon] [^113HMPXu]. Initial workup should include **CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, iron studies, B12/folate, TSH, renal and liver function tests, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP)** [^113o4F2T]. If these are inconclusive, proceed to **bone marrow biopsy** and cytogenetics to evaluate for MDS or other marrow disorders [^113HMPXu]. Additional evaluation for occult GI bleeding [^1156qyBS], hemolysis [^111Y5frp], and medication review [^112EaZ1D] is recommended.

## Differential diagnosis

### Anemia

- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Common in elderly patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, malignancies, or chronic infections [^113hDmon].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced erythropoietin production leading to normocytic anemia [^113hDmon] [^116SofJW].

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Common in elderly, presenting with mild anemia and thrombocytopenia [^113HMPXu].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency can cause mild anemia [^1156qyBS].

- **Occult gastrointestinal bleeding**: Common in elderly, often due to malignancy or peptic ulcer disease [^1156qyBS].

- **Medication-induced anemia**: NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or chemotherapeutic agents [^112EaZ1D].

---

### Thrombocytopenia

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Common cause of mild thrombocytopenia in elderly [^113HMPXu].

- **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: Autoimmune destruction of platelets [^111xP5Zj].

- **Medication-induced thrombocytopenia**: Heparin, quinine, antibiotics, antiepileptics [^112EaZ1D] [^1113VnmU].

- **Alcohol use**: Chronic alcohol consumption can cause mild thrombocytopenia.

- **Liver disease**: Portal hypertension and splenomegaly causing platelet sequestration.

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

### Initial laboratory evaluation

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and red cell indices**: Evaluate MCV, MCH, RDW [^113o4F2T].

- **Reticulocyte count**: Assess bone marrow response [^113o4F2T].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate morphology, dysplasia, blasts, schistocytes [^113HMPXu].

- **Iron studies**: Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, TIBC [^112qcPhA].

- **Vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Rule out nutritional deficiencies [^113o4F2T].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR [^116SofJW].

- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin.

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH, free T4 [^113hDmon].

- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR, CRP [^113o4F2T].

- **Hemolysis markers**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, Coombs test.

---

### Additional investigations based on initial results

Consider **bone marrow biopsy** when MDS or marrow infiltration is suspected [^113HMPXu], and pursue **gastrointestinal evaluation** (fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy, and upper endoscopy) if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected [^1156qyBS]. **Imaging** with abdominal ultrasound or CT should be considered when organomegaly or malignancy is a concern, and a **medication review** should be performed to identify potential drug-induced cytopenias [^112EaZ1D].

---

## Clinical significance and management considerations

Anemia in the elderly is associated with **increased morbidity, mortality, cognitive decline, and functional impairment** [^11426WUb]. Thrombocytopenia increases **bleeding risk**, particularly as platelet counts decline [^111fhkxR]. Management depends on the **underlying cause** and includes treating nutritional deficiencies [^1156qyBS], managing chronic diseases, discontinuing offending medications [^112EaZ1D], and considering hematology referral if MDS or malignancy is suspected [^113HMPXu].

## References

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation.

- **Focused history**: A detailed history should be taken to assess for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (e.g. antiplatelet or anticoagulants), major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption, and personal or family history of anemia. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

- **Laboratory evaluation**: In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed, including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review. The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and leukemia disorders.

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem that is often discovered through routine laboratory tests. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians. The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary.

The evaluation begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include the red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear. Further testing is guided by the results of these studies. Treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying cause of the anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^111zjJc5]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for methemoglobinemia, more specifically with respect to methemoglobin levels, EHA/ERN-EuroBloodNet 2021 guidelines recommend measuring venous blood methemoglobin levels in all symptomatic patients.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of anemia in the elective surgical patient [^1172QHmS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of anemia in elective surgical patients may be as frequent as 75% in certain populations. A national audit demonstrated that 35% of patients scheduled for joint replacement therapy have a hemoglobin level of < 13 g/dL on preadmission testing. Standard practice currently consists of preadmission testing 3 to 7 days before an elective operative procedure, precluding the opportunity to effectively evaluate and manage a patient with unexpected anemia. Therefore, a standardized approach for the detection, evaluation, and management of anemia in the preoperative surgical setting was identified as an unmet medical need.

To address this knowledge gap, a panel of physicians was convened to develop a clinical care pathway for anemia management in this setting. Elective surgery patients should receive a hemoglobin (Hgb) determination at least 30 days before the scheduled surgical procedure. Because the identification and evaluation of anemia will assist in the expedited diagnosis and treatment of underlying comorbidities and improve patient outcomes, unexplained anemia (Hgb < 12 g/dL for females and < 13 g/dL for males) should cause elective surgery to be deferred until an evaluation can be performed.

### Myleran [^111aW8pw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

It is recommended that evaluation of hemoglobin or hematocrit, total white blood cell count and differential count, and quantitative platelet count be obtained weekly while the patient is on busulfan therapy. In cases where the cause of fluctuation in the formed elements of the peripheral blood is obscure, a bone marrow examination may be useful for evaluating marrow status. A decision to increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue a given dose of busulfan must be based not only on the absolute hematologic values but also on the rapidity with which changes are occurring. The dosage of busulfan may need to be reduced if this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary toxicity is myelosuppression. Occasionally, patients may be unusually sensitive to busulfan administered at standard dosage and suffer neutropenia or thrombocytopenia following a relatively short exposure to the drug. Busulfan should not be used where facilities for complete blood counts, including quantitative platelet counts, are not available at weekly or more frequent intervals.

- **Drug interactions**: Busulfan may cause additive myelosuppression when used with other myelosuppressive drugs. In one study, 12 of approximately 330 patients receiving continuous busulfan and thioguanine therapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia were found to have portal hypertension and esophageal varices associated with abnormal liver function tests. Subsequent liver biopsies were performed in 4 of these patients, all of which showed evidence of nodular regenerative hyperplasia.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112qcPhA]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically concerning the evaluation of anemia, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an anemia workup if the hemoglobin level is below normal. This workup should include at least the following red blood cell (RBC) indices: red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

- **Extended workup**: In a more extensive workup, include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Anemia in type 2 diabetic patients and correlation with kidney function in a tertiary care sub-Saharan African hospital: a cross-sectional study [^115DpqQf]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were 13.2 ± 2.0 g/dl in males and 12.3 ± 1.5 g/dl in females (p < 0.001). According to the WHO criteria, 263 patients (41.4%) had anemia, with a prevalence of 42.6% in females (n = 127) and 40.2% in males (n = 136). Using the threshold recommended for intervention (Hb < 11 g/dl for both sexes), 91 patients (14.3%), including 48 females (prevalence 16.1%) and 43 males (prevalence 12.7%), had anemia.

The average mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the total population was 86.3 ± 7.7 fl. The difference in the distribution of mean corpuscular volume categories between patients with anemia and those without anemia was significant (p < 0.001), with anemic patients having more microcytosis and macrocytosis than non-anemic patients. The average mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was 32.4 ± 2.7 in the total population. Low MCHC was more common in anemic than non-anemic participants, 103 (47.3%) and 100 (38.3%) respectively (p = 0.05).

### Inrebic [^1113VnmU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment with INREBIC can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.

- **Anemia**: New or worsening Grade 3 anemia occurred in 34% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 anemia was approximately 2 months, with 75% of these cases occurring within 3 months. Mean hemoglobin levels reached nadir after 12 to 16 weeks, with partial recovery and stabilization after 16 weeks. Red blood cell transfusions were received by 51% of INREBIC-treated patients, and permanent discontinuation of INREBIC occurred due to anemia in 1% of patients. Consider dose reduction for patients who become red blood cell transfusion-dependent [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: New or worsening Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia during the randomized treatment period occurred in 12% of INREBIC-treated patients. The median time to onset of the first Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was approximately 1 month, with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Platelet transfusions were received by 3.1% of INREBIC-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation of treatment due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding that required clinical intervention both occurred in 2.1% of INREBIC-treated patients.

Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, interrupt INREBIC until resolved to less than or equal to Grade 2 or baseline. Restart the dose at 100 mg daily below the last given dose and monitor platelets as clinically indicated.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to pediatric and adult hematology practices. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases will be acquired, especially in adult patients, but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems.

The first step is defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, which can be as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision to pursue additional studies is made, the increasing number of laboratory tests available can make the diagnostic process complex.

In this article, we present two clinical vignettes as an introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We outline a general method for evaluating patients with suspected inherited platelet disorders, describe the rationale for the different types of clinically available tests, their limitations, and the challenges frequently encountered in interpreting results. We also provide guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of the severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide practicing hematologists with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with travel-associated severe malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013 [^115EKWzf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Severe malaria is defined as malaria in persons with blood smears positive for asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum parasites and at least one criterion of severity according to the definition of severe malaria used in France. Patients with mixed-species infections are excluded from the analysis.

Anemia is defined as a blood hemoglobin level of 390 IU/L (reference value 190–390 IU/L). Three patterns of anemia are described: PADH, non-PADH, and indeterminate.

- **Padh pattern**: Defined by a new drop in the hemoglobin level after day 8 of treatment initiation and the appearance or reappearance of hemolytic markers (> 10% drop in hemoglobin or > 10% rise in LDH levels) occurring any time between day 8 and the end of follow-up. It may also include any information in the medical chart referring to acute hemolysis occurring after day 8.

- **Non-PADH pattern**: Defined by a hemoglobin nadir and a hemolysis peak occurring before day 8, with or without positive markers of hemolysis after day 8 and without a nadir or sudden drop of hemoglobin after day 8 as defined for the PADH pattern.

- **Indeterminate pattern**: Includes all other cases of anemia for which information is lacking or with an evolution pattern that does not fit the other patterns.

### Society of family planning clinical recommendation: Management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^112oNend]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

The Society of Family Planning 2024 guidelines emphasize the importance of pre-abortion evaluations. Specifically, they recommend obtaining a preoperative hemoglobin or hematocrit level in patients undergoing later abortion. This assessment is crucial to appropriately manage and respond to blood loss situations.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) for the diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leucocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to examine the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help identify the various causes of anemia.

- **Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count**: In clinical practice, it should be considered that multiple causes of anemia may be present in one patient. For instance, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. Drug-induced anemia, such as that caused by treatment with azathioprine, can lead to lab tests showing microcytic or even macrocytic anemia. This demonstrates that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in IDA but remain normal in ACD. The RDW indicates how much erythrocytes vary in size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within the normal range in thalassemia.

### Levetiracetam [^112EaZ1D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, reinfections, or coagulation disorders.

- **Partial-onset seizures**: In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 x 10^6/mm^3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%) were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

	- A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 x 10^9/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 x 10^9/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^116vjNHY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition characterized by lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is commonly observed in patients already experiencing bone marrow depression and may thus become a comorbidity. Due to the requirement for several different types of chemical agents for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of tests, perhaps 50–60 mL. Frequently, local and reference laboratories request larger samples than necessary to perform a given test and have some left for any required repeat testing. Based on my experience, a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis in childhood [^115Wnv3A]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The investigations revealed the following results:

- **Complete blood count**: On admission, the results were suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia.
	- Haemoglobin: 40 g/L.
	- Total red blood cell count: 2.57 × 10¹²/L (normal range: 4–5.2 × 10¹²/L).
	- Haematocrit: 16.3% (normal range: 35–45%).
	- Red blood cell indices:
		- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 63.4 fL (normal range: 77–95).
		- Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH): 15.6 pg (normal range: 25–33).
		- Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC): 24.5 g/dL (normal range: 31–37).
		- Red cell distribution width (RDW): 47.6 fL (normal range: 11.6–14).
	- Total leucocyte count: 14.27 × 10⁹/L.
	- Differential leucocyte count:
		- Neutrophil: 65.8%.
		- Lymphocyte: 26.5%.
		- Eosinophil: 0.8%.
		- Monocyte: 5.8%.
		- Basophil: 1.1%.

- **Interpretation**: The complete blood count with elevated RDW and decreased MCV, MCH, and MCHC was suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia.

- **Urine routine examination**: This was within normal limits.

- **Peripheral smear examination**: Red blood cells exhibited severe anisopoikilocytosis with frequent microcytes and hypochromic cells. Leptocytes were frequent.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112RwYCQ]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, IBD, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia workup. This workup should include at least RBC indices, such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration, in patients with low hemoglobin levels. Include serum vitamin B12 measurement in a more extensive workup.

### Not so benign haematology: Anaemia of the elderly [^117KoYiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a demographic shift resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65 years of age that our health systems have ever encountered. Consequently, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complex patient population, yet sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps to ensure the best care for this population include determining appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities. Additionally, interventional trials need to be developed that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets. Furthermore, translational studies should focus on the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults, employing the most advanced scientific approaches.

### A 34-year-old man with a neck mass [^113rJb7H]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratory and radiology findings revealed hemoglobin was 13.6 g/dL, WBC count 5,400/μL, platelets 320,000/μL, and CD4 count was 594 cells/μL. Creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. The serum venereal disease research laboratory test was negative. Although the services were available at the hospital, blood culture and erythrocyte sedimentation rate tests were not requested. Additional blood tests, such as C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, and Epstein-Barr virus viral load, were not available, and the patient was unable to afford these tests elsewhere.

The results of the ECG were normal. A Doppler ultrasound scan of the right neck mass showed a 6 cm × 6 cm pseudoaneurysm with a clot in the lumen. A chest radiograph indicated a left paratracheal mass in the superior mediastinum causing tracheal deviation to the right. The lung fields were normal, and no other chest pathology was noted on the radiograph (Fig 1).

Figure 1 demonstrates the chest radiograph showing a superior mediastinal mass (arrows) and tracheal deviation.

A non-contrast MRI scan of the neck and upper thorax revealed three large pseudoaneurysms. One was a right common carotid artery pseudoaneurysm, 6 cm in diameter, with extensive mural thrombus. Additionally, there were two intrathoracic pseudoaneurysms: a superior one, 6 cm wide, encircling the proximal left subclavian artery, and an inferior one, 4 cm wide, at the origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig 2).

Figure 2 shows the non-contrast MRI scan of the neck and upper thorax illustrating (A) right common carotid artery pseudoaneurysm, (B) proximal left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm, and (C).

### Association of hemoglobin concentration and its change with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [^114UVoVt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Several potential mechanisms could explain how low hemoglobin concentrations increase the risk of CVD-related and all-cause mortality. First, anemic status may result in ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Chronic anemia, with hemoglobin levels less than 13.0 g/dL, can lead to significant health problems. Conversely, smokers with elevated hemoglobin concentrations (greater than 16.0 g/dL) had a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality compared to smokers with normal hemoglobin concentrations.

### Monitoring of hematological and hemostatic parameters in neurocritical care patients [^114Y4AhS]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia and bleeding are paramount concerns in neurocritical care and often relate to the severity of intracranial hemorrhage. Anemia is generally associated with worse outcomes, and efforts to minimize anemia through reduced volume of blood sampled are encouraged. Point-of-care testing reliably detects the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen bleeding and reduce platelet activity, particularly in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

How best to monitor the effect of platelet transfusion or platelet-activating therapy is not well studied. For patients known to take novel oral anticoagulants, drug-specific coagulation tests before neurosurgical intervention are prudent.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: Implications for anemia [^1159rLSu]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

In practice, clinicians generally consider anemia (circulating hemoglobin concentration < 120 g/L in non-pregnant females and < 130 g/L in males) as due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis or increased erythrocyte loss or destruction. Rarely is a rise in plasma volume relative to circulating total hemoglobin mass considered as a cause. But does this matter? We explored this issue in patients by measuring hemoglobin concentration and total hemoglobin mass using the optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method, and thereby calculating plasma volume in healthy volunteers, surgical patients, and those with inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease, or heart failure.

We studied 109 participants. Hemoglobin mass correlated well with its concentration in the healthy, surgical, and inflammatory bowel disease groups (r = 0.687–0.871, P < 0.001). However, they were poorly related in liver disease (r = 0.410, P = 0.11) and heart failure patients (r = 0.312, P = 0.16). In these cases, hemoglobin mass explained little of the variance in its concentration (adjusted R² = 0.109 and 0.052; P = 0.11 and 0.16), whilst plasma volume did (R² change 0.724 and 0.805 in heart and liver disease respectively, P < 0.0001). Exemplar patients with identical (normal or raised) total hemoglobin masses were diagnosed as profoundly anemic (or not) depending on differences in plasma volume that had not been measured or even considered as a cause.

The traditional inference that anemia generally reflects hemoglobin deficiency may be misleading, potentially resulting in inappropriate tests and therapeutic interventions to address 'hem…

For this paper, cases reported formally and anecdotally to the authors in their screening and diagnostic roles have been selected to demonstrate areas where errors have occurred, and caution should be exercised. The cases demonstrate that it is vital that the performance and limitations of the techniques used, along with the phenotypic presentation of cases where haemoglobin variants and/or thalassaemias are coinherited, are understood by those performing result interpretation. Those who deliver the service, as well as those who receive reports and give results and counselling, should be aware of the complexity of the topic.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^113o4F2T]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, and more specifically with respect to the evaluation of anemia, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an anemia workup if the hemoglobin level is below normal. This workup should include at least red blood cell indices such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

To conduct a more extensive workup, include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, and haptoglobin; the percentage of hypochromic red cells; reticulocyte hemoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); soluble transferrin receptor; creatinine; and urea.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LZUAq]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 4.5 - Monitoring of treatment - resistance to ESA therapy**: We recommend that inadequate response ('resistance') to ESA therapy is defined as failure to reach the target Hb level despite SC epoetin dose > 300 IU/kg/week (450 IU/kg/week IV epoetin), or darbepoetin dose > 1.5 microgram/kg/week. Hyporesponsive patients who are iron replete should be screened clinically and by investigations for other common causes of anaemia.

- **Audit measure**: Prevalence of resistance to ESA among renal replacement therapy patients.

- **Rationale**: Extensive publications are available on the topic of resistance to ESA therapy, including the Revised European Best Practice Guidelines which define ESA resistance as above. Failure to respond at an earlier stage in therapy should, however, raise suspicion of ESA resistance. Comparison of the individual Hb outcome achieved and the dose of ESA used can provide a useful way of highlighting individuals that are ESA resistant during local unit audits. ESA therapy is efficacious in most patients. However, many conditions and treatment variables can cause or explain apparent resistance to ESA therapy. Adequate investigation and management of these underlying conditions are crucial in achieving satisfactory haemoglobin outcome values as well as requiring therapy in their own right.

- **Guideline 4.6 - Evaluation for ESA induced pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)**:

- We do not recommend routine screening for anti-erythropoietin antibodies among CKD patients regularly treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents.

- We recommend that the diagnosis of ESA induc…

### Emergency transfusions [^117HPxgJ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Successful emergency transfusions require early recognition and activation of resources to minimize treatment delays. The initial goals should focus on the replacement of blood in a balanced fashion. There is ongoing debate regarding the best approach to transfusions, with some advocating for resuscitation with a fixed ratio of blood products and others preferring the use of viscoelastic assays to guide transfusions. Whole-blood transfusion is also a debated strategy. Despite these different approaches, it is generally accepted that transfusions should be started early and that crystalloid infusions should be limited. As hemodynamic stability is restored, endpoints of resuscitation should be used to guide the resuscitation.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116HQZLa]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaemia of CKD (Guidelines 4.1–4.5) discusses the monitoring of treatment, particularly focusing on hemoglobin (Hb) levels during erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Guideline 4.1 suggests that Hb concentration should be monitored every 2–4 weeks during the correction phase and every 1–3 months for stable patients in the maintenance phase. More frequent monitoring will depend on clinical circumstances.

- **Rationale**: It is crucial to monitor Hb response to treatment closely to detect possible adverse events and to plan ESA dose modifications. More frequent Hb monitoring may be needed for patients with unstable Hb, Hb levels outside the target range, or for those anticipated to experience Hb drops due to blood loss, hemolysis, infection, or suboptimal dialysis. The response to ESA therapy varies widely among different patient groups and individuals within those groups. Additionally, an individual's response can significantly fluctuate depending on other clinical variables. During ESA initiation therapy and after drug dose adjustments or changes in a patient's clinical condition, more frequent monitoring is recommended to avoid under-treatment (persistent anemia) and overtreatment (rapidly rising Hb, hypertension, or polycythemia).

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: What is it? Why is it important [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates a disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count.

For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections. The reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Methyldopa [^114xQpfX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

It is important to recognize that a positive Coombs test, hemolytic anemia, and liver disorders may occur with methyldopa therapy. These rare occurrences could lead to potentially fatal complications unless properly recognized and managed. Careful attention is required to understand these reactions.

With prolonged methyldopa therapy, 10 to 20 percent of patients develop a positive direct Coombs test, usually occurring between 6 and 12 months of therapy. The lowest incidence is observed at a daily dosage of 1 g or less. On rare occasions, this may be associated with hemolytic anemia, which could lead to potentially fatal complications. It is not possible to predict which patients with a positive direct Coombs test will develop hemolytic anemia.

The existence or development of a positive direct Coombs test is not, in itself, a contraindication to the use of methyldopa. If a positive Coombs test develops, the physician should determine whether hemolytic anemia exists and whether the positive Coombs test could pose a problem. For example, in addition to a positive direct Coombs test, there is less frequently a positive indirect Coombs test, which may interfere with cross-matching of blood.

- **Monitoring and testing**: Before starting treatment, it is desirable to conduct a blood count (hematocrit, hemoglobin, or red cell count) to establish a baseline or determine the presence of anemia. Periodic blood counts should be performed during therapy to monitor for hemolytic anemia. It may be useful to perform a direct Coombs test before therapy and again at 6 and 12 months after the start of therapy.

### Higher hemoglobin level is associated with subtle declines in renal function and presence of cardiorenal risk factors in early CKD stages [^115t8qKQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced renal dysfunction have comorbidities, including anemia, as a consequence of reduced production of erythropoietin. However, little is known about the renal response to early decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before the onset of anemia. We therefore investigated the hemoglobin concentration across subtle declines in renal function stratified by cardiorenal risk factors, in subjects with eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Methods**: Based on the data from routine health checkups in tertiary university hospitals during the last 15 years, 145,865 adult subjects were identified.

- **Results**: Hemoglobin levels among eGFR Groups 2–6 (50 ≤ eGFR < 100 mL/min/1.73 m²) were significantly higher compared to eGFR group ≥ 100 mL/min/1.73 m² (P < 0.001), and the highest level of mean hemoglobin was seen at eGFR 50–59 mL/min/1.73 m². The mean hemoglobin level of subjects with eGFR 50–59 mL/min/1.73 m² and eGFR ≥ 100 mL/min/1.73 m² were 13.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.33–13.40] g/dL versus 12.92 (95% CI: 12.88–12.95) g/dL in women (P < 0.001); in men, 15.60 (95% CI: 15.57–15.63) g/dL versus 15.15 (95% CI: 15.11–15.18) g/dL (P < 0.001). Among each eGFR group, hemoglobin levels were higher in subjects with hypertension (P < 0.001 in both genders), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001 in both genders), and components of metabolic syndrome (P < 0.003 in both genders) compared to subjects without these conditions.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoglobin concentration may be slightly higher across subtle declines in renal function and the presence of cardiorenal risk factors in early CKD stages.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: Implications for anemia [^113VvGk4]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit in all patients, categorized by plasma volume status. Plasma volume contraction (n = 3) was classified as greater than 8% below expected norms. Normal plasma volume (PV) (n = 24) was classified as derived PV within ± 8% of the expected normal volume on an individual level. Mild to moderate volume expansion (n = 36) was considered as 8% to 25% above the expected normal volume. Significant differences were observed in hemoglobin concentration: ✱ p = 0.005 for [Hb] in severe PV expansion vs. mild to moderate, †P < 0.0001 for [Hb] in severe PV expansion vs. normal PV. Data is expressed as mean (± standard deviation error bars). PV refers to plasma volume; [Hb] denotes hemoglobin concentration (g.L−1); Hct (%) indicates hematocrit percentage.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, specifically in the management of preoperative anemia, assessment, and timing of surgery, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering referral for patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency. This referral should be based on the severity of anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels less than 120 g/L for males and less than 100 g/L for females, or in accordance with locally agreed criteria. Recognizing that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to anemia severity is crucial.

### Anemia is a new complication in Fabry disease: Data from the Fabry Outcome Survey [^117Ep8Ua]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence and causes of anemia among patients with Fabry disease are unknown.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, we examined hemoglobin concentrations of patients with Fabry disease using a large international database, the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS). We analyzed the association of renal function, heart failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, and inflammation with anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL for women and < 13 g/dL for men).

- **Results**: Decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [≤ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] and anemia, heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV], and/or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were documented in 82% of patients. Up to 67% of patients with decreased estimated GFR presented with anemia. There was also a trend for lower hemoglobin levels among patients with signs of inflammation (defined by an elevated CRP level). We observed no association of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms with anemia. Analyses in 53 patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy for up to 2 years suggest no effect on anemia.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study point to a high prevalence of anemia among patients with Fabry disease that is, in most instances, related to impaired renal function, heart failure, and inflammation. This finding may be of clinical importance.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for several adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Questions about what constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^114JCsrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit.

The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" iron deficiency anemia (IDA) cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate iron deficiency (ID), as the presence of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

- **Iron stores**: Serum ferritin.
- **Iron transport**: Transferrin saturation.
- **Iron utilization**: Erythropoiesis, i.e. the proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes.

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be affected by various external factors.

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: A measured response to a critical review [^1175zjQv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

In a systematic evaluation of 450 studies and 494 clinical scenarios, investigators reported that: "Decisions to transfuse RBCs are often based on unsubstantiated Hb level or hematocrit 'triggers'". The authors concluded that 59% of transfusions actually reduced "well-being", defined as the health of the transfusion recipient (and therefore were considered inappropriate), and 29% had no benefit.

Clinicians are even less aware of the costs of blood transfusions than the potential risks. Although the acquisition cost of a unit of blood varies between $200 and $250 in most hospitals, activity-based costing that considers all of the other costs associated with administering blood reveals a total cost between $522 and $1,183 per unit, and probably more when adjusted for inflation and other factors.

Given the risks and costs of RBC transfusions, there is a growing recognition of the need for strategies to reduce unnecessary transfusions. The American Medical Association's Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement and the Joint Commission, with participation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently identified RBC transfusions as one of the top five overused procedures in medicine. The Joint Commission has also introduced measures that track the appropriateness of RBC transfusion as a continuous quality indicator.

### Evaluating anemia using contrast-enhanced spectral detector CT of the chest in a large cohort of 522 patients [^112WnCgJ]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Quantitative image analysis was conducted using region of interest (ROI)-based quantitative image analysis in contrast-enhanced conventional images. A radiologist with one year of experience in thoracic imaging placed two ROIs in the left ventricle and one ROI in the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the left ventricle (Figure 2). ROIs were drawn as large as possible with a minimum diameter of 1 cm, avoiding the inclusion of surrounding tissues. These ROIs were then copied and pasted onto virtual non-contrast (VNC) reconstructions. For each ROI, attenuation and standard deviation (SD) were recorded, and all three ROIs were averaged for statistical testing.

- **Figure 2**: Placement of circular regions of interest in the left ventricle and the descending aorta is shown for a 42-year-old anemic male patient (serum hemoglobin 5.6 g/dl; upper row) and a 59-year-old healthy male patient (serum hemoglobin 14.5 g/dl; lower row) in contrast-enhanced portal venous phase scans (left) and the corresponding virtual non-contrast reconstructions (right). Notably, the "interventricular septum sign" is slightly visible in the virtual non-contrast reconstruction in the upper row.

For each patient, serum hemoglobin (HbS) levels were retrieved from the hospital information system. Only laboratory tests within ± 7 days of the SDCT exam were included. Three groups were defined according to the following HbS concentrations, as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines: male patients with HbS ≥ 13.0 g/dl and female patients with HbS ≥ 12.0 g/dl were considered healthy, while lower levels were categorized into mild/moderate and severe anemia groups.

### Approach to interpreting common laboratory pathology tests in transgender individuals [^116RdCYN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Androgens are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, while the impact of estrogens is not as well understood. In trans individuals who have been on established and full-dose feminizing hormone therapy (estradiol and anti-androgen) for at least six months, there is a significant decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the female reference range. Conversely, after six months of masculinizing testosterone therapy, trans individuals demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the male reference range. Serum hematocrit in the range of the affirmed gender is evident from three months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

Of note, there are association studies suggesting that higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This is probably a consideration for individuals using masculinizing hormone therapy, more so than those using feminizing hormone therapy. As smoking may additionally increase hematocrit, smoking cessation should be emphasized in those with elevated hematocrit. While the long-term cardiovascular implications of using a different reference range for hemoglobin or hematocrit are unclear in general, reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be used. Female reference ranges should be used for someone taking gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy, and male reference ranges should be used for individuals using masculinizing hormone therapy.

In trans women, there is a small statistically significant but clinically insignificant rise in platelet count, which remains within the normal range.

### Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: Improvement with blood glucose control [^116bKycw]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients, we undertook a retrospective review of medical records. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study.

In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 ± 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 ± 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 ± 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 ± 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 ± 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 ± 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 ± 1.7% (P < 0.001; confidence interval, 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 ± 0.9 g/dL (P < 0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 ± 1.9% (P < 0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control.

Some patients with new-onset diabetes showed these improvements, indicating a connection between glycemic control and anemia recovery.

A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in September 2012. At this time, he had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 41 × 10^9/L. The patient was in good condition with a hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL. However, a platelet count of 38 × 10^9/L indicated thrombocytopenia, although there were no symptoms of bleeding. The discrepancy between the almost normal hemoglobin and the low platelet count triggered diagnostics for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

No platelet-specific antibodies were found, but reticulated thrombocytes were clearly elevated at 30.24% (normal values are 2% to 9%). Thrombopoietin levels were within the normal range at 285 pg/mL (normal is > 150 pg/mL). These results, while not diagnostic, were compatible with increased platelet destruction. No anti-platelet antibodies were detected in the peripheral blood. A bone marrow biopsy specimen indicated nodular infiltration with CLL cells (20%), but normal-to-elevated thrombopoiesis compatible with CLL and ITP. According to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Guidelines, the patient was not treated for CLL in the absence of symptoms. The patient received 1 mg/kg of prednisolone for 3 days in preparation for surgery, and the platelet count increased to 101 × 10^9/L.

Two years later, the patient experienced a severe episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. The platelet count was 20 × 10^9/L with a WBC of 66 × 10^9/L. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed at this time because of the patient's preference. Therefore, treatment was initiated with 6 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (rituximab 375 mg/m^2; cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m^2; dexamethasone, 12 mg).

### Blood hemoglobin concentrations and the incidence of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease in patients undergoing hemodialysis: 10-year outcomes of the Q-Cohort Study [^112oKmWn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Some potential mechanisms may explain the association between anemia and PAD progression. One such mechanism may be that anemia often leads to hyperdynamic circulation, which modulates the inflammatory response to diseased arteries. Another mechanism may be that anemia results in less oxygen delivery to tissues and may cause hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions, leading to the promotion of PAD. Indeed, basic studies have shown that inflammasome activation is observed in the diseased arteries of patients with PAD. Further experimental studies are warranted to reveal the pathological role of anemia in PAD progression.

The optimal target range of blood hemoglobin concentration in patients receiving hemodialysis has been debated. Anemia correction by ESAs or other therapeutic options significantly decreases the incidence of blood transfusion, improves patients' quality of life, and increases physical vitality by increasing blood supply capacity. Experimental studies have confirmed that anemia correction by ESAs has diverse protective effects on clinically important outcomes. However, regarding hard end points, large-scale trials comparing two targets of low and high blood hemoglobin concentrations failed to show the superiority of targeting a high blood hemoglobin concentration among patients receiving hemodialysis. Instead, some randomized controlled trials showed that targeting a high blood hemoglobin concentration was associated with worse outcomes among nondialysis-dependent patients with CKD.

### Guideline on the investigation and management of acute transfusion reactions [^113Hdpv8]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute transfusion reactions, particularly in relation to clinical assessment, the BSH 2023 guidelines recommend checking identification details between the patient, their identity band, and the compatibility label of the blood component after discontinuing transfusion in patients who develop new symptoms or signs during transfusion. Inspect the component visually and assess the patient with standard observations.

### Identification of data-driven preoperative hemoglobin strata that predict the likelihood of blood transfusion and the risk of major complications and prosthetic joint infection after total hip arthroplasty [^1124ik2z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for complications after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Currently used hemoglobin thresholds are not developed for risk stratification of arthroplasty patients and do not provide surgery-specific information on postoperative complication risk. Thus, we aimed to calculate THA-specific preoperative hemoglobin strata that observe the likelihood of 90-day blood transfusion and determine whether these strata are associated with increased risk of 90-day complications and 2-year prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort analysis identified 56,101 patients who underwent primary THA from 2013 to 2022. Using the lowest hemoglobin value for each patient one month before THA, stratum-specific likelihood ratio (SSLR) analysis calculated sex-based hemoglobin strata associated with the likelihood of 90-day postoperative blood transfusion. Propensity score matching was performed. Incidence rates and risk of 90-day major complications and 2-year PJI were observed for each identified preoperative hemoglobin stratum.

- **Results**: SSLR analysis identified five male (strata, likelihood ratio [< 10.4 g/dL, 12.5; 10.5 to 11.4 g/dL, 8.0; 11.5 to 12.4 g/dL, 2.4; 12.5 to 13.4 g/dL, 1.3; 13.5 to 13.9 g/dL, 0.5]) and five female (< 8.9 g/dL, 10.7; 9.0 to 10.9 g/dL, 4.0; 11.0 to 11.4 g/dL, 2.0; 12.0 to 12.9 g/dL, 1.0; 13.0 to 13.4 g/dL, 0.6) preoperative hemoglobin strata associated with varying likelihoods of 90-day blood transfusion after THA. After matching in both male and female cohorts, as the calculated preoperative hemoglobin levels decreased, the likelihood of requiring a blood transfusion increased.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^111jFZne]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for bleeding, specifically in the management of preoperative anemia and thresholds, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering hemoglobin levels below 130 g/L as the point at which patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies as well as enhanced patient blood management measures.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^114FxChk]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

To update guidelines with the new findings from the TRACT trial, a consensus severe anaemia management algorithm was developed. The aim was to improve evidence-based clinical practice and avert the unnecessary use of transfusion in children with uncomplicated severe anaemia. However, two vital components of the transfusion management algorithm included both clinical and haemoglobin (Hb) monitoring. Using data from the TRACT trial, we were able to show that a minimum of three additional measurements of Hb over 48 hours of hospital stay would identify approximately 50% developing severe and complicated anaemia, since 76% of children required a transfusion following a drop in Hb below 40 g/l. From this watch-and-wait policy, there was no evidence of short- or long-term adverse events, including morbidity and mortality. The biggest concern raised at the meeting was that future evidence-based practice would require the provision of point-of-care (POC) Hb testing — something that most hospitals do not have.

### Seroquel XR [^112Kjob6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Decreased hemoglobin**: In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to ≤ 13 g/dL in males and ≤ 12 g/dL in females occurred at least once in 8.3% (594/7155) of quetiapine-treated patients, compared to 6.2% (219/3536) of those treated with placebo. Across a broader database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin reached these thresholds in 11% (2277/20729) of quetiapine-treated patients.

- **Interference with urine drug screens**: Literature reports suggest that false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants may occur in patients who have taken quetiapine. Interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these substances should be approached with caution, and confirmation by alternative analytical techniques, such as chromatographic methods, is advisable.

- **ECG changes**: In clinical trials, 2.5% of Seroquel XR patients and 2.3% of placebo patients experienced tachycardia (> 120 bpm) at some point. Seroquel XR was linked with a mean heart rate increase of 6.3 beats per minute, as assessed by ECG, compared to a 0.4 beats per minute increase for placebo. The adverse reaction incidence of tachycardia was 1.9% for Seroquel XR, versus 0.5% for placebo. Observations also indicate Seroquel use resulted in a mean heart rate increase of 7 beats per minute compared to 1 beat per minute in placebo patients. This reflects a slight tendency towards tachycardia.

### Preoperative anemia-screening clinics [^115qzz8p]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of perioperative transfusion. It is an important and modifiable risk factor for surgical patients. For high-blood-loss surgery, preoperative anemia is defined as hemoglobin levels below 13 g/dL for both male and female patients. Preoperative anemia is common, ranging from 25% to 40% in large observational studies. The most common treatable cause of preoperative anemia is iron-deficiency anemia; therefore, initial laboratory tests should focus on diagnosing this condition. Management of iron-deficiency anemia includes iron supplementation, with intravenous iron therapy recommended when oral iron is ineffective, not tolerated, there is severe anemia, or there is insufficient time to surgery (less than 4 weeks). In other situations, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may be considered, particularly for patients with multiple alloantibodies or religious objections to transfusion.

To facilitate the diagnosis and management of preoperative anemia, the establishment of preoperative anemia-screening clinics is essential. The goals of managing preoperative anemia are to treat anemia, reduce the need for transfusion, and improve patient outcomes.

### Do blood tests cause anemia in hospitalized patients? The effect of diagnostic phlebotomy on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels [^115qDNJG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether phlebotomy contributes to changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in hospitalized general internal medicine patients.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: General internal medicine inpatient service at a tertiary care hospital.
- **Participants**: All adult patients discharged from the Toronto General Hospital's internal medicine service between January 1 and June 30, 2001. A total of 989 hospitalizations were reviewed, and 404 hospitalizations were included in our analysis.
- **Measurements and main results**: Mean (SD) hemoglobin and hematocrit changes during hospitalization were 7.9 (12.6) g/L (p < 0.0001) and 2.1% (3.8%) (p < 0.0001), respectively. The mean (SD) volume of phlebotomy during the hospital stay was 74.6 (52.1) mL. On univariate analysis, changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit were predicted by the volume of phlebotomy, length of hospital stay, admission hemoglobin/hematocrit value, age, Charlson comorbidity index, and admission intravascular volume status. The volume of phlebotomy remained a strong predictor of the drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit after adjusting for other predictors using multivariate analysis (p < 0.0001). On average, every 100 mL of phlebotomy was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.0 g/L and 1.9%, respectively.

Conclusions from the study show that phlebotomy is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for patients admitted to an internal medicine service and can contribute to anemia. This anemia, in turn, may have significant consequences, especially for patients with cardiorespiratory disease.

### The epidemiology of hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116wzcnP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes, for whom it constitutes an additional burden. This study aims to clarify the natural history of anemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and describe factors that predict a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels.

- **Methods**: A 5-year prospective cohort study was designed as a follow-up of 503 individuals with type 2 diabetes in a single diabetes clinic. In addition to standard management, a full blood count was obtained at each routine visit. No intervention was undertaken to modify Hb levels.

- **Results**: At baseline, 12% of patients had anemia, and an additional 13% developed anemia during follow-up. Overall, Hb levels decreased by -0.07 ± 0.01 g/dL/y, suggesting that anemia is the endpoint of a process that begins more than 10 years previously with the initiation of vascular damage. The greatest decreases in Hb levels were seen in patients with macroalbuminuria, renal impairment, or established macrovascular disease at baseline (all P > 1.5 mL/s) or normoalbuminuria who had stable Hb levels during the 5-year follow-up. In patients with anemia in our cohort who were managed conservatively, Hb levels decreased by 0.09 ± 0.03 g/dL/y. This decrease was associated with HbA1c levels but not renal function.

- **Conclusion**: This study defines the natural history of Hb levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Early identification and monitoring are essential to managing anemia effectively in these patients.

### Atypical SARS in geriatric patient [^112qHgx7]. Emerging infectious diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Investigations on admission showed that the patient's hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count was 7,200/mm³ (86.3% polymorphs, 8.6% lymphocytes), and platelet count was 304,000/mm³. The serum urea was 6.6 mmol/L; serum potassium, 5.0 mmol/L; serum sodium, 138 mmol/L; and creatinine, 79 μmol/L. The liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 10.6 μmol/L; serum albumin, 30 g/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 106 U/L; serum alanine transaminase, 16 U/L; and serum aspartate transaminase, 33 U/L. Her creatine kinase was 45 U/L, and C-reactive protein was elevated at 147.0 mg/L. She was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole were prescribed. Her chest radiograph showed infiltrates in the right lower zone. Her urine, sputum, and blood cultures did not yield any bacterial growth. Serologic testing for Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia and nasopharyngeal aspirate for common viral antigens were not performed, as clinical suspicion was low.

She was subsequently transferred to the geriatric unit. Her condition improved, and she was placed in the general ward on March 28. No protective equipment was used by staff attending her in the general ward. It was ascertained that she was previously admitted to a non-SARS ward in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

However, on March 29, the patient became restless and more breathless. A repeat chest radiograph confirmed congestive cardiac failure. Her repeat leukocyte count was 8,800/mm³ (93.0% polymorphs, 4.5% lymphocytes), and the platelet count was 167,000/mm³. There was mild hyponatremia.

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: A consensus algorithm [^114xBFdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Children in the no immediate transfusion category were monitored clinically according to the algorithm, with Hb tests at 8, 24, and 48 hours. Transfusion was not administered unless they developed severity signs or their Hb dropped below 40 g/l. In the TRACT trial, 386 out of 787 children (49%) who were randomized to not receive an immediate transfusion eventually did receive one. Details of the timing of these triggered transfusions are provided in Figs 1 and 4A. Haemodilution, by liberal use of intravenous fluids, was discounted as no fluid boluses were given and children only received maintenance fluids until they could drink.

Compared to children randomized to immediate transfusion, who received blood at a median (interquartile range) of 1.3 [0.9–1.7] hours after randomization, 295 out of 386 children (76%) in the deferred transfusion group received a subsequent transfusion, primarily triggered by a fall in Hb to below 40 g/l. This occurred at a median (IQR) of 24.9 (9.2–49.8) hours after randomization. Transfusion was also administered to an additional 57 children (15%) due to the development of clinical severity features like impaired consciousness or increased work of breathing, and SCD identified in hospital (n = 7; 2%). Only 27 children (7%) had a transfusion without a very low Hb or a recorded severity feature, often after 48 hours, when reasons for transfusion were not routinely documented.

It is noteworthy that the timing of triggered transfusions largely coincided with the routine Hb assessments in the trial conducted at 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours after randomization.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in Black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning.

Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or an unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended, beginning with a colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

The 2024 guidelines from the British Society for Haematology recommend referring patients with unexplained anemia, specifically in cases without iron deficiency and in the context of surgery. This decision should be based on the severity of anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels below 120 g/L for males and below 100 g/L for females. Alternatively, locally agreed criteria may be used. It is important to recognize that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to the severity of anemia.

### An 8-year-old boy with fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia [^111rjk1j]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with five days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED) out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania ten months before admission.

The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multi-organ involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive.

In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination, along with appropriate laboratory test results, can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.
