## Question

What are the recommended LDL-C targets for patients with high cardiovascular risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended LDL-C targets for patients with high cardiovascular risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "high cardiovascular risk" across major guidelines. Then, I should verify the LDL-C targets by risk category, including very high, high, and moderate risk. Next, I will check whether these are absolute targets, percent reductions, or both, and reconcile any conflicting guidance. After that, I should review the evidence base supporting lower-is-better and treat-to-target strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation challenges, and synthesize a practical, clinically actionable answer with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification frameworks, because targets hinge on this. The European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) 2019 guidelines categorize patients as very high, high, moderate, or low risk, with very high risk including established ASCVD, recent ACS, or multiple high-risk features, and high risk including severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes with organ damage, or advanced CKD, among others [^79e4595d]. The ACC/AHA multisociety guidelines similarly identify very high risk in secondary prevention and high risk in primary prevention using 10-year ASCVD risk thresholds, with diabetes and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as additional high-risk groups, which aligns with the ESC/EAS schema in practice [^47c2f376] [^88dbcf29].

> Now, I should verify the LDL-C targets for very high risk. The ESC/EAS 2019 guideline recommends an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) plus at least a 50% reduction from baseline for very high-risk patients, with an even lower goal of less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) considered after a recurrent vascular event within 2 years on maximally tolerated therapy [^79e4595d] [^083cef36]. Wait, let me verify the ACC/AHA position here; the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway adopted the ≤ 55 mg/dL threshold for very high-risk ASCVD and endorsed adding nonstatins when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite high-intensity statins, reflecting convergence toward the European approach in this subgroup [^f64375f0].

> Next, I will examine the high-risk category. The ESC/EAS guideline recommends an LDL-C target of less than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) plus at least a 50% reduction from baseline for high-risk patients, which includes primary prevention with markedly elevated LDL-C, diabetes with multiple risk factors, or advanced CKD without established ASCVD [^ce171f27]. Hold on, I should confirm the ACC/AHA stance; while the 2018/2019 ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize percent reductions rather than absolute targets in primary prevention, they align with a < 70 mg/dL goal in secondary prevention and support high-intensity statins with percent-reduction targets, and the 2022 ACC pathway operationalizes < 70 mg/dL as a reasonable threshold for adding nonstatins in high-risk secondary prevention patients who do not achieve ≥ 50% reduction or remain ≥ 70 mg/dL [^47c2f376] [^f64375f0].

> I need to check the moderate-risk category to ensure completeness. The ESC/EAS guideline suggests an LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) for moderate-risk patients, which typically reflects primary prevention with 2 or more major risk factors and intermediate 10-year risk, while acknowledging that many patients will still benefit from meaningful LDL-C lowering even if they do not reach this numeric target [^6082eeb8]. Let me reconsider whether percent reductions are emphasized here; ESC/EAS prioritizes absolute targets by risk, whereas ACC/AHA emphasizes percent reductions in primary prevention, so both approaches are guideline-concordant depending on the system used [^47c2f376] [^79e4595d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about whether these are absolute targets, percent reductions, or both. I should confirm that both ESC/EAS and ACC/AHA endorse a dual strategy: achieve a relative reduction of at least 50% from baseline and reach an absolute LDL-C threshold, because this captures both plaque regression biology and event reduction observed in trials; the ACC/AHA also uses percent-reduction anchors in primary prevention (≥ 50% for high risk, ≥ 30% for intermediate risk), which functionally pushes many patients to very low LDL-C levels even without a named target [^79e4595d] [^47c2f376] [^88dbcf29].

> Next, I should review the evidence base supporting lower-is-better and treat-to-target. Multiple meta-analyses and large trials show a log-linear relationship between LDL-C lowering and event reduction, with no identified lower bound of benefit down to very low levels, and genetic studies of lifelong low LDL-C support safety and greater risk reduction over decades; this underpins the ESC/EAS push to < 55 mg/dL in very high risk and informs the ACC's adoption of the ≤ 55 mg/dL threshold in 2022 [^ff93c869] [^4e3ea709] [^f64375f0]. But wait, what if some guidelines still reject targets? The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline moved away from numeric targets toward percent-reduction and intensity-based statin therapy, yet subsequent ACC expert consensus has reintroduced thresholds for adding nonstatins, reflecting evolving evidence and pragmatic clinical needs, so the current state is a hybrid of intensity-first with treat-to-threshold escalation in very high risk [^73010106] [^f64375f0].

> I will now examine special populations where targets may differ. For familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD, ESC/EAS applies the same very high-risk targets (< 55 mg/dL and ≥ 50% reduction) and recommends combination therapy early to achieve goals; for severe hypertriglyceridemia, non–HDL-C or apoB are preferred secondary targets; for older adults, especially > 75 years, individualized decisions balance benefit and frailty, though continuation or initiation of statins is reasonable when benefit is expected [^3bbd089b] [^7e40909f] [^c0d53b42]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ACC/AHA might not address FH targets; let me verify — ACC/AHA recognizes LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as a statin benefit group and supports high-intensity therapy, and contemporary pathways endorse adding ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors when LDL-C remains high, which operationalizes aggressive lowering in FH even if not framed as a numeric target [^47c2f376] [^f64375f0].

> Next, I should review implementation and real-world attainment, because targets without uptake are not helpful. Observational data show that only about one in five very high-risk patients achieve < 55 mg/dL, and roughly two-thirds fail to reach < 70 mg/dL, underscoring the need for systematic combination therapy and adherence support; this is why guidelines increasingly position ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as essential next steps when thresholds are not met on statins alone [^55e0947e] [^6180e233] [^f64375f0]. Hold on, I should verify the sequence; ACC/AHA and ESC/EAS both favor ezetimibe first, then PCSK9 inhibitor if needed, with shared decision-making given modest absolute benefits and injection burden in lower-risk groups [^f64375f0] [^385980b8].

> Let me synthesize a clinically actionable answer. For very high cardiovascular risk (established ASCVD, recent ACS, or multiple high-risk features), target LDL-C less than 55 mg/dL and ensure at least a 50% reduction from baseline, escalating to ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor if not achieved; consider an even lower goal of less than 40 mg/dL after a recurrent event within 2 years on maximal therapy [^79e4595d] [^f64375f0] [^083cef36]. For high cardiovascular risk (e.g., severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes with organ damage, advanced CKD, or high-risk primary prevention), target LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL and aim for at least a 50% reduction from baseline, adding nonstatins if thresholds are not met on high-intensity statins [^ce171f27] [^f64375f0]. For moderate risk, a reasonable target is less than 100 mg/dL, recognizing that percent-reduction strategies in primary prevention often yield substantial absolute LDL-C drops even without a strict numeric target [^6082eeb8] [^47c2f376]. I should double-check that this aligns with both European treat-to-target and US intensity-plus-threshold models; yes, this synthesis respects both frameworks while translating them into practical goals [^79e4595d] [^f64375f0].

For high-risk patients, the recommended LDL-C target is **< 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)** with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^ce171f27] [^79e4595d]. For very high-risk patients, the target is **< 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)** with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^79e4595d] [^f64375f0]. These targets are supported by major guidelines and reflect the "lower for longer" principle, with no evidence of harm at very low LDL-C levels [^4e3ea709] [^9e9c1967]. If targets are not met with maximally tolerated statins, add ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor as needed [^f64375f0] [^385980b8].

## Recommended LDL-C targets for high-risk patients

| **Risk category** | **Recommended ldl-c target** | **Additional recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| High risk | < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) | ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^ce171f27] [^79e4595d] |
| Very high risk | < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) | ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^79e4595d] [^f64375f0] |

---

These targets are endorsed by the **ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines** [^79e4595d] and the **2022 ACC Expert Consensus** [^f64375f0], which emphasize aggressive LDL-C lowering to reduce cardiovascular events.

---

## Evidence supporting lower LDL-C targets

- **IMPROVE-IT trial**: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe achieved LDL-C ~54 mg/dL and reduced cardiovascular events more than simvastatin alone, supporting lower targets [^6972aec1].
- **FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES**: PCSK9 inhibitors achieved LDL-C ~30 mg/dL and reduced cardiovascular events, confirming benefit at very low levels [^notfound].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show a log-linear relationship between LDL-C reduction and event reduction, with no lower threshold of benefit [^ff93c869] [^4e3ea709].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

- **First-line therapy**: High-intensity statins are first-line to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^c0d53b42].
- **Second-line therapy**: Add ezetimibe if targets are not met on statins [^bf6de20a].
- **Third-line therapy**: Add PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains above target [^f64375f0] [^385980b8].
- **Monitoring**: Regular lipid panels to assess adherence and response, with therapy adjusted to reach targets [^5532cf70].

---

## Safety considerations

Very low LDL-C levels (** < 40 mg/dL**) are not associated with significant adverse effects in clinical trials, and lifelong low LDL-C (15–30 mg/dL) is linked to lower ASCVD risk without harm [^4e3ea709] [^f64375f0]. Nonetheless, monitor for potential neurocognitive or ophthalmologic effects with sustained very low levels [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High risk**: Target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^ce171f27] [^79e4595d].
- **Very high risk**: Target LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^79e4595d] [^f64375f0].
- **Implementation**: Use statins first, then ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitors as needed [^f64375f0] [^385980b8].
- **Safety**: Very low LDL-C levels are generally safe, with continued monitoring [^4e3ea709] [^717f6ba8].

---

The recommended LDL-C targets for high-risk patients are **< 70 mg/dL** with a ≥ 50% reduction, and for very high-risk patients **< 55 mg/dL** with a ≥ 50% reduction, supported by robust evidence and major guidelines.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^33b347dd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### How do we achieve optimal cardiovascular risk reduction? [^ab822240]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Optimizing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction requires the application of clinical evidence to patient care, as well as the refinement of risk assessment. Clinical evidence indicates that most patients are not treated to optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. Despite the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the incidence of CHD, many treated patients still experience CHD events. Targeting other lipid factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides may augment the risk reduction achieved by lowering LDL cholesterol. Refined global risk assessment can lead to more accurate determinations of absolute risk and to the identification both of high-risk patients needing aggressive intervention and intermediate-risk patients who appear to be at low risk. Previous global risk assessment measures failed to identify a substantial proportion of primary prevention patients who would benefit from therapy. However, revised guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program introduce new criteria for more precise risk assessment and advocate use of the Framingham scoring system to calculate absolute risk. Although intensified treatment is recommended for high-risk patients, cost considerations may limit drug therapy for some lower-risk individuals.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^79cf8b96]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^2f60983a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^385980b8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^0b4ed5c7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^73010106]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^5532cf70]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### Narrative review: lack of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets: a solvable problem [^bfeca04c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Recent national recommendations have proposed that physicians should titrate lipid therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk and less than 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) for patients at high cardiovascular risk. To examine the clinical evidence for these recommendations, the authors sought to review all controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examined the independent relationship between LDL cholesterol and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL). For those with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL), the authors found no clinical trial subgroup analyses or valid cohort or case-control analyses suggesting that the degree to which LDL cholesterol responds to a statin independently predicts the degree of cardiovascular risk reduction. Published studies had avoidable limitations, such as a reliance on ecological (aggregate) analyses, use of analyses that ignore statins' other proposed mechanisms of action, and failure to account for known confounders (especially healthy volunteer effects). Clear, compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy in patients at high cardiovascular risk (regardless of their natural LDL cholesterol values), but current clinical evidence does not demonstrate that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL cholesterol levels is beneficial or safe.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^2261d16c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

International LDL-C targets and risk relationship — The risk of ASCVD events is directly proportional to the achieved LDL-C concentration, with benefit observed down to levels below 20 mg/dL, and international guidelines endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk populations; specifically, the European Atherosclerosis Society recommends an LDL-C goal of < 40 mg/dL for patients with recurrent events, while the Lipid Association of India advocates for a target < 30 mg/dL in individuals classified as extreme risk, and patient messaging emphasizes lipid-lowering therapy to reduce ASCVD risk because LDL-C is the building block for atheroma formation.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular disease prevention: the search for superior treatment [^282d0bfc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Current US lipid-lowering guidelines indicate that optimal plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are < 100 mg/dL, and targeting global risk assessment has significantly increased the number of individuals who are candidates for intensive plasma lipid-lowering therapy. There is accumulating evidence that reduction of plasma LDL-C concentrations to targets even lower than those currently recommended may provide additional benefit in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention. For example, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) found that statin treatment initiated at a baseline LDL-C plasma level of < 100 mg/dL in patients at high risk provided a relative benefit in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events that was similar to when it was initiated at higher LDL-C plasma levels. In addition, it is becoming clear that CHD risk, and the need for intensive lipid-lowering treatment, may be underestimated in some populations, including individuals with the metabolic syndrome. In the overall primary prevention population, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurement has been shown to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events who would not be considered at high risk on the basis of current systems of risk assessment. The increasing focus on intensive plasma lipid lowering to reduce CHD risk has placed a premium on the development of therapies with improved ability to reduce plasma levels of LDL-C.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^0f3dcf67]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^2359437f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Combination therapy in dyslipidemia: where are we now? [^8a787689]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease: each 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C reduces the incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic stroke by approximately 20%. Statins are a well-established treatment option for dyslipidemia, with LDL-C reduction in the range of 27–55%. Several lipid goal-driven guidelines recommend reducing LDL-C to < 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or < 1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in very high-risk patients. Many patients treated with statins do not reach these goals, and remain at risk of future cardiovascular events. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines move away from advocating LDL-C treatment targets with focus placed on identifying patients most likely to benefit from high-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy. While increasing the statin dose can prove efficacious in some patients, this approach typically offers limited additional LDL-C lowering, and is associated with increased incidence of adverse side effects. Indeed, this has led to the investigation of statins in combination with other lipid-modifying agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This review of the evidence for statin use in combination with fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in dyslipidemic patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, explores the impact of such combination therapies on lipids, attainment of lipid targets, inflammatory markers, and on cardiovascular outcomes and pathology. Additionally, new and emerging dyslipidemia treatments are summarized.

### Cholesterol-lowering agents [^bb2f4b9e]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. To date, decades of research has established LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as a causal factor in the development of atherosclerotic CVD. Statin therapy, supported by a broad evidence base, has demonstrated its superior efficacy in reducing LDL-C and subsequent cardiovascular risk. It therefore currently forms the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy as recommended by international guidelines. Statin therapy is indicated in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD, as well as genetic causes of dyslipidemia (such as familial hypercholesterolemia). Although this strategy targets those most at risk, it merely addresses those most susceptible and does not account for the fact that most cardiovascular events occur in those at moderate to low risk. In addition, there is evidence for use in primary prevention such as in those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and high risk of future atherosclerotic CVD as determined by risk prediction calculators. Risk prediction tools, however, are far from perfect and do not accurately account for those at low short-term but high lifelong risk. Considering the log-linear relationship between LDL-C reductions and reductions in risk of atherosclerotic CVD, even in those at very low risk of future events, a clinical question posed is can we and should we shift the entire risk distribution by treating everyone? The present review discusses these issues in more detail outlining arguments for and against each approach.

### Optimal target of LDL cholesterol level for statin treatment: challenges to monotonic relationship with cardiovascular events [^5502b1c1]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The "The lower, the better" concept for LDL-C has been proposed by many statin trials and was strengthened by the recent non-statin lipid-lowering therapy trials. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend aggressive goals for LDL-C lowering, such as < 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, < 1.4 mmol/l (< 55 mg/dl) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and < 1.0 mmol/l (< 40 mg/dl) for very high-risk patients who experienced a secondary vascular event within 2 years. Some believers in the "The lower, the better" concept, especially the followers of PCSK9 inhibitors, state that no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined. On the other hand, the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines identified a threshold LDL-C value of 70 mg/dl, at which addition of a non-statin to high-intensity statin therapy could be considered, but recommends high-intensity statin therapy for the secondary prevention and for patients with high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of the baseline LDL-C without setting a specific target LDL-C, i.e. "Fire and forget", which is the opposite concept of the "Treat to target". Therefore, regarding statin treatment, no consensus has yet reached as to "The lower, the better", "Fire and forget", or "Treat to target", which has been in debate for a long time. Moreover, the universal target LDL-C for lipid-lowering treatments has not been established. In the present subanalysis, we assumed a threshold value of LDL-C every 10 mg/dl, and 70 mg/dl LDL-C showed the best-fit as the threshold value for the primary composite outcomes. The novelty of the present subanalysis lies in an aggressive search for the "bottom" of LDL-C value, i.e. the value below which events may not decrease even if it is reduced further. We believe that our "bottoming-out model" would have a certain impact, in which the shape of the assumed model was changed including the threshold value, and the model fit was compared.

### Management of cardiovascular risk: the importance of meeting lipid targets [^24ace9bd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^4a4e6a58]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^ff826769]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence that 'lower is better' for LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in terms of secondary CVD prevention is well supported by evidence, and the recent advent of PCSK9 inhibitors further supports this notion. The issue at hand is how to use this information clinically to support a testing regimen. In this regard, the use of cholesterol targets for therapy is contentious, in part because the evidence for their use is less strong. While research has shown that achieving targets is associated with better outcomes, no specific randomised controlled trial has shown that randomising patients to a target improves adherence or event rates. Indeed, it might be argued that the maximally tolerated statin should be initiated as the default, and therefore a hard target may be moot. Clearly, other lipid-lowering medications could be added to therapy. Despite the lack of strong evidence, many guidelines recommended specific lipid targets, with many choosing similar values, suggesting that guideline committees are likely to be examining the same evidence. However, one of the most recently published guidelines, the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias (ESCEAS) advised the lowest cholesterol targets of all the included guidelines (LDL < 1.4 mmol/L), with further lower levels for those with multiple recent cardiovascular events (LDL < 1.0 mmol/L). This was rated as being supported by strong and moderate levels of evidence, although the guidelines acknowledged that both targets are based on the LDL levels achieved in the trials for PCSK9 inhibitors.

Conclusions

In summary, a personalized approach, identifying patients at risk of ASCVD earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies in combination with statins, will enable more patients to achieve LDL‐C targets and help to address the current high global burden of ASCVD.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^93986ea3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.

High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies, the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD event can be assessed in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL. Patients with diabetes who have multiple ASCVD risk factors should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels by 50% or more, according to data from RCTs.

Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized trials, it is reasonable to obtain a coronary artery calcium score for patients 40 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^67391d48]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^9f78cada]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The WHO recommends that those with established cardiovascular disease should be treated with lipid-lowering therapy, but there is no specific guidance regarding lipid monitoring. Unnecessary general practitioner visits may be a burden for patients and increase healthcare costs. A systematic review of the current guidelines was performed to reveal gaps in the evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring approaches.

Methods

For this systematic review, a search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for relevant guidelines published in the 10 years prior to 31 December 2019. Recommendations surrounding the frequency of testing, lipid-lowering therapies and target cholesterol values were compared qualitatively. Each guideline was assessed using the 2009 Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool.

Results

Twenty-two guidelines were included. All recommended statins as the primary lipid-lowering therapy, with a high level of supporting evidence. Considerable variation was found in the recommendations for cholesterol targets. Seventeen guidelines provided at least one cholesterol target, which for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was < 1.8 mmol/L (n = 12). For long-term follow-up, many recommended reviewing patients annually (n = 9), although there was some variation in recommendations for the interval of between 3 and 12 months. Supporting evidence for any approach was limited, often being derived from clinical opinion.

Conclusions

Further research is required to provide an evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring of the on-statin secondary prevention population.

### Achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds in very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^55e0947e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Nonstatin Therapies recommended more aggressive management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Guideline. In congruence with European guidelines, a target LDL-C threshold of 55 mg/dL is recommended for patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Real-world status of the early implementation of this recommendation remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine the proportion of patients with very high-risk ASCVD achieving an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL and characterize differences between patients who did and did not achieve this LDL-C value.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, who were ≥ 18 years old with very high-risk ASCVD from the University of Colorado Health system primary care practices. Very high-risk ASCVD was defined as a history of a major ASCVD event with at least 2 high-risk conditions.

Results

A total of 8974 patients met inclusion criteria for very high-risk ASCVD. Of these, only 21.0% achieved an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, while 39.5% of patients achieved the previously recommended LDL-C threshold of < 70 mg/dL. More than half of patients were prescribed a high-intensity statin-based regimen.

Conclusion

Within a large, academic health-system, achievement of LDL-C threshold among patients with very high-risk ASCVD was low. Recommendations from the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway that endorse more aggressive LDL-C lowering and emphasize nonstatin therapies as an adjunct to statins are not fully implemented in real-world clinical practice.

### Current and future aims of lipid-lowering therapy: changing paradigms and lessons from the heart protection study on standards of efficacy and safety [^afce48bb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering guidelines continue to evolve toward the use of (1) global risk assessment, (2) lipid measures other than or in addition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in assessment of risk and treatment benefit, and (3) recommendations for more aggressive lipid lowering. Findings in the Heart Protection Study (HPS) indicate that high-risk patients benefit from statin therapy initiated at a dose that provides aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol. Statin treatment in this trial provided consistent benefits in reducing major vascular events among a wide variety of high-risk patients, including those beginning treatment with LDL cholesterol levels < 100 mg/dL. The HPS findings therefore suggest that the optimal LDL cholesterol level is well below current target levels. In addition, they provide reassurance that aggressive statin therapy is safe. Frequently, current targets for LDL cholesterol are not achieved in clinical practice, particularly among those patients who have coronary artery disease or are at high risk of disease. More intensive lipid lowering than that currently practiced is necessary to achieve current goals and to provide the aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol shown to improve outcomes in clinical trials. New statins, such as rosuvastatin, offer the prospect of improved lipid-lowering therapy.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^4e37c6a8]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The Panel believes there is insufficient evidence to permit definition of targets for triglycerides or HDL-C for these high-risk patients. Instead, the Panel proposes that treatment should be tailored to the individual to achieve desirable levels below (for triglycerides or non-HDL-C) or above (for HDL-C) the recommended cut-offs (Box 6). The Panel acknowledges that other expert bodies recommend apo B as a secondary therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridaemic patients. but considers that the precise clinical yield of this approach has yet to be demonstrated. The Panel also recognizes the limitations of the current evidence base for fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, including the lack of hard outcome data for statin–niacin and statin–omega-3 fatty acid combination therapies. Clearly, there is a need for well-defined trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic combinations in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^84cd4523]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Post hoc analyses of prospective trials in ACS and stable CHD patients reveal that elevated plasma levels of triglycerides and low plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are intimately associated with this high risk, even at or below recommended LDL-C goals. – Furthermore, in T2DM patients, the UKPDS identified HDL-C as the second most important coronary risk factor, after LDL-C. Despite these data, guidelines are inconsistent in their recommendations for proposed levels of HDL-C or triglycerides either for initiation of additional therapies or for targets for such treatments in patients at LDL-C goal.–

The aim of this paper is to critically appraise the current evidence relating to triglycerides and HDL-C as CV risk factors or markers and to consider therapeutic strategies for their management. The focus is on individuals with cardiometabolic risk, characterized by the clustering of central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension, which together increase the risk of CVD and T2DM.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^36dffbdb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Chart 2 — Targets for atherogenic cholesterol in dyslipidemia management state that when intervention beyond public health recommendations for long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction is used, atherogenic cholesterol (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) should be the primary targets for therapies, with desirable levels for primary prevention of < 130 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 100 mg/dL for LDL-C; goals for very high risk patients are < 100 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 70 mg/dL for LDL-C, and goal levels of non–HDL-C may be attained by targeting either or both LDL-C and VLDL-C.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^c6e1a4cf]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^4e3ea709]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at highest risk, within the paradigm of 'lower is better'. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality. Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that, over the 5–7 years of treatment experience to date, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing lifelong very low LDL-C levels (< 1.4mmol/L; < 55mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarises key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to reduce markedly LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance for clinical practice.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^7e40909f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD — Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^f64375f0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^af5f5d22]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

National Lipid Association — ASCVD risk categories and atherogenic cholesterol targets are organized as follows: For low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors), treatment goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL; for moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL; for high risk (criteria include ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL; for very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage), goals are Non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^76dd609f]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Plasma lipid recommendations

Seventeen of the guidelines provided at least one target, with all except one of these providing an LDL cholesterol goal. Target values ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was < 1.8 mmol/L (n = 12). Many guidelines additionally suggested that a 50% reduction in LDL could be used as an alternative where this target may be unattainable or for patients whose baseline values were already < 3.5 mmol/L (n = 7). A non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol target was also common (n = 8), with target values ranging from 2.5 to 3.4 mmol/L, with 2.6 mmol/L the most frequent (n = 5). These targets were usually given in combination with a target for LDL cholesterol, though in the case of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society, the non-HDL target was considered only relevant when a patient's triglycerides were elevated. Meanwhile, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not provide a numerical target for non-HDL, recommending a 40% reduction from the patient's baseline only. Only two guidelines referred to other lipid parameters in their recommendations. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCSG) provided an apolipoprotein B target as an alternative for LDL, and the International Diabetes Federation provided additional targets for triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. There were no apparent differences in recommendations for stroke or diabetes-specific guidelines, although some guidelines for all secondary prevention populations provided different targets for those patients with additional comorbidities (n = 2), or specific cardiovascular events (n = 2).

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^c430c24b]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^44f73ad5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Optimal target of LDL cholesterol level for statin treatment: challenges to monotonic relationship with cardiovascular events [^5b1ca4c8]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies have shown that an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, and it has been established that LDL-C lowering with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is effective for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). There has been a growing number of clinical trials for the secondary prevention of CAD, in which aggressive and conventional statin therapies were compared. A meta-analysis of these trials found that the odds ratio of aggressive therapy to conventional therapy for the development of cardiovascular events was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.80–0.89). On the basis of these results, a level below 70 mg/dl was recommended as a goal of LDL-C lowering management in CAD patients. A subanalysis of the Justification for the Use of the Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial showed that the attainment of LDL-C < 50 mg/dl achieved a lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with the failure to do so in high-risk CAD patients, leading to the "The lower, the better" concept. In addition, recent trials for non-statin lipid-lowering therapy, including ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, have strengthened the "The even lower, the even better" concept for LDL-C. Actually in the clinical setting, however, we occasionally experience cardiovascular events even if LDL-C is extremely lowered by using PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, the "The lower, the better" concept was based on American and European evidence, and it is uncertain that it can be applied to Japanese and east Asian CAD patients, who have a lower cardiovascular event risk than CAD patients in Western countries. Therefore, we hypothesized that the LDL-C level that should be targeted for Japanese CAD patients to reduce cardiovascular events would be higher than that for Western patients and that there would be an optimal target of LDL-C, i.e. a "threshold" value, below which it does not affect the incidence of cardiovascular events.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^6ed7724e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

Clinical considerations on lower LDL-C targets — prior guidance noted a goal of < 55 mg/dl for high-risk individuals, but evidence shows limited incremental benefit: in a double-blind randomized trial of 18 144 patients with recent acute coronary syndromes, simvastatin plus ezetimibe achieved LDL-C < 55 mg/dl and yielded a trivial decrease in MACE with hazard ratio 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.99) without differences in mortality or other cardiovascular outcomes; a meta-analysis found no statistically significant differences for mortality or cardiovascular outcomes between those achieving LDL-C < 55 mg/dl and those who did not; a 2019 meta-analysis of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies based on achieved LDL-C < 50 mg/dl reported no substantial clinical benefit in all-cause mortality, CV-related mortality, MI, or stroke; in summary, treatment goals of < 55 mg/dl do not appear to provide substantial additional clinical benefit.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^efb5fedd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^a65966f8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^5ac5af12]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^ff93c869]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^60f4d2b1]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Compliance with dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice: how effective is cardiovascular risk prevention? [^4f124a1a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of early mortality and morbidity. The current European guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice recommend the use of the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) system. The current American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of the new pooled cohort risk assessment equations to estimate the 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk. The purpose of this article was to investigate the compliance of dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice in patients with dyslipidemia or who have risk factors for CVD.

Methods

The study group consisted of 500 outpatients who had dyslipidemia or risk factors for CVD. The risk level was computed according to the European and American Heart Association guidelines. Therapeutic LDL-C targets were identified based on the calculated risk level. Therapeutic target levels were compared based on the dosage of statins used and achievement of the LDL-C goal in daily practice according to the risk levels.

Findings

According to the European dyslipidemia guidelines, 231 patients were in the very-high/high-risk group, and 106 patients (45.9%) achieved the LDL-C target (< 100 mg/dL); 210 patients were in the moderate-risk group, and 156 (74.3%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (< 115 mg/dL); and 59 patients were in the low-risk group, and 55 (93.2%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (< 155 mg/dL). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the LDL-C level and presence of coronary artery disease were significantly reverse associated with achievement of the LDL-C goal (both, P < 0.001).

Implications

Our results showed that the majority of patients were in the very-high/high-risk group in daily practice. Although the European dyslipidemia guidelines are more likely to be used in daily practice, achievement of the guidelines-recommended treatment goals was low.

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### Estimation of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular event risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease: the updated SMART2 algorithm [^a3f46a01]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, are the most common non-communicable diseases globally, and were responsible for an estimated 17.8 million deaths worldwide in 2017. Clinical guidelines advocate the use of risk prediction models in patients without vascular disease or diabetes, since those at high risk of ASCVD are more likely to benefit from preventive strategies. Clinical guidelines have traditionally advised classification of all patients with established vascular disease as being at 'very high risk' for future (recurrent) ASCVD events. This universal approach to allocating risk among secondary prevention patients ignores the fact that the individual level of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk can vary in these patientsand precludes the option for a more personalized approach to risk factor management in secondary prevention. More intensive treatment options, such as lower treatment targets for blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol, or additional antithrombotic strategies have been proven to further reduce the risk of ASCVD events. However, their implementation has been generally modest, in part reflecting uncertainties about cost benefits from implementing these at scale or uncertainties about individual risk-benefits such as the risk of major bleeding. This makes the identification of patients who may benefit most from more intensive therapy a key issue in clinical practice today. For this reason, more recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines now recommend that clinicians consider including information on risk to help inform clinician–patient joint decision-making for secondary prevention treatments.

Initiate a combination therapy if goals cannot be achieved.

### Are we aggressive enough in lowering cholesterol? [^eb5c1715]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

To date, 5 major randomized, placebo-controlled statin trials — the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial, Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease, and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study — have convincingly shown that total mortality and major coronary events can be significantly reduced by lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy. These results were achieved in a broad range of patients including those with and without a history of coronary artery disease and with elevated or average LDL-C levels. The results also support the large body of epidemiologic evidence demonstrating that the lower the cholesterol level, the lower the cardiovascular risk. Evidence now substantially supports the urgency of physicians to aggressively target the lowering of LDL-C levels for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab in high cardiovascular risk patients with inadequately controlled hypercholesterolaemia on maximally tolerated doses of statins: the ODYSSEY COMBO II randomized controlled trial [^fc589448]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD). Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins lowers the risk of CHD events and all-cause mortalityand there is a clear relation between the degree of absolute LDL-C lowering and the degree of cardiovascular event reduction. Consequently, LDL-C reduction is the primary target to reduce cardiac events. Comparative data of intensive vs. standard-dose statin treatment suggest that the lower the LDL-C concentration, the greater the benefit in high cardiovascular risk patients. The recommended treatment target for LDL-C is < 2.6 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) in patients at high risk and < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL), or a ≤ 50% reduction from baseline, in those at very high risk. – Despite more widespread use of intensive statin therapy, a substantial proportion of high-risk hypercholesterolaemic patients do not achieve adequate LDL-C reduction. While the latest US guidelines emphasize the use of intensive statin therapy, they call for evidence for new lipid-modifying agents to determine the incremental cardiovascular disease event-reduction benefits on top of statin therapy. Such therapies include fully human monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), including alirocumab (formerly SAR236553/REGN727) and evolocumab.

Alirocumab reduces LDL-C concentrations by 40–70% in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) or as monotherapy. – Guided by these very large reductions, even in combination with concomitant LLT, the COMBO II study (NCT01644188) was designed to test the hypothesis of the superiority of alirocumab vs. ezetimibe in LDL-C reduction in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events and who require additional pharmacological management because their current statin therapy failed to achieve their LDL-C treatment goal. The selection of doses, dosing frequency, and dose-increase approach was based on the LDL-C reduction needed to provide the best achievement of the target LDL-C level at the lowest dose.

Very low LDL-C on high-intensity statins — in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol falls to very low levels (eg, LDL-C, < 40 mg/dL), at present, no evidence suggests harm, and therapy may be continued, particularly in those at very high ASCVD event risk, in the absence of signs or symptoms of intolerance; the limited amount of data available at these low levels is acknowledged.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^0bce638d]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and goals for intensive LDL-C lowering in the 2020s

The case for intensive LDL-C lowering is well made, and for most individuals we now have the means to achieve whatever goal is deemed most appropriate for their level of cardiovascular risk. This presents an opportunity for a treatment approach where the 'high-intensity statin' concept in patients at highest risk is replaced by a tailored 'high-intensity lipid-lowering' strategy. The challenge is how to implement this strategy given that in most patients achieving the new goals will require add-on, non-statin LDL-C-lowering therapy such as ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 inhibitor (monoclonal antibody or inclisiran), or possibly bempedoic acid — an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis with complementary action to that of statins. For PCSK9 inhibitors, cost-effectiveness considerations have been discussed in recent publicationsand have led to promotion of a 'highest risk–highest benefit' approach in guidelines. Results from studies such as EUROASPIRE Vand DA VINCIindicate that achievement of the previous (2016) goalswas already challenging. Addressing the newer, more ambitious LDL-C goals means that combination lipid-lowering therapy for many patients at high and very high risk will become the rule rather than the exception.

### The ACC / AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: the good the bad and the uncertain: a comparison with ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias 2011 [^042611cb]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30–50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f3166b0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of treatment goals — evidence base notes that most RCTs of lipid-lowering drug therapies have tested drug treatment against a placebo control or compared more intensive with less-intensive regimens, and the strategy of treating patients to a specific level of LDL-C or non–HDL-C has not been tested in any of the large trials assessing ASCVD morbidity and mortality; however, the lack of RCTs explicitly designed to test goals does not invalidate the considerable evidence supporting use of goals; taken together, RCTs using various methods for lowering atherogenic cholesterol have indicated that lower on-treatment levels have been consistently associated with lower absolute risk for an ASCVD event, aligning with observational studies that suggest a log-linear relationship between atherogenic cholesterol levels and absolute ASCVD event risk.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^e740b975]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^d5729803]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Part 1 recommendations — ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C < 130 and LDL-C < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 or LDL-C ≥ 160. Moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 or LDL-C ≥ 130. High risk (≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 or LDL-C ≥ 100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C < 100 and LDL-C < 70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 or LDL-C ≥ 70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

When uncertainty exists, CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults, and a CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show reduced benefit from starting a statin.

### Clinical commentary: reaching new targets in monotherapy and combination therapy [^9ca80ebd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in the United States. There has, however, been a decline in the age-adjusted death rate for coronary heart disease. This decline may be due, in part, to more aggressive treatment guidelines for treating cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The 2004 update to the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines have recommended lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in high-risk patients. Based on the new targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, clinicians will need more efficacious lipid-lowering therapies and improved options for combination therapy. Statin and statin-based combinations have been the mainstays of therapy during the last several years, and as statin utilization increases in the United States, more high-risk patients become exposed to potential statin intolerance. This commentary reviews statin-sparing combinations and use of cholesterol-absorption inhibitors.

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^b5725569]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

ASCVD moderate-risk category — criteria and lipid goals: Patients with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, without conditions placing them into the high- or very high–risk categories, are at moderate risk; consideration should be given to drug therapy in those with values at least 30 mg/dL above goal levels after initiation of lifestyle therapy. For moderate risk, the non–HDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL and the LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III guidelines [^86e6f285]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.

### Prevalence of dyslipidemia and lipid goal attainment in statin-treated subjects from 3 data sources: a retrospective analysis [^26e6cf46]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines for reducing cardiovascular risk focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the basis of extensive evidence from primary and secondary prevention trials with statins. Treatment goals for LDL-C, as specified by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, are risk stratified: < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients (coronary heart disease [CHD] or CHD risk equivalents, 10-year risk > 20%), < 130 mg/dL for moderate-risk patients (≥ 2 risk factors, 10-year risk 10% to 20%), and < 160 mg/dL for low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk factors). CHD risk assessment is generally evaluated with the Framingham scoring system, which takes into account cigarette smoking, treated or untreated systolic hypertension, sex, age, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The 2004 update to the NCEP ATP III added an optional LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients (established cardiovascular disease [CVD] with multiple major risk factors), which also has been endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association. –

Although statins are excellent at reducing LDL-C and remain the mainstay of lipid-modifying therapies, patients optimally treated with statins continue to have cardiovascular events. One potential reason for this might be suboptimal non–HDL-C levels. The NCEP ATP III recommends non–HDL-C as a secondary target in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) (≥ 200 mg/dL) after the LDL-C goal has been achieved.

There is some confirmation, based on recent evaluations and reviews, that non–HDL-C does have an impact on cardiovascular outcomes. – Additionally, Boekholdt et al, in a meta-analysis evaluating statin-treated patients, concluded that elevated non–HDL-C imparted just as much high risk for cardiovascular events as elevated LDL-C. With the growing evidence that non–HDL-C is a better predictor of outcomes, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Diabetes Association Consensus Conference, in 2008 endorsed non–HDL-C as a cotarget in patients with cardiometabolic risk.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^2173398a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) performance measure denominator and evidence — The target population for the ASCVD PM includes women and men between 18 and 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, which includes the following: ACS, history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary (including PCI) or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or PAD, and patients with clinical ASCVD represent 1 of 4 major groups identified by the writing committee of the Cholesterol Guidelines. For these patients, treatment with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, commonly known as a statin, is clearly beneficial, and the potential for reduction of risk for ASCVD with statins in these patients clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects. Meta-analyses of individual participant data from 26 RCTs demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality, and of the 26 RCTs included, 5 trials (39 612 subjects, all of whom had CAD) compared more versus less intensive statin regimens, with more intensive regimens producing a highly significant 15% further reduction in major vascular events. On extensive examination of clinical studies from the literature, the current clinical evidence does not support the notion that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL-C levels is beneficial or safe, whereas compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk regardless of their LDL-C levels. The recommendation to initiate statins for secondary prevention is based on strong evidence in which benefit far exceeds risk.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — age-focused synopsis states that young adults 20 to 39 years should prioritize estimating lifetime risk and healthy lifestyle, with drug therapy only for select patients with moderately high LDL-C (≥ 160 mg/dL) or very high LDL-C (≥ 190 mg/dL); adults 40 to 75 years should use 10-year ASCVD risk to guide therapy; and for patients > 75 years, assessment of risk status and a clinician–patient risk discussion determine whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.
