## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening recommendations, specifically who should be screened, how screening is performed, how to monitor detected aneurysms, and how to manage them, with attention to sex-specific issues and differences among guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease burden and why screening matters. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence and guideline hierarchies. Next, I will stratify recommendations by sex, smoking status, and age, and reconcile differences across USPSTF, ACC/AHA, SVS, and ESC. After that, I need to check the screening modality and performance characteristics. Then, I will review surveillance intervals and thresholds for intervention, including sex-specific considerations. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and burden. AAA is typically defined as a maximal infrarenal aortic diameter of 3.0 cm or larger, most are asymptomatic until rupture, and rupture mortality is approximately 75–90%, which underscores the rationale for pre-rupture detection and elective repair when appropriate [^113bVFup] [^115ShLQ7]. Hold on, I should verify the benefit signal from screening trials; meta-analyses of randomized trials show that inviting men aged 65 years and older to one-time ultrasound screening reduces AAA-related mortality and rupture, though all-cause mortality effects are small or null, which frames the magnitude of benefit and informs guideline strength [^1157UoGA] [^1125LHif].

> Next, I should review the guideline hierarchy to anchor recommendations. The USPSTF provides population-level, preventive recommendations with Grades A through D and I statements, whereas ACC/AHA and SVS offer specialty society guidance that often expands indications beyond USPSTF, and ESC reflects European practice patterns. Reconciling these helps avoid over- or under-screening in practice [^113bVFup] [^112Te1Nv] [^1125Xvf3] [^115wKEu6]. Wait, let me verify the key differences; ACC/AHA and SVS are more permissive for family history and sometimes for women with risk factors, while USPSTF is more conservative pending stronger evidence, which will matter for individualized decisions [^112Te1Nv] [^1125Xvf3] [^113bVFup].

> I will now examine the core evidence base. Four large randomized trials in men (e.g. MASS, Western Australia) demonstrate that one-time ultrasound screening reduces AAA-related mortality and emergency operations, with a number needed to invite around 200–300 to prevent one AAA death over long-term follow-up, though all-cause mortality is largely unchanged. This is the backbone of USPSTF's Grade B recommendation for ever-smoking men [^1157UoGA] [^111HxuqY] [^117K2Wn4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the Western Australia trial showed a significant AAA mortality reduction; let me double-check — its rate ratio for AAA mortality was 0.91 and not statistically significant, so I should correct that and rely on pooled analyses for the mortality signal rather than a single trial [^115ZU2xM] [^1157UoGA].

> Now, for men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked, I should confirm the USPSTF stance. The USPSTF gives a Grade B recommendation for one-time ultrasound screening because of moderate certainty of moderate net benefit, with high-quality evidence showing reduced AAA mortality and rupture; this is the strongest population-level endorsement and should be implemented routinely when feasible [^113bVFup] [^114in37w]. Hold on, I should verify test performance; abdominal duplex ultrasound has sensitivity 94–100% and specificity 98–100%, supporting its role as the primary screening modality in primary care settings [^113hE5Gw] [^112ZGqVq].

> For men aged 65–75 who have never smoked, I need to ensure I capture the nuance. USPSTF issues a Grade C recommendation to selectively offer screening rather than routinely screen all, because prevalence is lower and the absolute benefit is smaller. Shared decision-making should weigh modest benefit against small-to-moderate harms from false positives, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary procedures [^113bVFup] [^115qUASX]. Let me consider specialty guidance. ACC/AHA supports screening men with a first-degree family history and suggests considering screening in those under 65 with multiple risk factors, which can reasonably extend screening in carefully selected never-smokers after discussing trade-offs [^112Te1Nv] [^1142KhAb].

> Turning to women, I should confirm that the evidence base is thinner. USPSTF issues a D recommendation against routine screening in women who have never smoked and have no family history, and an I statement for women aged 65–75 who ever smoked or have a family history, citing insufficient evidence to determine net benefit; this reflects lower prevalence and sex-specific uncertainties in rupture risk and operative outcomes [^113bVFup] [^116v4jpV]. But wait, what if we adjust thresholds? Modeling suggests that screening women at age 70 with a lower diagnostic threshold (2.5 cm) and intervention at 5.0 cm could reduce AAA deaths but increases overdiagnosis and remains of uncertain cost-effectiveness, reinforcing the need for better prevalence and quality-of-life data in women before population screening [^112Yht7b] [^114uCfeJ].

> I should double-check the biological rationale for sex-specific considerations. Women have smaller baseline aortic diameters and higher rupture risk at a given diameter, with worse operative mortality, which argues for lower intervention thresholds in some contexts; however, lowering thresholds also risks more overdiagnosis and overtreatment, so individualized decisions and center expertise matter [^113Yw8sV] [^112mPujS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; until randomized screening data in women exist, modeling and expert opinion will continue to guide practice, and some societies reasonably extend screening to high-risk women while acknowledging uncertainty [^112Te1Nv] [^1125Xvf3].

> Next, I should review the screening modality and performance. Conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography is the standard screening test due to high accuracy, safety, and lack of radiation; CT is accurate but not recommended for screening because of radiation, and physical examination is insensitive and not suitable for screening; if ultrasound is technically limited, CT or MRI without contrast may be considered in select scenarios, but ultrasound remains first-line [^112ZGqVq] [^113hE5Gw] [^112YhEdF]. I need to ensure I note that nonradiologist-performed ultrasound achieves acceptable sensitivity and specificity in community programs, supporting broad implementation [^1123ZLnu].

> Let me think about surveillance after a positive screen. For small AAAs, evidence supports surveillance rather than immediate surgery; SVS suggests 3-year intervals for 3.0–3.9 cm, 12-month intervals for 4.0–4.9 cm, and 6-month intervals for 5.0–5.4 cm, with shared decision-making as size approaches 5.5 cm or if rapid growth occurs; early surgery for 4.0–5.4 cm aneurysms has not shown mortality benefit compared with surveillance in trials [^115RjLC2] [^112ZkSxS]. Wait, I should verify growth and rupture risk by size; annual rupture risk is near zero under 4.0 cm, about 1% at 4.0–4.9 cm, and rises to roughly 11% at 5.0–5.9 cm, which aligns with commonly used intervention thresholds in men [^112q3vZr].

> I should confirm the intervention thresholds and preferred modalities. Standard elective repair is generally recommended at 5.5 cm in men, with consideration of repair at 5.0–5.4 cm if rapid growth, symptoms, or high-risk features are present. EVAR is the most common elective approach in the U.S. and has lower perioperative mortality than open repair, though long-term survival is similar, and center volume and outcomes should guide referral [^112q3vZr] [^113J6FXy] [^1179P9z8]. Hold on, I should verify sex-specific thresholds; given higher rupture risk at smaller diameters in women, some experts advocate considering repair at 5.0 cm in appropriate candidates, but this remains debated and should be individualized with attention to anatomy, device suitability, and patient preferences [^113Yw8sV] [^112mPujS].

> For special populations, let me reconsider family history and younger patients. First-degree relatives of patients with AAA have a substantially increased risk, with a stronger signal when the affected relative is female; ACC/AHA and SVS recommend one-time ultrasound screening at age 65–75 for first-degree relatives, and ACC/AHA suggests considering screening under 65 with multiple risk factors or family history, which can be operationalized via EHR prompts or risk tools where available [^114RxGQW] [^112Te1Nv] [^1142KhAb]. I should confirm that these are reasonable extensions beyond USPSTF when counseling patients about potential benefit and harms [^112Te1Nv].

> Regarding implementation, I need to ensure we address uptake and systems. Real-world programs show variable adherence and frequent inappropriate screening outside criteria, but structured reminders and education improve alignment; the SAAAVE Act supports one-time ultrasound for qualifying men within the Welcome to Medicare visit, yet many eligible patients are missed without proactive outreach [^112Cs4Qo] [^117K2Wn4]. But wait, what if we used risk scores? Emerging models and polygenic approaches may refine targeting as prevalence declines, but they require validation before routine adoption; for now, adhering to guideline-concordant screening and surveillance pathways is prudent while monitoring evolving evidence [^111mSLRj] [^117FwCto].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical approach. Screen all men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked once with abdominal ultrasound. Selectively offer screening to men 65–75 who never smoked, especially if they have a first-degree family history or multiple risk factors. Do not routinely screen women who never smoked and have no family history. Consider screening women aged 65–75 who ever smoked or have a family history in shared decision-making, recognizing evidence insufficiency and potential overdiagnosis. Use ultrasound as first-line, surveil small aneurysms per size-based intervals, and refer for elective repair at 5.5 cm in men, with consideration of 5.0 cm in appropriately selected women given higher rupture risk [^113bVFup] [^112Te1Nv] [^115RjLC2] [^112q3vZr] [^113Yw8sV]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines. Yes, this approach reflects USPSTF population-level recommendations while incorporating ACC/AHA and SVS expansions for family history and selected women, and it emphasizes surveillance evidence for small aneurysms to avoid overtreatment [^113bVFup] [^112Te1Nv] [^1125Xvf3].

> Key takeaway: One-time ultrasound screening in ever-smoking men aged 65–75 reduces AAA-related mortality and rupture with favorable cost-effectiveness, whereas screening never-smoking men yields a smaller absolute benefit and should be individualized. For women, routine screening is not recommended, but targeted screening of high-risk women may be reasonable in select contexts pending stronger evidence, and all screen-detected small aneurysms should enter evidence-based surveillance rather than immediate surgery [^1157UoGA] [^116LTfWX] [^113bVFup] [^112Yht7b] [^115RjLC2].

AAA screening is recommended as a **one-time ultrasound** for men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked [^114in37w], with selective screening for never-smokers [^115qUASX]; it is not recommended for women who have never smoked and have no family history [^113q6fWc]. Screening reduces AAA-related mortality and rupture in men [^1157UoGA] [^1125LHif] but offers **no all-cause mortality benefit** [^1157UoGA] [^115ZU2xM] and may lead to unnecessary procedures [^1157UoGA]. Ultrasound is the preferred modality [^112ZGqVq] due to its high accuracy, safety, and cost-effectiveness [^113hE5Gw] [^116LTfWX]. For small AAAs, surveillance is recommended [^115RjLC2], with repair considered at ≥ 5.5 cm or if rapid growth occurs [^112q3vZr].

---

## Definition and epidemiology

An AAA is a **diameter ≥ 3.0 cm** in the abdominal aorta [^115kA9rW]; prevalence is ~1.2–3.3% in men > 60 years [^1163UkYg] and has declined with reduced smoking [^113nbY3j]. Rupture mortality is 75–90% [^115ShLQ7], making early detection critical [^113J6FXy].

---

## Risk factors

- **Age**: ≥ 65 years [^114nsvCC].
- **Sex**: Male [^114nsvCC].
- **Smoking**: Strongest modifiable risk [^notfound].
- **Family history**: First-degree relative with AAA [^114RxGQW].
- **Other vascular aneurysms**: Popliteal or femoral [^116XbLSc].

---

## Screening methods

Ultrasound is **first-line** [^112ZGqVq] for its high sensitivity (94–100%) and specificity (98–100%) [^113hE5Gw], safety, and cost-effectiveness [^116LTfWX]. CT/MRI are reserved for inconclusive ultrasounds or complex anatomy [^112YhEdF].

---

## Evidence supporting screening

Randomized trials show that screening men 65–75 reduces **AAA-related mortality** (OR 0.65) [^1157UoGA] and rupture (OR 0.62) [^1157UoGA] but does not reduce all-cause mortality [^1157UoGA] [^115ZU2xM]. The **number needed to screen** is ~238 to prevent one AAA death over 13 years [^1123ZLnu].

---

## Current screening guidelines

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | - Men 65–75 who ever smoked: screen once (Grade B) [^116FZNY3] <br/> - Never-smokers: selective screening (Grade C) [^116FZNY3] <br/> - Women without smoking/family history: do not screen (Grade D) [^116FZNY3] |
| SVS | - Men/women 65–75 with smoking history: screen [^1125Xvf3] <br/> - First-degree relatives: screen [^112ne5wG] |
| ACC/AHA | - Men ≥ 65 who ever smoked: screen [^1121pMUN] <br/> - First-degree relatives: screen [^112Te1Nv] <br/> - Women ≥ 65 who ever smoked: reasonable [^113JK5Dk] |

---

## Benefits and harms of screening

Benefits include reduced **AAA-related mortality**, rupture, and emergency surgery in men [^1157UoGA] [^1125LHif]. Harms include false positives, anxiety, and unnecessary procedures; **overdiagnosis** can occur, particularly in women [^112Yht7b].

---

## Management of screen-detected AAAs

- **< 3.0 cm**: No routine surveillance [^117BfKyd].
- **3.0–3.9 cm**: Rescreen in 3 years [^115RjLC2].
- **4.0–4.9 cm**: Ultrasound every 12 months [^115RjLC2].
- **5.0–5.4 cm**: Ultrasound every 6 months [^115RjLC2].
- **≥ 5.5 cm or rapid growth**: Refer for repair [^112q3vZr].

---

## Special considerations

Women have **lower prevalence** [^114nGsxK] but higher rupture risk at smaller diameters [^113Yw8sV]; evidence is insufficient for routine screening [^113bVFup], though some guidelines consider it reasonable in smokers or those with a family history [^113JK5Dk] [^1125Xvf3]. Older adults (> 75) generally do not benefit from screening unless they are healthy and have risk factors [^1125Xvf3].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Screening is **cost-effective** in men 65–75 who have ever smoked, with an ICER of ~$16,854/QALY [^116LTfWX]. It is not cost-effective in low-risk women due to low prevalence and high overdiagnosis [^112Yht7b].

---

## Implementation challenges

Implementation challenges include **low uptake** [^115kA9rW], limited awareness, and resource constraints. Strategies to improve uptake include **system-level reminders**, education, and **provider prompts** [^notfound].

---

AAA screening is **recommended for high-risk men** [^114in37w] and reduces AAA-related mortality and rupture [^1157UoGA], but it is not advised for low-risk women [^113q6fWc] because of limited benefit and potential harms [^112Yht7b]. Ultrasound is the preferred test [^112ZGqVq], and detected small AAAs should be surveilled [^115RjLC2], with repair at ≥ 5.5 cm or if rapid growth occurs [^112q3vZr].

### The global and regional prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms: a systematic review and modeling analysis [^112DyyYT]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review, meta-analysis and modeling study was conducted according to a preregistered protocol in PROSPERO (identifier: CRD42020207230). We have reported findings in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelineand the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase to identify sources for the prevalence of AAA in the general population from database inception until October 11, 2021. Search terms used included combinations of keyword and controlled vocabulary terms relating to AAA (eg, "abdominal aorta aneurysm" or "abdominal aortic aneurysm") and prevalence (eg, "prevalence" or "epidemiology"). Full details of the search strategies for the 3 databases are listed in the Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content 1. No language or geographical restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant reviews were also screened.–Gray literature (eg, conference abstracts, unpublished studies, or dissertations) were not searched.

Articles were retained in this review if they were observational studies of the general population and reported crude numbers of AAA cases and sample size, or relevant data (eg, crude prevalence) that allowed recalculation of these crude numbers. To reduce heterogeneity because of inconsistent case definitions, AAA should have been defined as an aortic diameter of 30 mm or greater, screened with ultrasonography or computed tomography. Studies were excluded if they were conducted in specific groups of participants who were deemed as not to be representative of the general population, such as outpatients, people with other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, and hypertension. Experimental studies, case reports, letters, reviews, editorials, and studies without explicit methodological descriptions were excluded. For multiple publications that were based on the same study, we considered the most comprehensive study with the largest sample size or the most recent one.

Two reviewers (Y.H. and P.S.) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified from the bibliographic searches. Full texts of potentially relevant studies were downloaded or requested from authors by online platforms (Researchgate), and further reviewed by the same 2 authors.

All disagreements regarding study eligibility were resolved by consensus through group discussions.

### Long-term outcomes of the Western Australian trial of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115ZU2xM]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Mortality from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remains high. The benefit of screening older men for AAAs needs to be assessed in a range of health care settings.

Objective

To assess the influence of screening for AAAs in men aged 64 to 83 years on mortality from AAAs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial performed from April 1, 1996, through March 31, 1999, with a mean of 12.8 years of follow-up (range, 11.6–14.2 years) included a population-based sample from a single metropolitan region in Western Australia identified via the electoral roll. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2015, to June 1, 2016.

Interventions

Randomization to an invitation to undergo ultrasonography of the abdominal aorta or a control group without invitation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Surgery for and mortality from AAA.

Results

A total of 49 801 men aged 64 to 83 years were identified for the study. Men living too far from screening centers (n = 8671) or who died before invitation (n = 2650) were excluded, resulting in 19 249 men in the invited group and 19 231 controls (mean [SD] age, 72.5 [4.6] years; 95% white). Of 19 249 men invited for screening, 12 203 (63.4%) attended. There were more elective operations (536 vs 414, P < .001) and fewer ruptured AAAs (72 vs 99, P = 0.04) in the invited group compared with the control group. Overall, there were 90 deaths from AAAs in the invited group (mortality rate, 47.86 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 38.93–58.84) and 98 in the control group (52.53 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 43.09–64.03) for a rate ratio of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.68–1.21). For men aged 65 to 74 years, the AAA mortality rate in the invited group was 34.52 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 26.02–45.81) compared with 37.67 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 28.71–49.44) in the control group for a rate ratio of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.62–1.36). The number needed to invite for screening to prevent 1 death from an AAA in 5 years was 4784 for men aged 64 to 83 years and 3290 for men aged 65 to 74 years. There were no meaningful differences in all-cause, cardiovascular, and other mortality risks.

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of the electoral roll to identify and invite men aged 64 to 83 years for screening for AAAs had no significant effect on the overall mortality from AAAs.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — research needs and gaps emphasize that "evidence is insufficient that screening this population confers a net benefit" for "women who smoke or have a family history", call for "appropriately powered RCTs among women with risk factors", need "cohort studies… for persons who initially screen negative… to determine the benefit and timing of additional screening ultrasonography", urge "external validation of risk prediction models", suggest research on thresholds for repair in women because "AAAs in women may rupture at a smaller size than in men", and identify needs for "systems approaches to improving implementation" and studies in "diverse populations (eg, older adults, women, and racial/ethnic groups)".

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nsvCC]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Primary care screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1157UoGA]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have mortality estimated at 81%.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence on benefits and harms of AAA screening and small aneurysm treatment to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher supplied only), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through September 2018. Surveillance continued through July 2019.

Study Selection

Trials of AAA screening benefits and harms; trials and cohort studies of small (3.0–5.4 cm) AAA treatment benefits and harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data. The Peto method was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) for AAA-related mortality, rupture, and operations; the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to pool calculated risk ratios for all-cause mortality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

AAA and all-cause mortality; AAA rupture; treatment complications.

Results

Fifty studies (N = 323 279) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) estimated that a screening invitation to men 65 years or older was associated with a reduction in AAA-related mortality over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57–0.74]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 926]), AAA-related ruptures over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55–0.70]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]), and emergency surgical procedures over 4 to 15 years (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48–0.68]; 5 RCTS [n = 175 085]). In contrast, no significant association with all-cause mortality benefit was seen at 12- to 15-year follow-up (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI 0.98–1.00]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]). One-time screening was associated with significantly more procedures over 4 to 15 years in the invited group compared with the control group (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34–1.55]; 5 RCTs [n = 175 085]). Four trials (n = 3314) of small aneurysm surgical treatment demonstrated no significant difference in AAA-related mortality or all-cause mortality compared with surveillance over 1.7 to 12 years. These 4 early surgery trials showed a substantial increase in procedures in the early surgery group. For small aneurysm treatment, registry data (3 studies [n = 14 424]) showed that women had higher surgical complications and postoperative mortality compared with men.

Conclusions and Relevance

One-time AAA screening in men 65 years or older was associated with decreased AAA-related mortality and rupture rates but was not associated with all-cause mortality benefit. Higher rates of elective surgery but no long-term differences in quality of life resulted from screening.

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^111eP7Ju]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality scoring

A data extraction form, which identified demographic and technical details, and potential biases, in the selected studies, was designed by the reviewers and approved by the full study team. A summary checklist was completed for each study. For four publications, study authors were contacted to request additional information to enable completion of the checklist. Three authors/studies provided the requested data. Quality scoring was undertaken using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cross‐sectional studies 17. Criteria for quality assessment are detailed in the protocol.

The following data were extracted independently by the two reviewers: study design, screening setting (including number of centres) and country, AAA screening start and end dates, screening method, AAA definition, population description of women (including ethnicity, age range, smoking and diabetes), exclusion criteria (particularly when the study excluded non‐screen‐detected/known AAA or previous AAA repairs), number of women invited to be screened, number of women who accepted screening, number of women with AAA (including AAA detection by age and smoking status), and authors' reported limitations of the study.

Data synthesis and analysis

An estimate of the prevalence was made from each study, calculated as the number of women with AAA divided by the number of women who were screened successfully. A 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) for the prevalence in each study was calculated using the score confidence interval 18, 19. Three studies 20, 21, 22 included women younger than 60 years of age in their screening. As the present review excludes younger women, only those aged 60 years and above from these studies were included. A random‐effects meta‐analysis was performed on the logit probability scale (with standard errors transformed using the δ method) using the method of DerSimonian and Laird 23. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic 24. Further exploration of between‐study heterogeneity was investigated by meta‐regression. Results are presented as forest plots.

### Development of a novel scoring tool for the identification of large ≥ 5 CM abdominal aortic aneurysms [^114X587G]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Current screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) target > 3-cm diameter aneurysms in ever-smoking 65- to 75-year-old males. However, more than 50% of AAA ruptures occur in individuals outside this patient cohort, and only a subset of AAAs detected are large enough to warrant surgery. In this analysis, we evaluated more than 3 million screened individuals and developed a scoring tool to identify ≥ 5-cm diameter AAAs in the entire population at risk.

Methods

Between 2003 and 2008, demographics and risk factors were collected from 3.1 million people undergoing ultrasound screening for AAA by Life Line Screening, Inc. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified risk factors and developed a scoring system to predict the presence of ≥ 5-cm diameter AAAs.

Results

Smoking had a profound influence on the risk of AAA, which increased with number of cigarettes smoked and years of smoking, and decreased following smoking cessation. Novel findings included a protective effect of exercise, normal weight, and Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity. Using these and other factors, the scoring system provided good predictive accuracy (C-statistic = 0.82), when tested against the validation subset of the study cohort. The model predicts the presence of 121,000 ≥ 5 cm AAA in the US population (prevalence: 0.14%). Demonstrating the inadequacy of the current screening recommendations, only 35% of these aneurysms were among males aged 65 to 75 years.

Conclusions

Based on the largest cohort of patients ever screened for AAA, we developed a screening strategy that can identify large AAAs in a broad population of individuals at risk.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112c4v1i]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this is the first study to formally assess the long-term benefits, costs, and harms of screening women aged 65 years and older for AAA. Contemporary systematic reviews, original data, clinical trials, and registries were used to obtain woman-specific parameters to feed into a discrete event simulation model for AAA screening, surveillance and intervention. The model estimated the numbers of key screening and clinical events over time for 10 million women enrolled in a screening programme with a UK costs perspective. The flexibility of the model permitted assessment of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of screening women using the same protocol used for the nationwide UK AAA screening programme in men and a range of different scenarios that might be more suitable for women (eg, changing the age at screening, lowering the diagnosis threshold, or reducing the intervention threshold).

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings suggest that a screening programme of women aged 65 years — using the same screening, surveillance, and intervention protocol as defined for men in the UK — would need 3900 women to be invited to screening to save one death from AAA; a third of the screening-detected AAAs would be overdiagnosed and such a programme would not be cost-effective in the UK. The best alternative screening scenario for women would be screening at age 70 years, diagnosis of AAA when the maximum aortic diameter reaches 2.5 cm, and with intervention considered when the AAA diameter reaches 5.0 cm. In this scenario 1800 women would need to be invited to screening to save one death from AAA, but overdiagnosis would occur in more than half of screen-detected AAAs. By contrast, for AAA screening in men aged 65 years, recent estimates have shown that fewer than 700 men need to be screened to avoid one AAA-related death. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether this best alternative scenario in women would be cost-effective because of uncertainty in the key input parameter of AAA prevalence at different ages and a lack of information about the quality of life decrements associated with screening. Therefore, urgent research on the population-based aortic diameter distribution in older women, and on the quality of life decrements associated with screening, is necessary before closing the door on the possibility that in some health-care systems, population screening for AAA in women might be cost-effective.

### Derivation and validation of a 10-year risk score for symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: cohort study of nearly 500 000 individuals [^116MjzNQ]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

An aneurysm is a pathological distension of a section of blood vessel, typically the aorta. – Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta's length, but abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with increased mortality if rupture occurs (around 50% in those who reach the hospital) because of catastrophic bleeding. In the Oxford Vascular Study, among 65- to 74-year-olds, the incidence was 5.5 events per 10 000 person-years in men and 1.1 events per 10 000 person-years in women. Death from AAA accounts for around 2% of all deaths in men aged 65 and over, and few clinical symptoms are noted in AAA that subsequently rupture.

In the United Kingdom, a routine screening program invites men in the year of their 65th birthday for abdominal ultrasonography, and more recent updates suggest women of age 70 years and over be screened if they have risk factors such as ever smoking, or if they have cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or a family history of AAA. If an AAA of > 5.5 cm diameter is detected, the patient is rapidly referred for surgical intervention, with slower referral for smaller-sized AAA. In 2019, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. The USPSTF recommends against routine screening in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA and states that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against AAA screening in women with either history of smoking or family history of AAA. Although not all international recommendations agree on a precise screening strategy, others are broadly similar. Screening for AAA in women has not been demonstrated to be clinically effective. In considering balancing the risks and benefits of screening, ultrasonography itself has high sensitivity (94%–100%) and specificity (98%–100%) for the detection of AAA, although risk and benefits of surgical intervention for smaller aneurysms must be carefully considered. Although age-based screening thresholds in women may not be cost-effective, a more refined risk score based on systematic routine clinical data may help improve clinical care.

This study aimed to use a large, well-phenotyped United Kingdom database to develop, and internally validate, an AAA risk score using simple clinical data. It was hypothesized that such a risk score could more precisely discriminate those at risk of adverse outcomes from AAA than current approaches.

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^111AB2Cs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines 16, and registered in May 2015 in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42015020444). The review protocol was reviewed externally (F. Lederle, Veterans Administration Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). The aim was systematically to review published and unpublished data of the current (since 2000) prevalence of AAA in women, detected by either ultrasonography or CT (aortic diameter 3.0 cm or greater).

MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases were searched, using a combination of controlled vocabulary (medical subject heading (MeSH) or Emtree ®) terms and free‐text terms in ProQuest Dialog™, and limiting the search to data published since 2000. The search was restricted to major European languages, and used the following terms: abdominal aortic aneurysm, women/gender/sex/women's health/sex difference, genetic predisposition, prevalence/incidence/occurrence/frequency, screening, population/population‐based. The final search date was 13 January 2016. Current Controlled Trials (/) and the National Research Register (UK) were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished trials. This search was complemented by scanning reference lists of relevant articles, and manual searches of Endovascular Today and vascular surgery conference proceedings.

### Systematic review of guidelines on abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^114as8T4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Usually, physicians base their practice on guidelines, but recommendations on the same topic may vary across guidelines. Given the uncertainties regarding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening, physicians should be able to identify systematically and transparently developed recommendations. We performed a systematic review of AAA screening guidelines to assist physicians in their choice of recommendations.

Methods

Guidelines in English published between January 1, 2003 and February 26, 2010 were retrieved using MEDLINE, CINAHL, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the National Library for Health, the Canadian Medication Association Infobase, and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. Guidelines developed by national and international medical societies from Western countries, containing recommendations on AAA screening were included. Three reviewers independently assessed rigor of guideline development using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Two independent reviewers performed extraction of recommendations.

Results

Of 2415 titles identified, seven guidelines were included in this review. Three guidelines were less rigorously developed based on AGREE scores below 40%. All seven guidelines contained a recommendation for one-time screening of elderly men by ultrasonography to select AAAs ≥ 5.5 cm for elective surgical repair. Four guidelines, of which three were less rigorously developed, contained disparate recommendations on screening of women and middle-aged men at elevated risk. There was no agreement on the management of smaller AAAs.

Conclusions

Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat AAAs ≥ 5.5 cm. For other target groups and management of small AAAs, prediction models and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to provide guidance.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^112Qp8BV]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

1, 2 It is important to consider potential screening strategies for AAA because most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death is as high as 75% to 90%. 1, 2 DETECTION Evidence is adequate that ultrasonography is a safe and accurate screening test for AAA. BENEFITS OF DETECTION AND EARLY TREATMENT Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Ever Smoked. Four large, population-based, randomized, controlled trials show that invitation to one-time screening for AAA is associated with reduced AAA-specific mortality in men. This benefit begins 3 years after testing and persists up to 15 years. 1, 2 In addition, risk reduction for AAA rupture and emergency surgery persists up to 10 to 13 years. 1, 2. Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Never Smoked. Screening men overall reduces AAA-specific death, rupture, and emergency surgery.

However, the lower prevalence of AAA in men who have never smoked 5 substantially reduces the absolute benefit. Adequate evidence shows that one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography results in a small benefit in men ages 65 to 75 years who have never smoked. Screening in Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Never Smoked. Despite the demonstrated benefits of screening for AAA in men overall, the lower prevalence of AAA in male never-smokers versus male ever-smokers suggests that clinicians should consider a patient's risk factors and the potential for harm before screening for AAA rather than routinely offering screening to all male never-smokers. Current Practice. Screening for AAA is provided as part of the "welcome-to-Medicare visit" for women who have a family history of AAA.

17 However, the evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women. SCREENING METHODS Conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography was the primary method used in the available trials of AAA screening. Primary care physicians and vascular surgeons widely accept abdominal duplex ultrasonography as the standard approach. Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive and easy to do and has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting AAA.

### Analysis of the differences between the ESVS 2019 and NICE 2020 guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116uJvSB]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim was to understand why two recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2020 guidelines and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2019 guidelines, have discordant recommendations in several important areas.

Methods

A review of the approach, methodology, and evidence used by the two guideline committees was carried out to understand potential reasons for their differing recommendations in their two final published guidelines.

Results

NICE guidelines use a multidisciplinary committee to address a limited number of prospectively identified questions, using rigorous methods heavily reliant on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) supported by in house economic modelling, with the purpose of providing the best, cost-effective health care in the UK in 46 main recommendations. The ESVS guidelines use an expert committee to encourage clinical effectiveness across a range of European health economies. ESVS guideline topics, but not questions, are prospectively identified, assessment of evidence was less rigorous, and 125 recommendations were made. More up to date evidence searches by the ESVS committee partially underscore the differences in recommendations for screening women. The NICE committee did not consider sex specific analysis or evidence for thresholds for intervention but relied on sex specific modelling to support their advice to use endovascular repair (EVAR) for ruptures in women. Their recommendation to use open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men aged < 71 years was based on in house economic modelling. NICE recommends an open first strategy for non-ruptured AAA mainly based on earlier RCTs and UK specific economic modelling, while the ESVS guidelines recommend an EVAR first strategy after consideration of modern, but lower quality, evidence from observational studies. Similar reasons explain differences in the recommended treatments of juxtarenal aneurysms.

Conclusion

Differences between the NICE and ESVS guidelines can be explained, at least in part, by their differing perspectives, methodologies, and quality assurance. Future ESVS guidelines may benefit from more multidisciplinary input and prospectively identified questions.

### Risk factor-targeted abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: systematic review of risk prediction for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111mSLRj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. In England and Wales each year, AAA rupture causes over 3000 deaths and more than 7000 patients undergo surgical AAA repair to prevent rupture.

Risk prediction models can be used to calculate the probability that an individual has a certain pathology or disorder; prognostic models work similarly to predict the probability or risk of future occurrence of a particular pathology or outcome. In healthcare, these models often use information about a patient's demographics and associated co-morbidities to calculate the person's risk/prognosis.

Multiple trials have confirmed the long-term effectiveness of screening in reducing the risk of dying from ruptured AAA. In the UK, the NHS AAA screening programme has been established since 2009, offering men in their 65th year a one-off ultrasound examination to screen for AAA. Currently the programme detects an aneurysm in less than 1% of the men screened, and this number is expected to drop further in the future. As disease prevalence falls over time, screening will become less and less cost-effective. Targeted screening has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of existing population-based AAA screening programmes. Any targeted screening strategy is likely to be based, at least in part, on AAA risk factors. In the USA, a targeted screening strategy for AAA has been established since 2005. In this programme, men aged 65–75 years who have a history of smoking are recommended for screening with ultrasound imaging.

Electronic healthcare records (EHRs), such as those that exist in primary care or hospitals, offer an opportunity to apply clinical prediction models for screening, based on multiple risk factors (provided that these risk factors are recorded/detected in such records).

The aim of this review was to investigate the current state of risk prediction for AAA in the literature, identifying and comparing published models, and describing their performance and applicability to targeted screening strategies using EHR-based populations.

For men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, Grade C says to "Selectively offer screening to men who do not have a history of smoking, rather than routinely screening all men in this group". For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, Grade D advises, "Do not screen women who have never smoked and do not have a family history of AAA". For women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, the USPSTF issues an I statement: "Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA". This recommendation applies to "Asymptomatic adults"; abdominal duplex ultrasonography is "the standard approach for AAA screening", screening is "One-time", and "Ever-smoker" is commonly defined as "smoking 100 or more cigarettes".

### Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score-stratified screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^117FwCto]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta to greater than 3 cm diameter. To promote early detection and management of AAA (which reduces the likelihood of fatal aortic ruptures), authorities in the UK, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway, offer screening to all men aged 65. By contrast, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a one-off screening with ultrasound scan (USS) in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked and recommends selective screening based on clinical judgement in men who have never smoked. However, despite the introduction of such screening programmes, ruptured AAA continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality, exemplified by AAA's contribution to around 0.8% of deaths in men aged 65 and older and 0.4% in women aged 65 and older in England and Wales.

Rupture of AAAs occurs primarily in people not captured by current screening programmes. They include, for example women, men under 65, men invited to screening at 65 but who did not attend, and men with a normal aortic ultrasound scan at age 65 but who develop an AAA later in life. A small number of ruptures also occur in screen-detected AAAseither prior to reaching the threshold for elective intervention, whilst waiting for this intervention, or after being declared unfit for intervention. However, the prevalence of AAA is falling over time. For example, less than 1% of men screened as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS) abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme (NAAASP) in 2021 were observed to have an AAA. By contrast, the prevalence of AAA was 4.9% in the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS), carried out in 1997–9. This temporal decline in the population burden of AAA suggests that the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening may also be changing, encouraging consideration and evaluation of more targeted screening approaches. The USPSTF has, for example, highlighted that research is needed to define the benefits of screening in particular subgroups, suggesting that a stratified approach may have net benefit over current strategies. One potential subgroup is current cigarette smokers, for whom a strong association with AAAhas been reported (7-fold increase in risk in men, and 15-fold in women).

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease: similarities and differences among cardiovascular guidelines and NICE guidance [^111ujFQh]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has improved abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management over the past 2 decades. Different cardiovascular societies worldwide have recommended the endovascular approach as the standard of care in their currently available guidelines. While endovascular treatment has established its role in daily clinical practice, a new debate has arisen regarding the indications, appropriateness, limitations, and role of open surgery. To inform this debate, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020; the systematic search identified 5 articles published between 2011 and 2020 by 4 cardiovascular societies and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Four debatable domains were assessed and analyzed: diagnostic methods and screening, preoperative management, indications and treatment modalities, and postoperative follow-up and endoleak management. The review addresses controversial proposals as well as widely accepted recommendations and "gray zone" issues that need to be further investigated and analyzed, such as screening in women, medical management, and follow-up imaging. While the recommendations for AAA management have significant overlap and agreement among international cardiovascular societies, the NICE guidelines diverge regarding the role of open repair in aortic disease, recommending conventional surgery in most elective cases.

Importance — definition, prevalence, and rupture risk indicate that an AAA is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger; population-based studies in men older than 60 years have found an AAA prevalence ranging from 1.2% to 3.3%; previous prevalence rates of AAA reported in population-based screening studies ranged from 1.6% to 2.7% of the general population 60 to 65 years or older; and although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

### Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in high-risk women [^111vyTJ4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening protocol

Screening consisted of a single ultrasound scan of the abdominal aorta with images captured in two planes at the largest diameter identified. An AAA was defined as a maximal aortic size 3.0 cm or greater from inner edge to inner edge, as per established international guidance. The full ultrasound protocol is detailed in the Supplementary material.

Following screening, there were five possible outcomes all of which were detailed in an outcome letter sent to the patient's primary care practitioner. All aortas measuring 2.5 cm or greater were classified as 'abnormal' and those with measuring less than 2.5 cm as 'normal' An AAA was defined as 3.0 cm or greater. Women who screened normal were reassured and discharged. Those whose aorta could not be visualized were offered a second (repeat) scan at their primary care practice. If the aorta could still not be visualized they were referred to the University Hospitals of Leicester Vascular Studies Unit. Those with aortas between 2.5 cm and 2.9 cm were booked for a 5-year follow-up aortic ultrasound scan at their regional hospital vascular unit. The long-term clinical benefit of surveillance in this 'sub-aneurysmal' group is unknown but some studies have demonstrated a significant proportion will become aneurysmal within 5 years. Women diagnosed with an AAA from 3.0–5.4 cm were offered cardiovascular risk factor modification advice, provided with an appointment with the local vascular unit for clinical assessment, and entered into follow-up with the local vascular surgery service. Surveillance scans were planned in accordance with NAAASP protocols for male AAA surveillance.

Women with an AAA measuring 5.5 cm or greater were referred to their local vascular surgery unit for consideration of surgical repair.

Discussion

Comprehensive modelling has shown that offering women screening for AAA, using the same screening protocol as for men in the UK, would reduce deaths from AAA in the UK by 7% in women aged from 65 to 75 years and by 3% in women aged from 65 to 95 years, would require 3900 screening invitations to avoid one AAA-death, and would be unlikely to be cost-effective. The best alternative screening strategy was based on screening at age 70 years, giving a reduction of 12% in AAA-related deaths at age 70–80 years and by 8% at age 70–95 years, reducing both the number of screening invitations needed to prevent one AAA-death to 1800 and the ICER to £23 000 but with an overdiagnosis rate of more than 50%. This is in stark contrast to AAA screening in men, for which less than 700 men need to be invited to screening to avoid one AAA-death, and for which contemporary modelling, on the basis of current AAA prevalence in the UK, estimates screening to reduce AAA-related deaths by 18% from age 65 to 75 years and by 6% from age 65 to 95 years with a corresponding ICER of £7400.

Recommendations for aneurysm screening — Randomized trials of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening showed benefit: four trials including 127,891 men and 9342 women aged 65 to 79 years found ultrasound screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality, with benefit beginning within 3 years and persisting up to 15 years, and screening was associated with reduced risk for AAA rupture and emergency surgery. In the MASS trial over 13 years there was a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality, an estimated 216 men needed to be invited to screening to save one death during 13 years, and roughly half of ruptures had an initial diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2005 recommended a one-time abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and in 2014 updated to one-time screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked (grade B) with selective screening for those who have never smoked (grade C); screening was not recommended for women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufficient for women aged 65 to 75 years with a smoking history. In the absence of a smoking history, prevalence drops to 2%; among women of similar age with a past smoking history prevalence is 0.8%, in current smokers prevalence is 5%, and in women who have never smoked AAA prevalence is < 0.60%. Under the SAAAVE amendment, Medicare began offering one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes and for men and women with a family history of AAA disease as part of the Welcome to Medicare exam, and originally the order could be placed only by the primary care physician within 6 months of activation of Medicare benefits.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines are the most widely used criteria for screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). However, when the USPSTF criteria are applied retrospectively to a group of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA, there are many patients who satisfy none of the AAA screening criteria. The more sensitive Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines have expanded the criteria for screening for AAA with the hope of capturing a greater fraction of those individuals who can undergo treatment for their AAA before presenting with AAA rupture. We sought to identify the number of patients who would have been identified as having criteria for screening for AAA by both the USPSTF and SVS criteria, in a cohort of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA.

Methods

We assessed demographic, comorbidity, and perioperative complication data for all patients undergoing endovascular and open AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative. Patients meeting each of the screening criteria were identified. Clinical factors and demographic variables were collected.

Results

We identified 55,197 patients undergoing AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative, including 44,602 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and 10,595 patients undergoing open repair. Of these, the USPTF guidelines would have identified fewer than one-third of patients (32% EVAR and 33% open repair). Applying the SVS guidelines increased the number meeting criteria for screening by 6% and 12% for the EVAR and open repair cohorts, respectively. Finally, adoption of the expanded SVS guidelines (including the "weak recommendations") would have identified an additional 34% of EVAR patients and 21% of open AAA repair patients. Use of the expanded criteria would have resulted in 27% of patients undergoing EVAR and 33% of patients undergoing open AAA repair who would not have met any screening criteria. In EVAR patients not meeting the criteria, 52% were younger than 65 years had a history of heavy smoking. Of all those who did not meet screening criteria, ruptured AAA was twice as prevalent as those who met screening criteria (8.5% vs 4.4%; P ≤ .0001).

Conclusions

Expanding established USPSTF screening guidelines to include the expanded SVS criteria may potentially double the number of patients identified with AAA. Smokers under the age of 65, and elderly patients 70 and older with no smoking history, represent two groups with AAA and potentially twice the risk of presenting with rupture.

USPSTF abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening rationale — by sex, smoking, and family history: Ultrasonography is described as "a safe and accurate screening test for AAA". In men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked, "1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography results in a moderate benefit", the harms "are small to moderate", and there is "moderate certainty" this "has a moderate net benefit". In men aged 65 to 75 who have never smoked, screening yields "a small benefit", with harms "small to moderate", and "moderate certainty" of "a small net benefit". For women who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, there is "inadequate evidence to conclude whether 1-time screening… is beneficial", and "the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined". For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, "1-time screening… results in no benefit", and "the harms of screening… outweigh the benefits".

### The case for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113nbY3j]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are re-evaluating their screening paradigms for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Currently, most countries that screen for AAA do so only in male ever-smokers between the ages of 65 and 75 years and in patients with a family history of AAA. However, these recommendations are based primarily on screening trials predating the endovascular era. The wider applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair and its safety profile, especially in the elderly, have changed the risk-benefit of repair and, by extension, screening. This is despite the decreasing prevalence of AAA thanks to improved medical therapies and lower smoking rates. This evidence summary critically examines the evidence behind screening and the potential for expanded screening.

### Screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysms: who needs it and when [^11783CRq]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms potentially can save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. Screening programs, however, have yet to be proven as an efficient means of accomplishing this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option. Recently, 2 large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be followed up at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Should the frequency of surveillance for small abdominal aortic aneurysms be reduced? [^112Pq3Pb]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Different national screening programmes use a variety of surveillance intervals for patients identified with small abdominal aortic aneurysm. An individual patient meta-analysis of > 15000 persons with small aneurysm has provided a strong scientific basis for safe surveillance frequency. In many screening programmes the number of surveillance visits for men could be reduced by up to half. The higher rate of aneurysm rupture in women leads to different recommendation for women.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111poq8W]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

There would be no quick answers from doing a randomised trial of AAA screening in women, because of the large sample size and long-term follow-up that would be required. The alternative is long-term modelling. This requires contemporary and reliable estimates of parameters that can influence the clinical and cost-effectiveness of screening in women. The aim of this project was to obtain this information and then apply discrete event simulation modelling to explore the hypothesis that a variation of the current AAA screening programmes for men might prove clinically beneficial and cost-effective in reducing deaths from ruptured AAA in women.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Historically, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been considered to be a disease in older male smokers, with prevalence being 4–5 times higher in men than in women. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL using the terms "abdominal aortic aneurysm", "aneurysm", "women" OR "gender" OR "sex" OR "women's health" OR "sex difference", "prevalence" OR "incidence" OR "occurrence" OR "frequency", "screening", and "population" OR "population-based". The search was restricted to major European languages and the final search date was Jan 15, 2017. Four randomised trials of population screening in older men have shown that screening can reduce AAA-related deaths by up to half, meta-analysis of these trials indicate a small decrease in all-cause mortality, and associated studies have shown that screening is cost-effective. Therefore, in many countries or regions, there are programmes for ultrasonographic AAA screening for men. In women, AAA screening is not recommended as there has been only a single underpowered randomised trial to date. However, the rupture rate of small AAAs is four times higher in women than in men, and a third of the deaths from AAA rupture are in women. Moreover, women with incidentally detected AAA are disadvantaged with respect to availability of elective repair, the types of treatment available, and the higher elective operative mortality and complication rates compared with men. Although the effect of AAA screening on quality of life has been assessed in men, the instruments used might not be sensitive to detect either small changes or changes in specific health domains such as depression and emotional status and, to our knowledge, there have been no studies in women to date.

Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ≥ 5.5 cm. However, the recommendations regarding other age groups, imaging intervals for small AAAs, inclusion of women, and cost-effectiveness have not been universally adopted. As many countries are considering the initiation of an AAA screening program, this is an overview on the current status of such programs.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) traditionally has been considered a disease of men, strongly associated with smoking. However, a third of deaths caused by AAA rupture are in women. In men, synthesis of four randomised trials has shown a benefit of population-based screening in reducing AAA-related mortality by up to 40% although any reduction in all-cause mortality is small. Several countries including Sweden and the UK have introduced cost-effective population screening programmes for AAA in men aged at least 65 years, and screening for older men is available in the USA, and regionally in Italy and other countries. The only randomised trial of AAA screening in women, which was done in the 1990s, was underpowered. In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against screening in women. The reasons for this recommendation include the reportedly lower prevalence of AAA in women, on the basis of the maximum aortic diameter threshold of at least 3 cm, and paucity of evidence about the management of AAA in women. However, with long-term health-economic modelling in men suggesting that population-based screening would be cost-effective with an AAA prevalence as low as 0.35–0.5%, smoking now almost as common in women as in men, and with the association between smoking and AAA almost twice as strong for women compared with men, the case for AAA screening in women needs to be formally assessed.

### Population-based study of incidence of acute abdominal aortic aneurysms with projected impact of screening strategy [^114AAgBE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The increase in life expectancy and the consequent rapid and ongoing increase in the elderly population have important implications for the effective targeting of preventive medicine. A key issue for screening and prevention of vascular disease is the extent to which disease incidence is also moving to older ages. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) cause over 175 000 deaths globally, accounting for 1% of deaths in men over 65 years. Rupture carries an 80% mortality,–compared with only a 2% to 6% 30-day mortality for elective surgical repair of screen-detected AAAs, suggesting that population screening to detect and repair AAAs before rupture may reduce mortality. In fact, the UK Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS), showed that ultrasound screening of men ages 65 to 74 halved 10-year AAA-related mortality and national screening programs have recently been initiated for men age 65 in England(national implementation completed April 2013), Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Sweden. In the United States, following the Preventive Services Task Force recommendation, Medicare screening of men age 65 who have ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes has also commenced under the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act (2007).

The MASS trial, carried out in the UK from 1997 to 1999, estimated that screening of all men age 65 would be cost-effective, with 1 death prevented per 216 men invited to screening. However, this estimate was based on a 4.9% prevalence of AAAs in men ages 65 to 74 in the trial cohort, whereas early results from the National Health Service (NHS) screening programsuggest a 1.5% AAA prevalence in screened men age 65, with similar findings reported in Swedenand New Zealand. This, together with evidence suggesting that the greatest decline in AAA events and mortality has been in the younger age groups, suggests that the incidence of rupture may be shifting to older age groups.–Although one-off screening of men at age 65 is a major step in preventing acute AAA, these findings raise concerns that it may have a limited impact on overall AAA-related mortality at the population level, particularly in light of increasing life expectancy and the limited duration (10 to 15 years) of "protection" afforded by screening.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112Yht7b]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

A third of deaths in the UK from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are in women. In men, national screening programmes reduce deaths from AAA and are cost-effective. The benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness in offering a similar programme to women have not been formally assessed, and this was the aim of this study.

Methods

We developed a decision model to assess predefined outcomes of death caused by AAA, life years, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a population of women invited to AAA screening versus a population who were not invited to screening. A discrete event simulation model was set up for AAA screening, surveillance, and intervention. Relevant women-specific parameters were obtained from sources including systematic literature reviews, national registry or administrative databases, major AAA surgery trials, and UK National Health Service reference costs.

Findings

AAA screening for women, as currently offered to UK men (at age 65 years, with an AAA diagnosis at an aortic diameter of ≥ 3.0 cm, and elective repair considered at ≥ 5.5cm) gave, over 30 years, an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £30000 (95% CI 12000–87000) per quality-adjusted life year gained, with 3900 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-related death and an overdiagnosis rate of 33%. A modified option for women (screening at age 70 years, diagnosis at 2.5 cm and repair at 5.0 cm) was estimated to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £23000 (9500–71000) per quality-adjusted life year and 1800 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-death, but an overdiagnosis rate of 55%. There was considerable uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness ratio, largely driven by uncertainty about AAA prevalence, the distribution of aortic sizes for women at different ages, and the effect of screening on quality of life.

Interpretation

By UK standards, an AAA screening programme for women, designed to be similar to that used to screen men, is unlikely to be cost-effective. Further research on the aortic diameter distribution in women and potential quality of life decrements associated with screening are needed to assess the full benefits and harms of modified options.

Results

Using the same screening protocol as for 65-year-old men in NAAASP, screening detected AAA in 0.31% of the population resulting in 23% more AAAs detected in total from age 65 to 95 years, leading to an additional 452 elective operations per 1 million women invited to screening, 21% more than predicted to occur under no screening (table 1). Most of these additional operations occurred between the ages of 67 and 77 years (figure 1A, appendix). By contrast, there were 97 (4%) of 2336 fewer emergency operations (appendix), and 396 (4%) of 9235 fewer AAA ruptures, predominantly occurring after age 70 years (figure 1A). Approximately half of the AAA ruptures in the group invited to screening occurred in women with aortic diameter of less than 3 cm at initial screening (appendix). There were 85 (7%) of 1269 fewer AAA-related deaths in the first 10 years after screening and 257 (3%) of 8388 fewer deaths overall from age 65 to 95 years. For every four women who avoided an AAA-death because of successful screening, one woman died due to additional elective repair (342 avoiding AAA-related deaths because of screening vs 85 deaths caused by elective surgery after screening; table 1). There was an early negative effect of screening on deaths due to AAA because of the high operative mortality for elective repair, particularly since less than half of the repairs in women aged younger than 75 years used EVAR (figure 1B). Overall, 3900 women would need to be invited to screening to prevent one AAA-related death.

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^113LowKX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The data for the contemporary prevalence of AAA in women should be considered in the context of the ongoing debate about whether AAAs in women are diagnosed and treated adequately. If AAA screening in 65‐year‐old men is cost‐effective down to a prevalence rate as low as 0.35 per cent 39, AAA screening also may be cost‐effective in 70‐year‐old women, especially as the AAA rupture rate in women is about four times that in men for a given AAA diameter 40. Indeed, a modelling study from Sweden 41 has already suggested that AAA screening for older women would be cost‐effective, based on an AAA prevalence of 1.1 per cent in 65‐year‐old women.

Present guidelines for AAA screening in women are only that it is not recommended for older women who have never smoked 37. This contemporary review, showing a pooled prevalence of 0.74 per cent in women aged at least 60 years, rising to over 1.0 per cent in ever smokers and those aged 70 years or older, might stimulate the debate about offering targeted AAA screening to older women.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1125LHif]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is found in 5% to 10% of men aged 65 to 79 years. The major complication is rupture which presents as a surgical emergency. The mortality after rupture is high, 80% for patients reaching hospital and 50% for those undergoing surgery for emergency repair. Currently elective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms discovered to be larger than 5.5 cm to prevent rupture. There is interest in population screening to detect, monitor and repair abdominal aortic aneurysms before rupture.

Objectives

To determine the effects of screening asymptomatic individuals for AAA on mortality, subsequent treatment, quality of life and cost effectiveness of screening.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Trials Register (last searched 26 January 2007) and CENTRAL (last searched Issue 1, 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of population screening for AAA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Four studies involving 127,891 men and 9,342 women were included in this review. Only one study included women. Results for men and women were analysed separately. Three to five years after screening there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between screened and unscreened groups for men or women (men, odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.07; for women OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21). There was a significant decrease in mortality from AAA in men (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78), but not for women (OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.36 to 10.88). In this analysis mortality includes death from rupture and from emergency or elective surgery for aneurysm repair. There was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.99) but not in women (OR 1.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 8.94). There was a significant increase in surgery for AAA in men (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.59 to 2.59). This was not reported in women. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or subjective quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence of a significant reduction in mortality from AAA in men aged 65 to 79 years who undergo ultrasound screening. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit in women. The cost effectiveness may be acceptable, but needs further expert analysis. These findings need careful consideration in judging whether a co-ordinated population-based screening programme should be introduced.

We suggest a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs in men or women older than 75 years with a history of tobacco use and in otherwise good health who have not previously received a screening ultrasound examination.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1179P9z8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30–30–30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^11666rEN]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

A third of deaths in the UK from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are in women. In men, national screening programmes reduce deaths from AAA and are cost-effective. The benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness in offering a similar programme to women have not been formally assessed, and this was the aim of this study.

Methods

We developed a decision model to assess predefined outcomes of death caused by AAA, life years, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a population of women invited to AAA screening versus a population who were not invited to screening. A discrete event simulation model was set up for AAA screening, surveillance, and intervention. Relevant women-specific parameters were obtained from sources including systematic literature reviews, national registry or administrative databases, major AAA surgery trials, and UK National Health Service reference costs.

Findings

AAA screening for women, as currently offered to UK men (at age 65 years, with an AAA diagnosis at an aortic diameter of ≥ 3.0 cm, and elective repair considered at ≥ 5.5cm) gave, over 30 years, an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £30 000 (95% CI 12 000–87 000) per quality-adjusted life year gained, with 3900 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-related death and an overdiagnosis rate of 33%. A modified option for women (screening at age 70 years, diagnosis at 2.5 cm and repair at 5.0 cm) was estimated to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £23 000 (9500–71 000) per quality-adjusted life year and 1800 invitations to screening required to prevent one AAA-death, but an overdiagnosis rate of 55%. There was considerable uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness ratio, largely driven by uncertainty about AAA prevalence, the distribution of aortic sizes for women at different ages, and the effect of screening on quality of life.

Interpretation

By UK standards, an AAA screening programme for women, designed to be similar to that used to screen men, is unlikely to be cost-effective. Further research on the aortic diameter distribution in women and potential quality of life decrements associated with screening are needed to assess the full benefits and harms of modified options.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113bVFup]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0–5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAbdominal aortic aneurysm follow-up (without repair) [^1115oNij]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta to 3 cm or greater. A high degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with AAA rupture, and imaging surveillance plays an essential role in mitigating the risk of rupture. Aneurysm size and growth rate are factors associated with the risk of rupture, thus surveillance imaging studies must be accurate and reproducible to characterize aneurysm size. Ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography provide an accurate and reproducible assessment of size, while radiographs and aortography provide limited evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and cost [^116LTfWX]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) can cause significant mortality when ruptured but are often undiagnosed before this time. Population screening of high-risk individuals and early intervention may mitigate AAA-related mortality. Large trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit for AAA screening, but adoption is not ubiquitous. This study sought to systematically review and consolidate the most recent randomized trial evidence on AAA screening in men and its cost-effectiveness.

Methods

Randomized trials and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of AAA screening in men were identified from searching Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and relevant citation lists. Data were extracted as hazard ratios or raw event rates. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects, inverse variance weighted model for continuous variables and Mantel-Haenszel weighting for event data. Cost estimates of screening were adjusted for inflation and reported as $US/quality-adjusted life year.

Results

Five studies were identified totaling 175,085 participants (age, 64–83 years) with a mean 10.6 years of follow-up (4.4–13.1). The AAA detection ranged from 3.3 to 7.7%. Screening significantly reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–0.99; P = 0.002), AAA-related mortality (0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.89; P = 0.008), and emergent AAA repair (relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.91; P = 0.02). The number needed to screen to prevent 1 AAA-related death per 10 years ranged from 209 to 769 individuals. Sixteen CEAs found a mean 16,854 $/QALY (range, 266–73,369).

Conclusions

Wider implementation of population-based AAA screening programs in elderly men should be considered as it demonstrates a significant and cost-effective reduction in all-cause mortality as well as AAA-related mortality.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a best-evidence systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113uN5Wx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

While the prognosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is poor, ultrasound imaging is an accurate and reliable test for detecting AAAs before rupture.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of population-based AAA screening.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1994 to July 2004) supplemented by the Cochrane Library, a reference list of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of AAA population screening, population studies of AAA risk factors, and data on adverse screening and treatment events from randomized trials and cohort studies.

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

The authors identified 4 population-based randomized, controlled trials of AAA screening in men 65 years of age and older. On the basis of meta-analysis, an invitation to attend screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.74]). A meta-analysis of 3 trials revealed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.95 to 1.02]). No significant reduction in AAA-related mortality was found in 1 study of AAA screening in women. Screening does not appear to be associated with significant physical or psychological harms. Major treatment harms include an operative mortality rate of 2% to 6% and significant risk for major complications.

Limitations

The population screening studies focused on men and provided no information on racial or ethnic groups. No information was available on uninvited control group characteristics, so the importance of risk factors such as tobacco use or family history could not be assessed. Since all trials were conducted in countries other than the United States, generalizability to the U.S. population is uncertain.

Conclusion

For men age 65 to 75 years, an invitation to attend AAA screening reduces AAA-related mortality.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112q3vZr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

AAA treatment thresholds and rupture risk: Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality, and larger size is associated with increased rupture risk. The annual risk for rupture is "nearly 0%" for AAAs 3.0 to 3.9 cm, "1%" for 4.0 to 4.9 cm, and "11%" for 5.0 to 5.9 cm. Surgical repair is standard for "an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period)". Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the most common elective approach, and "in the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR". The majority of screen-detected AAAs (≥ 90%) are between 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Screening and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^111Awvv2]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

1 What sets AAA apart from more common causes of death is that it is a preventable problem. Ultrasonographic screening for aortic aneurysms is rapid, accurate, and relatively inexpensive. A single normal ultrasound examination in men 65 years or older virtually excludes future risk of AAA-related death. 2 More than 50 years of experience has shown that open surgical repair nearly eliminates the risk of AAA-related death. 3 A recent meta-analysis 4 found that aneurysm screening reduced AAA-related deaths by 43 percent over four to five years in men 65 years and older. In 2005, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a recommendation for one-time aneurysm screening for all men 65 years and older who have ever smoked. The prevalence of aortic aneurysms in women ranges from 0. 6 to

1. 4 percent, or about 15 percent of the prevalence in men. There is also a seven- to 10-year lag in the incidence of aneurysms in women compared with men.

Most AAA-related deaths occur before 80 years of age in men and after 80 years of age in women. Because there is no evidence that screening is beneficial in women, the USPSTF recommended against aneurysm screening in average-risk women. The USPSTF noted that physicians should consider other risk factors when individualizing recommendations for specific patients. The significance of these recommendations was underscored by the recent passage of the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act. Beginning in January 2007, Medicare will provide coverage to new enrollees for one-time ultrasonography in men with a history of smoking and in men and women 65 to 74 years of age with a family history of AAA. Once an AAA is identified, the question is how to proceed. Periodic surveillance every two to three years is warranted for those with 3. 0- to
3. 9-cm AAAs because they rarely rupture. Trials are underway in the United States and Europe to examine this question.

How will physicians, given what is and is not known about interventions for AAA, provide the patient with informed advice about options. The physician should encourage surveillance when it is prudent. When intervention is indicated, surgical repair is still the standard of care. When advising patients about the option of endovascular repair, long-term outcomes from ongoing clinical trials should provide the best guidance for the appropriate role of this intervention.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115ShLQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant vascular disease found in 4% to 8% of the screening population. If ruptured, its mortality rate is between 75% and 90%, and it accounts for up to 5% of sudden deaths in the United States. Therefore, screening of AAA while asymptomatic has been a crucial portion of preventive health care worldwide. Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta is the primary imaging modality for screening of AAA recommended for asymptomatic adults regardless of their family history or smoking history. Alternatively, duplex ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate for screening. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### An international, expert-based, Delphi consensus document on controversial issues in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115CMA8G]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

As a result of conflicting, inadequate or controversial data in the literature, several issues concerning the management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain unanswered. The aim of this international, expert-based Delphi consensus document was to provide some guidance for clinicians on these controversial topics.

Methods

A three-round Delphi consensus document was produced with 44 experts on 6 prespecified topics regarding the management of AAAs. All answers were provided anonymously. The response rate for each round was 100%.

Results

Most participants (42 of 44 [95.4%]) agreed that a minimum case volume per year is essential (or probably essential) for a center to offer open or endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). Furthermore, 33 of 44 (75.0%) believed that AAA screening programs are (probably) still clinically effective and cost effective. Additionally, most panelists (36 of 44 [81.9%]) voted that surveillance after EVAR should be (or should probably be) lifelong. Finally, 35 of 44 participants (79.7%) thought that women smokers should (or should probably/possibly) be considered for screening at 65 years of age, similar to men. No consensus was achieved regarding lowering the threshold for AAA repair and the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing EVAR.

Conclusions

This expert-based Delphi consensus document provides guidance for clinicians regarding specific unresolved issues. Consensus could not be achieved on some topics, highlighting the need for further research in those areas.

### Outcomes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program [^112Cs4Qo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2007, Medicare guidelines were established to identify persons at risk for the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of an AAA screening program in a regional Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.

Methods

Data were extracted from a regional VA health care network identifying all veteran males 65 to 75 years of age who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. In 2007, an AAA screening mandate was implemented allowing patients meeting screening criteria to be evaluated for AAA as part of the patient's health maintenance. AAA is identified as an aortic diameter size of 3.0 cm or greater. Clinician adherence to screening protocols and referral to a vascular surgeon for aneurysms > 5.5 cm were also evaluated.

Results

A total of 9751 patients (71.5 ± 5.6 standard deviation years of age) were screened for an AAA over a 5-year period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. A total of 698 aneurysms (7.1%) were found. Referrals to a vascular surgeon were made on 45 patients with aneurysms > 5.5 cm. Over a 5-year period, a total of 2754 patients (28.2%) were inappropriately screened: 416 patients were under 65 years old, 2243 patients were over 75 years old, 36 patients were women, and 123 patients without aneurysms had multiple screenings. In 2007, during the first year of implementation, 39.2% of patients were inappropriately screened. Over the next 4 years, inappropriate screenings decreased with 33.7% in 2008, 28.6% in 2009, 17.7% in 2010, and 14.3% in 2011.

Conclusions

A large AAA screening program at the VA detects more aneurysms, but at smaller diameters than that published in clinical trials. Over time, the number of inappropriate AAA screenings has continued to decrease, demonstrating greater awareness and application of the AAA screening guidelines by primary care providers. Developing surveillance guidelines for small and medium aneurysms is a potential area for future research.

### A 66-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm: review of screening and treatment [^113J6FXy]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of death. Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to be asymptomatic until the time of rupture, which has a mortality rate of greater than 80%. Therefore, elective repair prior to rupture is preferred if life expectancy is reasonable and the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of repair. Mr F, a 66-year-old man with a 5.2-cm AAA, illustrates the issues surrounding monitoring and treating AAA. Risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking history, and a family history of AAA. Screening for AAA with ultrasound has been shown to prevent rupture, prevent AAA-related death, and be cost-effective. Risk factors for rupture include larger diameter, female sex, and smoking history. Endovascular repair has lower operative mortality and complications and has replaced standard open surgery in more than half of patients. However, long-term survival is similar after endovascular and open surgical repair. Those at risk of AAA who would benefit from repair should undergo screening.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms in women [^113Yw8sV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has long been recognized as a condition predominantly affecting males, with sex-associated differences described for almost every aspect of the disease from pathophysiology and epidemiology to morbidity and mortality. Women are generally spared from AAA formation by the immunomodulating effects of estrogen, but once they develop, the natural history of AAAs in women appears to be more aggressive, with more rapid expansion, a higher tendency to rupture at smaller diameters, and higher mortality following rupture. However, simply repairing AAAs at smaller diameters in women is a debatable solution, as even elective endovascular AAA repair is fraught with higher morbidity and mortality in women compared to men. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the effect of gender on AAA presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we aim to review current controversies over screening recommendations and threshold for repair in women.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112mPujS]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Addressing sex-specific clinical issues might reduce the harms from screening and improve the future clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness estimates for women; these include expanding the use of EVAR in women (to reduce both the non-intervention rate and mortality from elective repair). This should be achievable given that the UK-wide quality improvement programme reduced overall elective in-hospital mortality for AAA repair from 5.4% in 2006 to 2.9% in 2016–17, and that mortality is even lower for elective repair of screen-detected aneurysms (in men).

The best alternative strategy at age 70 years that used woman-specific definitions of AAA (maximum aortic diameter ≥ 2.5 cm) is likely to identify many more aneurysms; however, in over half of these women the AAA would have remained asymptomatic without incidental detection. The concern of overdiagnosis must therefore be recognised. The previous definition of AAA for men (a maximum aortic diameter of ≥ 3 cm) was used in most published studies of AAA prevalence in women, so that prevalence appears to be much lower in women than in men. This is a major driver of the lower cost-effectiveness in women compared with men. In women, the average aortic diameter is smaller than in men, providing reasonable justification for sex-specific diagnosis thresholds, since an aneurysm could be defined by a more than 50% focal increase in arterial diameter.

Nevertheless, screening women at age 70 years, as in the best alternative strategy, means that many of these women would not require intervention during their lifetime. Still, after the intervention threshold is reached, elective repair is recommended for most women as was shown by the relatively low proportion of over-treatment in both the reference case (threshold 5.5 cm) and the best alternative strategy (threshold 5.0 cm). This adds to the debate about whether the threshold for intervention of 5.5 cm, derived from randomised trials in which women were under-represented, could be lowered in women. Women have a four times increased risk of rupture in AAA of less than 5.5 cm diameter for a given AAA diameter compared with men. This risk, together with inspection of the available data for the population distribution of aortic diameters in women, indicates that it would be reasonable to consider lower intervention thresholds in women. A lowered threshold would have the effect of potentially offering elective repair at a younger age, reducing the non-intervention rates and operative mortality.

Results

Of a total of 70 495 men aged 64–75 years, 67 770 were randomized (details in Supplementary Fig. S1). The randomized groups were well balanced in terms of age, geographical area and socioeconomic status. Among the 33 883 men invited to screening, principally in a primary care setting, 27 204 (80.3 per cent) attended. Of the 1334 men (4.9 per cent prevalence) with an AAA detected at the initial scan, 942 (70.6 per cent) had complete clinical follow-up to 13 years according the protocol; about half of the losses occurred during the first 3 years of the trial. Follow-up for mortality was almost complete (97.1 per cent); the remainder (mainly those who had moved abroad) were censored at the time last known to be alive. The mean age of the men in MASS at the end of follow-up was 83 years.

Among the 1334 patients with an AAA detected at screening, 820 had died by the end of follow-up, of whom 477 (58.2 per cent) neither had a ruptured aneurysm nor had undergone AAA repair. Of the 514 who were still alive at the end of follow-up, 216 (42.0 per cent) had not undergone AAA surgery. There were about twice as many elective AAA operations in the invited group as in the control group (600 versus 277), but only half the emergency operations (80 versus 166) (Table 1). The overall 30-day mortality rate after elective surgery was 4.2 per cent (37 of 877); it increased with age at operation (odds ratio per 5 years 1.6, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.9 to 2.9), but did not differ between the invited and control groups (P = 0.403).
