## Question

In adequate vitamin D intake, can contribute to the development of osteoporosis by

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how inadequate vitamin D intake can contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of vitamin D in calcium–phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. Then, I should verify how deficiency perturbs parathyroid hormone signaling and bone turnover. Next, I will examine the clinical consequences for bone mineral density and fracture risk, and finally, I should consider population-specific nuances and the limits of evidence for supplementation in replete individuals.

> Let me first confirm the physiological foundation: vitamin D promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, which are essential for mineralization of newly formed osteoid. When vitamin D is insufficient, fractional calcium absorption falls, lowering serum calcium and triggering compensatory mechanisms that can harm bone if persistent [^1175pj7L] [^1165kh6X].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold concept before I overstate it. I initially thought "below 30 ng/mL" universally defines insufficiency, but I should correct that to align with guideline heterogeneity: many authorities consider < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) deficient and 20–29 ng/mL insufficient, while some expert groups target ≥ 30 ng/mL for patients with osteoporosis. Clinically, the most consistent risk signal emerges when 25(OH)D is below 20 ng/mL, so I will anchor to that range while acknowledging guideline differences [^1144Ymwq] [^116qeCNX] [^1113qXWH].

> I will now examine the parathyroid response. When calcium absorption drops due to low vitamin D, parathyroid hormone rises to increase renal calcium reabsorption, stimulate 1α-hydroxylase to raise 1,25(OH)₂D, and increase bone resorption to restore serum calcium, but chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism accelerates bone turnover with net resorption predominating, especially at cortical sites, thereby reducing bone mass over time [^1165kh6X] [^1175pj7L].

> Hold on, I should verify the histologic and clinical endpoints. Sustained vitamin D deficiency impairs osteoid mineralization and, when severe, produces osteomalacia, while even milder deficiency drives secondary hyperparathyroidism with increased bone turnover and progressive bone loss, culminating in osteoporosis and higher fracture risk in older adults [^1165kh6X] [^1175pj7L].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence linking status to outcomes. Observational and interventional data converge on higher fracture risk with low 25(OH)D, and randomized trials in institutionalized or deficient elders show that vitamin D with calcium reduces hip and some nonvertebral fractures by roughly 10–20%, whereas vitamin D alone in largely replete community populations often shows no fracture reduction, underscoring that benefit is most plausible when baseline deficiency is present and calcium intake is adequate [^1175pj7L] [^1179p7UK] [^115tad9R].

> But wait, what if the population is different? I need to ensure I separate primary prevention in community-dwelling adults from treatment in high-risk or deficient groups, because major guidelines conclude insufficient evidence for routine supplementation to prevent fractures in unselected community adults, whereas correction of deficiency remains standard in patients with osteoporosis or high fracture risk, and in frail or institutionalized elders the benefit signal is stronger when combined with calcium and adherence is high [^114Q6qvz] [^1144fnqQ] [^1175pj7L].

> Let me consider dosing and safety so I don't overgeneralize. Daily vitamin D in the 800–1000 IU range typically achieves serum 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL in most adults, while intermittent high-dose regimens have been associated with increased falls and possibly fractures, so daily lower-dose strategies are preferred when supplementation is indicated, especially in older adults [^111cVBdt] [^116qeCNX].

> I should double-check the calcium piece because it modifies vitamin D effects. Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption, but when total calcium intake is low, the PTH-driven resorption persists, so combined calcium and vitamin D is the regimen most consistently associated with fracture risk reduction in deficient or institutionalized elders, whereas calcium alone or vitamin D alone has weaker or inconsistent effects in community populations [^1175pj7L] [^1179p7UK].

> Putting this together, inadequate vitamin D intake contributes to osteoporosis by reducing intestinal calcium absorption, provoking secondary hyperparathyroidism, accelerating bone turnover with a net increase in resorption, impairing osteoid mineralization, and over time lowering bone mineral density and increasing fracture susceptibility, with the clearest clinical signal in individuals who are vitamin D deficient and in older, institutionalized, or frail populations when deficiency is corrected alongside adequate calcium intake [^1165kh6X] [^1175pj7L] [^1179p7UK].

Inadequate vitamin D intake contributes to osteoporosis by **reducing intestinal calcium absorption** [^1165kh6X], which triggers secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1165kh6X], increases bone resorption, and accelerates bone loss [^1165kh6X] [^113VKrhZ]. Chronic deficiency impairs bone mineralization [^1165kh6X], leading to osteomalacia and higher fracture risk [^1165kh6X] [^114RzyEU]. Clinical trials show that **vitamin D with calcium reduces fracture risk** in deficient older adults [^114RzyEU] [^1179p7UK], whereas vitamin D alone is ineffective in replete populations [^115tad9R] [^111Qyvvh]. Adequate vitamin D intake (800–1000 IU/day) [^111bdQyg] is essential to maintain serum 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL [^116qeCNX] and prevent bone loss, especially in older adults and those with limited sun exposure [^111z9NC4] [^114RzyEU].

---

## Physiological mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency to osteoporosis

### Intestinal calcium absorption

Vitamin D **enhances intestinal calcium absorption** [^111Qyvvh] by inducing calbindin, a calcium-binding protein, thereby maintaining serum calcium within the physiological range. Inadequate vitamin D intake reduces fractional calcium absorption [^113VKrhZ], lowering serum calcium and triggering compensatory mechanisms.

---

### Secondary hyperparathyroidism

When serum calcium drops, parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion increases [^notfound], stimulating renal calcium reabsorption, phosphate excretion, and bone resorption to restore calcium levels. Chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism increases bone turnover [^1165kh6X], leading to net bone loss and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) [^114RzyEU].

---

### Bone mineralization

Vitamin D deficiency impairs osteoid mineralization [^1165kh6X], causing osteomalacia in adults, characterized by soft, poorly mineralized bone matrix. This defective mineralization further compromises bone strength and increases fracture risk [^1179p7UK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

### Observational studies

Observational studies consistently show that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with lower BMD [^111Qyvvh], higher bone turnover, and increased fracture risk [^1175pj7L], particularly in older adults [^1165kh6X].

---

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

RCTs demonstrate that **vitamin D supplementation combined with calcium** [^114RzyEU] reduces fracture risk in older adults, particularly in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient populations [^1173WYpp]. However, vitamin D alone does not consistently reduce fractures in community-dwelling adults with adequate vitamin D status [^115tad9R] [^1165kh6X].

---

### Meta-analyses

Meta-analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation, particularly when combined with calcium, significantly reduces the risk of hip and other nonvertebral fractures in older adults, especially those with low baseline vitamin D levels [^1165kh6X] [^1179p7UK].

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **increased risk** of vitamin D deficiency and, consequently, osteoporosis:

- **Older adults**: Reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D and lower dietary intake [^notfound].
- **Institutionalized individuals**: Limited sun exposure and inadequate intake [^notfound].
- **Individuals with limited sun exposure**: Due to geographic location, cultural practices, or lifestyle [^112bmgjr].
- **Individuals with chronic diseases**: Chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and malabsorption syndromes [^1144Ymwq].

## Recommended vitamin D intake and supplementation guidelines

| **Population** | **Recommended daily intake (IU/day)** | **Serum 25(OH)D target (ng/mL)** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 600–800 IU [^111Wwyny] | 20–30 ng/mL [^114xwr92] |
| Older adults (≥ 65 years) | 800–1000 IU [^116b7jSy] | ≥ 30 ng/mL [^114Hfpqn] |
| Individuals with osteoporosis or at high fracture risk | 1000–2000 IU [^1113qXWH] | 30–50 ng/mL [^1113qXWH] |

---

Supplementation should be **individualized** based on baseline vitamin D status, age, sex, and clinical risk factors [^1179Eu9X]. Routine screening of 25(OH)D levels is not recommended for the general population but may be appropriate for high-risk individuals [^114xwr92].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Assessment**: Evaluate dietary intake, sun exposure, and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency [^1144Ymwq].
- **Supplementation**: Provide vitamin D supplementation to achieve and maintain adequate serum 25(OH)D levels, particularly in high-risk populations [^1113qXWH].
- **Calcium intake**: Ensure adequate calcium intake (1000–1200 mg/day) to support bone health and enhance the benefits of vitamin D supplementation [^1117yH8D].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels periodically, especially in individuals receiving high-dose supplementation or those with underlying medical conditions [^113zRN7e].

---

Inadequate vitamin D intake contributes to osteoporosis by **reducing calcium absorption**, triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism, increasing bone resorption, and impairing bone mineralization. Adequate vitamin D intake, particularly when combined with calcium, is essential for maintaining bone health and preventing fractures, especially in older adults and other high-risk populations [^1175pj7L].

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^112Bc37V]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.

Uncertainties and Future Research Needs

The Committee identified a large number of uncertainties surrounding the DRI values, as well as extensive research needs. A particular priority is rigorous, large-scale, randomized clinical trials to test the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal outcomes, as well as to identify threshold effects and possible adverse effects where present. Elucidating the biology of the diverse effects of vitamin D, as well as effects of sun exposure, adiposity, body composition, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors on these associations, is also of great importance.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

Routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements is not recommended; supplements should only be used when daily targets of calcium and vitamin D are not achieved from dietary sources. Ensure adequate total daily intake of calcium (1,000–1,200 mg) and vitamin D (400–800 IU) as adjunct therapy for all postmenopausal women receiving pharmacologic interventions for osteoporosis.

Research agenda

Despite major progress during the last decades in understanding the role of vitamin D and its metabolites on calcium and bone homeostasis, many important questions remain incompletely answered. There is at least one missing player in our understanding of the role and mechanism of action of the vitamin D system on transepithelial calcium transport in the intestine. The precise role of the vitamin D endocrine system in other calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing systems, such as kidney, placenta, breast, and parathyroid glands, is also still incomplete. The role of 1,25(OH) 2 D production in calcium-transporting or calcium-sensing tissues and its autocrine/paracrine effects should also be defined. Additionally, the precise contribution of the vitamin D system on overall phosphate homeostasis is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the risk factors for the development of nutritional rickets beyond vitamin D deficiency is required, for example, dietary calcium intake, iron deficiency, and genotype. The effect of vitamin D status on skeletal development during fetal life, childhood, and adolescence requires greater clarification. Most RCTs used daily doses of vitamin D between 400 and 1200 IU. The effect of higher doses is not well known. The effect of vitamin D metabolites or analogs on bone structure, turnover, and fracture incidence is not clear. Most trials did not select participants with a low serum 25OHD level. Forthcoming trials should select participants based on low baseline serum 25OHD. Individual participant data meta-analyses should be performed selecting vitamin D–deficient subjects only. It may be worthwhile to model the effects of vitamin D supplementation according to age, sex, residence, baseline serum 25OHD, vitamin D dose, and the addition of calcium supplements. Additionally, specific risk groups should be defined for vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures. To improve the efficacy of vitamin D, the treatment should be targeted to the most vulnerable groups, with the institutionalized group ranking highest.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^112tmTq1]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Are supplements needed?

Use of supplements contributes substantially to total vitamin and mineral intakes at the population level. Intake of vitamin B 6, thiamin, and riboflavin among US adults is at least five times higher from supplements than from foods, and intakes are 15 to 20 times higher for supplements for vitamins B 12 and E. Consequently, supplement use considerably reduces the proportion of the general population with inadequate nutrient intake (box 1).

Box 1
Population nutrient intake — definitions

Estimated average requirement is the daily level of nutrient intake estimated to meet the requirement of half of healthy people in a population
Inadequate nutrient intake — The population prevalence of inadequate intake is estimated as the percentage of the population with nutrient intake below the estimated average requirement
Tolerable upper intake is the highest daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all healthy people in a population. As intake increases above the upper level, the potential risk of adverse effects increases.
Excess intake — The population prevalence of excess intake is estimated as the percentage of the population with nutrient intake above the upper level

This is especially true for vitamins and minerals identified as "shortfall" nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D (fig 2). Despite the high use of supplements, inadequate intakes of micronutrients are still common in high income countries, where dietary patterns are typically energy rich but nutrient poor.

Fig 2
Prevalence of inadequate and excess nutrient intake among US Adults, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014

In low and middle income countries, where specific micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent (eg, of iodine, iron, zinc, and vitamin A), supplementation is recommended when food based approaches such as dietary modification, fortification, or food provision are unable to achieve inadequate intake. In the US and other countries, food fortification and enrichment such as the addition of iodine to salt, vitamin D to milk, and B 1 and B 3 vitamins to refined flour have contributed to the virtual elimination of their syndromes of deficiency (goitre, rickets, beriberi, and pellagra, respectively).

Nondaily supplementation

Intermittent vitamin D dosing usually uses a greater amount to reach equivalent doses with fewer administrations. The rationale of this approach is to enhance adherence and ease management of specific patient groups, such as children and community-dwelling older people. Indeed, low adherence to vitamin D prescription has often been reported, although the topic is controversial. For example, Albrecht et al recently investigated adherence to bone health–promoting lifestyle recommendations concerning osteoporosis status in a cross-sectional database of community-dwelling older adults (aged 65–75 years). In high-risk osteoporosis patients, adherence to vitamin D intake, defined as regular consumption of vitamin D–rich foods and/or vitamin D supplements, was high, ranging from 85% (women) to 93% (men). In contrast, in a cross-sectional study of pediatric outpatients affected by various diseases, Arshad et al found that adherence to vitamin D prescription was quite low, particularly in those with diseases where vitamin D deficiency presents as a high-risk condition.

For these reasons, recurrent and protracted intervals of vitamin D supplementation appear to be an effective and convenient way to achieve and maintain sufficient vitamin D status and to increase patients' adherence, but there is no agreement that treatment simplification with intermittent dosing significantly improves compliance and there is consistent evidence to discourage the use of "megadoses" due to the possible side effects.

### How vitamin D works on bone [^111KPMT9]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is important for the normal development and maintenance of bone. The elucidation of the vitamin D activation pathway and the cloning of the vitamin D receptor have advanced our understanding of the actions of vitamin D on bone. The preponderance of evidence indicates that 1,25(OH)₂D₃ enhances bone mineralization through its effects to promote calcium and phosphate absorption. Although 1,25(OH)₂D₃ stimulates bone resorption in vitro, treatment in vivo can prevent bone loss and fracture through several potential mechanisms. The development of vitamin D analogues has provided new therapeutic options for increasing bone mineral density and reducing fractures.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D requirements: current and future [^1122fbxx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The requirements for vitamin D were last set in 1997 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Intakes were assumed to come from diet, and values were based on achievement of adequate vitamin D status and on observed values to prevent seasonal variations in parathyroid hormone concentrations. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were considered the best indicator of vitamin D adequacy, because the production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is not regulated. Normal ranges were obtained from reference populations, but the values varied widely with age and geographic region. Revised recommendations should take into consideration appropriate functional measures for multiple tissues and disease risks. Vitamin D-calcium interdependencies must be taken into account. Higher intakes of both vitamin D and calcium can reduce bone resorption, and higher concentrations of one nutrient might compensate for insufficiency in the other. Better ways to assess vitamin D (and calcium) inputs are needed. Food composition databases are incomplete for both vitamin D and calcium, especially in this era of food fortification, and are complicated by the poor quality control for vitamin D fortification. Upper levels of vitamin D intake were set at 50 microg/d (2000 IU/d) for all ages. Some individuals would require higher levels than these to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations for optimal calcium absorption. So much new information on vitamin D and health has been collected since the requirements were set in 1997 that this nutrient is likely the most in need of revised requirements.

Recommendations of others — vitamin D and calcium: The Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) and the World Health Organization recommend standards to achieve adequate daily calcium and vitamin D as part of overall health and have no recommendations specific to fracture prevention. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that adults 50 years and older consume 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily. The Endocrine Society recommends that adults 65 years and older consume 800 IU of vitamin D daily for the prevention of falls, and the American Geriatrics Society recommends that adults 65 years and older take daily vitamin D supplementation at least 1000 IU as well as calcium to reduce the risk for fractures and falls.

### Dietary vitamin D intake for the elderly population: update on the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D [^113DJKWN]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency can be diagnosed with measurements of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). Most vitamin D is derived from sunlight (80%), so serum 25OHD levels are lowest in late winter and early spring. Dietary vitamin D in North America is small, about 100 to 200 IU daily. A recent review of the literature shows many association studies relating vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency to several diseases. Large randomized trials of vitamin D are underway and soon there may be answers as to whether vitamin D is clinically effective and what level of serum 25OHD is necessary.

### Vitamins for chronic disease prevention in adults: scientific review [^112nTHwo]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although vitamin deficiency is encountered infrequently in developed countries, inadequate intake of several vitamins is associated with chronic disease.

Objective

To review the clinically important vitamins with regard to their biological effects, food sources, deficiency syndromes, potential for toxicity, and relationship to chronic disease.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles about vitamins in relation to chronic diseases and their references published from 1966 through January 11, 2002.

Data Extraction

We reviewed articles jointly for the most clinically important information, emphasizing randomized trials where available.

Data Synthesis

Our review of 9 vitamins showed that elderly people, vegans, alcohol-dependent individuals, and patients with malabsorption are at higher risk of inadequate intake or absorption of several vitamins. Excessive doses of vitamin A during early pregnancy and fat-soluble vitamins taken anytime may result in adverse outcomes. Inadequate folate status is associated with neural tube defect and some cancers. Folate and vitamins B(6) and B(12) are required for homocysteine metabolism and are associated with coronary heart disease risk. Vitamin E and lycopene may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. Vitamin D is associated with decreased occurrence of fractures when taken with calcium.

Conclusions

Some groups of patients are at higher risk for vitamin deficiency and suboptimal vitamin status. Many physicians may be unaware of common food sources of vitamins or unsure which vitamins they should recommend for their patients. Vitamin excess is possible with supplementation, particularly for fat-soluble vitamins. Inadequate intake of several vitamins has been linked to chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis

### Recommendations for improving women's bone health throughout the lifespan [^115qjVJ4]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Promoting early education and a bone healthy lifestyle

Clinical care for osteoporosis typically occurs late in adult life, as bone mineral density (BMD) naturally decreases and risk for fracture increases substantially with age. However, there is value in starting conversations and encouraging individuals to adopt proactive measures to build bone and reduce risk for fracture much earlier in life, especially while bones are still developing.

Adolescence is a critical period for bone mineral accrual, as 40%–60% of adult PBM is accrued during the adolescent years. It is estimated that a 10% increase in the PBM of children and adolescents can reduce the risk of an osteoporotic fracture during adulthood by 50%. In women, the rate of bone accrual peaks in early adolescence (11–14 years old), though bones slowly continue to build in the years immediately following, until PBM is achieved in young adulthood (25–35 years old). Preventive measures initiated during childhood and adolescence when bone mass is still being accrued can have lifelong benefits.

Diet and exercise are two established ways to increase, maintain, and support BMD throughout the lifespan, while also mitigating fall and fracture risk. Calcium plays a critical role in building and maintaining healthy bone, and vitamin D facilitates proper absorption of calcium. Although both are available as supplements, dietary intake is the preferred way to satisfy the daily consumption recommendations. Dairy products have a particularly high calcium content and are invaluable to a calcium-rich diet. However, it is difficult to achieve sufficient circulating levels of vitamin D from diet alone.

Thus, the National Academy of Medicine recommends, and clinical societies that engage bone health also endorse, vitamin D supplementation for all children, adolescents, and young adults. Since the release of this recommendation in 2010, investigations continue to elucidate associations between vitamin D and bone health outcomes.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1146dLP9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A decrease in BMD with age is well documented, with osteoporosis developing when negative bone balance exists, distinguishable by an imbalance in the coupling of bone formation and resorption by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Regardless of treatment allocation, BMD at all three sites declined by approximately 1% (ranging from −0.7% to −1.4%) over the 2‐year intervention. Our observations are comparable with rates of BMD decline observed in other studies. Through the use of an active placebo, with vitamin D administered to both treatment arms, all participants likely benefited from the current intervention given that vitamin D, combined with calcium, has a well‐documented role in bone health, with evidence that higher serum 25(OH)D is associated with greater BMD in older adults. Given that both groups received vitamin D, it can be assumed that any effect of B‐vitamin intervention on BMD decline was independent of vitamin D.

Clinical considerations — general management in adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis: Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating adults with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures, noting that there are many available risk assessment tools with varying predictive value, which were not evaluated in the systematic review or in this guideline.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^1111pKfZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, impairment of muscle function, and an increased risk of falls and fractures. The results of clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD), bone loss, falls, and fractures have yielded conflicting results, and, although a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials reported a possible relation between vitamin D supplementation and higher BMD at the neck of femur, it suggested that supplementation with vitamin D has a benefit for bone health only in those at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Internationally, guidelines differ in their recommendations for vitamin D status for musculoskeletal health, as reflected by circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations: in the United Kingdom, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommends a concentration of ≥ 25 nmol/L. In North America, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a concentration of 50 nmol/L, whereas the Endocrine Society clinical guideline recommends a target concentration of 75 nmol/L for the maintenance of bone health and other nonskeletal benefit. The UK dietary Reference Nutrient Intake is 10 μg [400 international units (IU)]/d, whereas in North America, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for those aged > 70 y is 20 μg (800 IU)/d. However, in this age group in the United Kingdom, the mean daily vitamin D intake from dietary sources (including nutritional supplements) is ∼5.2 μg (208 IU)/d, and medical prescription of vitamin D supplements is relatively uncommon, even among those at highest risk.

Calcium and vitamin D assessment and urine testing — It is advisable to assess adequacy of calcium intake and vitamin D through laboratory evaluation prior to initiation of pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis, and a 24-hour urine calcium collection is the best commercially available method of evaluating adequacy of calcium intake and absorption. Urinary creatinine excretion may be assessed in the same 24-hour urine collection as a gauge of the completeness of the collection, urinary sodium excretion may be measured as well if hypercalciuria is suspected, and high sodium intake may increase urine calcium.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^112o28dR]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"RCTs using vitamin D supplementation to prevent or improve possible nonskeletal diseases related to poor vitamin D status have generated mixed results".

There is also general consensus that severe vitamin D deficiency or absence of 1,25(OH)₂D (as in chronic renal failure) later in life can cause osteomalacia. Milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency generate secondary hyperparathyroidism in most but not all subjects of various ages and accelerates bone turnover and ultimately accelerates bone loss and the risk of fractures in the elderly.

In selected populations, RCTs with vitamin D and calcium supplementation demonstrated a decreased incidence of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures of ∼15%, with the effect being greater (i) in 80+ and 70 to 80 years of age persons than in persons 60 to 70 years of age, (ii) in those who are institutionalized in comparison with community living elderly, (iii) when vitamin D is combined with calcium supplementation, and (4) when compliance is > 80%. Nearly all major governmental guidelines confirm this policy and recommend that serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L should be avoided. Some expert groups (UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition), however, consider this conclusion still not sufficiently validated to recommend specific supplementation beyond what is needed to prevent rickets/osteomalacia. Other experts and grassroots organizations recommend much higher intake and aim for much higher serum 25OHD concentrations based on observational data and comparison with serum 25OHD levels in individuals living in circumstances similar to those of early humans.

### Vitamin D and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials [^113Dn1cK]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The lack of convincing associations and the relative dearth of probable associations (table 6) suggest that evidence for benefits that may be reaped from population-wide vitamin D supplementation is weak. Probable associations, where highly significant effects appear in randomised trials, hold the most promise for clinical translation, but they pertain to specific populations (children, pregnant women, patients with chronic kidney disease), and even in these cases the evidence is not sufficient to make universal recommendations about daily intake. Optimal vitamin D intake/concentration may not be the same for all outcomes. In addition, the absorption/metabolism of vitamin D differs among individuals; in practice, this means that the same supplementation dose is not going to have a stable effect on plasma vitamin D concentration, introducing yet another source of variability. Moreover, individual characteristics (such as body mass index or disease) will further modify final concentrations in circulation. In this regard, current recommendations on daily supplementation of vitamin D are largely expert driven, rather than evidence based, and this may be the reason why they have generated so much debate. Some recommendations that focus on specific outcomes such as prevention of falls and fractures and in which even higher doses of vitamin D are recommended (for example, the American Endocrine Society, Osteoporosis Canada) seem actually to be contradicted by the evidence, which shows no consistent beneficial effects in randomised trials. Our overview of the evidence on vitamin D suggests that strong recommendations cannot be made regarding its supplementation.

Conclusions, unanswered questions, and future research

In conclusion, although vitamin D has been extensively studied in relation to a range of outcomes and some indications exist that low plasma vitamin D concentrations might be linked to several diseases, firm universal conclusions about its benefits cannot be drawn. Observational studies have identified links with several diseases, but these have either not been evaluated or not been replicated in randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials for autoimmune and cancer related outcomes are clearly lacking. In addition, earlier evidence from randomised controlled trials that vitamin D supplementation (with or without calcium) increases bone mineral density and reduces the risk of fractures in older people is not seen in clinical trials that examine vitamin D only supplementation. On the basis of the results of this review, an association between vitamin D concentrations and birth weight, dental caries in children, maternal vitamin D concentrations at term, and parathyroid hormone concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis is probable, but further studies and better designed trials are needed to draw firmer conclusions.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116ZQLhe]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2006 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health was enlisted to review the 2006 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, which is especially prevalent among older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk for fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^1173WYpp]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The etiology of endemic rickets was discovered a century ago. Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient elderly subjects. VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects. These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties. From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D status can be optimized to improve many aspects of human health. Vitamin D deficiency enhances the risk of osteoporotic fractures and is associated with many diseases. We review what is established and what is plausible regarding the health effects of vitamin D.

### Factors associated with bone health status of Malaysian pre-adolescent children in the PREBONE-kids study [^115SuSd9]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepubertal age is an important period in life for rapid growth and bone accretion leading to peak bone mass attainment during adolescence and early adulthood. Accumulation of bone mass during this rapid growth phase is important for the prevention of osteoporosis at adulthood. A 10% increase in peak bone mass is estimated to halve the risk of an osteoporotic fracture in adult life.

Genetics may determine approximately 80% of bone mineral density (BMD) acquisition during childhood, however, modifiable factors including nutrition, physical activity and body composition are estimated to affect up to 20% of BMD. A National Osteoporosis position paper, which included a systematic review of all lifestyle factors influencing development of peak bone mass, concluded that evidence was sufficient to achieve an A grade (strongest evidence with consistent findings from multiple representative studies) for only calcium intake and physical activity. Calcium is the major constituent of bone mineral and increasing dietary calcium towards recommended intakes suppresses bone resorption. Physical activity and exercise exert a continuous stimulus on bone as a living tissue that responds to mechanical load, and therefore, is essential to maintain a normal bone mass. An adequate level of Vitamin D status received a B grade (moderate) level of evidence. Adequate vitamin D status facilitates calcium absorption by the vitamin D-dependant pathway, more dominant when calcium intake is low, necessary for normal calcification of the growth plate and the mineralisation of bones.

### Reducing fracture risk with calcium and vitamin D [^113BDzPM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50–75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits.

### Vitamin D effect on bone mineral density and fractures [^113FPZCC]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

One hundred years ago, vitamin D was identified as the cause and cure of osteomalacia. This role remains firmly established. Vitamin D influences skeletal mineralization principally through the regulation of intestinal calcium absorption. It has been proposed that vitamin D has direct beneficial effects on bone (besides the prevention of osteomalacia), but these have been difficult to establish in clinical trials. Meta-analyses of vitamin D trials show no effects on bone density or fracture risk when the baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D is > 40 nmol/L. A daily dose of 400 to 800 IU vitamin D 3 is usually adequate to correct such deficiency.

Osteoporosis in men — calcium intake recommendation and supporting evidence: We recommend that men with or at risk for osteoporosis consume 1000–1200 mg calcium daily, ideally from dietary sources, with calcium supplements added if dietary calcium is insufficient. Evidence notes no benefit for BMD from calcium/vitamin D supplementation in well-nourished men with mean dietary calcium intake > 1000 mg/d, but increases in BMD were seen in healthy older men given calcium and vitamin D supplements; calcium- and vitamin D-fortified milk increased BMD and improved femoral bone structure in older men. Observational data indicate dietary calcium was not related to fractures in men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, whereas low dietary calcium intake was associated with higher fracture risk in a cohort of Australian men.

### Effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on volumetric bone… [^11575Nfu]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01900860 Vitamin D supplementation has been considered beneficial for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Clinical trial data support skeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementation in persons with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of less than 30 nmol/L. 1, 2 However, recent meta-analyses do not support a major treatment benefit of vitamin D for osteoporosis3, 4 or preventing falls4 or fractures. 4, 5 Most vitamin D supplementation recommendations range from 400 to 2000 IU daily6, 7 with a tolerable upper intake level of 4000 IU to 10 000 IU6, 8. As observed with total volumetric BMD, cortical BMD results also demonstrated larger losses in bone density associated with higher dose of vitamin D at both sites. Trabecular volumetric BMD increased over trial duration with the 10 000-IU group gaining the least amount of bone density at the radius.

High-dose vitamin D without extra calcium supplementation has been associated with increased levels of the active vitamin D metabolite 1, 252 vitamin D, and an increase in CTx. 27 Calcitriol stimulates osteoclastogenesis and differentiation, either through action on osteoblasts28 or by direct action on osteoclast precursors. 29 High-dose vitamin D may also suppress PTH by direct action on parathyroid cells or indirectly by enhancing intestinal calcium absorption. This might reduce PTH-mediated bone formation, which when combined with a vitamin D–mediated direct effect on osteoclast activity, could result in the dose-related accelerated decline in observed volumetric BMD. The observation of an increased trabecular volumetric BMD while cortical volumetric BMD declined may reflect this increase in resorption, leading to trabecularization of the endocortical surface of the cortex.

Most of the prespecified safety outcomes occurred in all 3 vitamin D treatment groups. However, episodes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria were more common with increasing vitamin D dose, consistent with previous reports, 37 and the risk of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria is higher in individuals taking calcium supplementation, 38 suggesting that supplemental calcium intake may be a significant driver of hypercalcemia in individuals taking vitamin D.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### USPSTF evidence report: vitamin D and calcium for primary prevention of fractures… [^114M7Ssg]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Eleven RCTs in adults 50 years and older conducted over 2 to 7 years were included. Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin D decreased total fracture incidence but had no significant association with hip fracture. Supplementation using vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increased incidence of kidney stones, but supplementation with calcium alone was not associated with an increased risk. Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium was not associated with an increase in cancer incidence.

Conclusions and Relevance Vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium was not associated with reduced fracture incidence among community-dwelling adults without known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture. Vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increase in the incidence of kidney stones. Osteoporotic fractures occur as a result of bone fragility resulting from bone loss or structural changes. 1 Although not all osteoporotic fractures may be directly attributable to deficiencies in vitamin D or calcium, these nutrients are important modifiable factors associated with optimal bone health. 2 If effective, supplementation among unselected, community. Seven RCTs examined the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone, 14–18 calcium alone, 22 or vitamin D with calcium24, 25 on all-cause mortality. The evidence reviewed to inform an updated USPSTF recommendation is summarized in Table 2.

Among the community-dwelling populations without prior history of fractures or known vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis, the preponderance of the evidence suggests no decreased fracture risk from supplementation with vitamin D with or without calcium, although the strength of evidence was graded as low.

### Osteoporosis: the role of micronutrients [^116b7jSy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be a major public health threat. Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although the results are not always consistent. Higher doses than the current US recommendation (600 IU) of vitamin D in the elderly (age ≥ 65 y) may actually be required for optimal bone health (800–1000 IU/d). The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes; however, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is just being investigated. Vitamin D has been related to falls, with supplementation reducing the number of falls. There are clear fracture benefits demonstrated in randomized clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be easily met by a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate intakes for magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially important nutrients. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes (easily monitored by serum 25(OH)D) for optimal bone health, as well as the prevention of falls and fractures. In addition, a healthy diet that includes 5 servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

### Effects of supplemental vitamin D on bone health outcomes in women and men in the VITamin D and omegA-3 triaL (VITAL) [^111Qyvvh]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is a major health problem and primary prevention strategies are needed. Vitamin D supplements are widely recommended and prescribed in the general population to promote bone health. In the past decade, vitamin D supplement use has increased fourfold. Mechanisms by which vitamin D may support skeletal health include improved mineralization of bone through increased intestinal calcium absorption, prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and direct effects on osteoblast formation. Observational studies have indicated that high 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are positively associated with areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Data from large meta‐analyses and systematic reviews that support use of supplemental vitamin D alone (without calcium) to benefit bone are lacking. The few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D alone versus placebo have not shown significant changes in aBMD at the spine but showed small benefits at the femoral neck and/or a level of total 25(OH)D below which supplemental vitamin D increased spine and hip aBMD. Although RCTs provide the highest‐quality data, most previous RCTs of vitamin D versus placebo on aBMD were limited by design, including bolus dosing, short duration, small sample sizes, participants selected for vitamin D insufficiency, and/or inability to separate effects of supplemental vitamin D from calcium.

Bone strength depends on bone density and quality. Components of bone quality include cortical and trabecular structure, which can be assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Some but not other studies suggest an association of 25(OH)D levels with improved bone structure, though there are no large, long‐term RCTs of supplemental vitamin D versus placebo on bone structure. A recent study from Canada raised concerns that high doses (4000 IU/d or 10,000 IU/d) versus a low dose of vitamin D (400 IU/d) resulted in loss of volumetric bone density at the radius and tibia.

Recent estimates of vitamin D status among US middle‐age to older adults show that approximately 20% have 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L. Higher proportions of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency have been reported among black adults (reduced cutaneous vitamin D synthesis), obese individuals (vitamin D sequestration in fat tissue), and older adults.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^111SMwSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated a clear association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and total bone mineral density among the adult US population. We also revealed a significant U-shaped relationship, indicating that the serum 25(OH)D concentration associated with the highest bone mineral density was 81.1 nmol/L. The optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level for adult males is 84.8 nmol/L. For adult females, setting the threshold for vitamin D deficiency above 31.4 nmol/L is crucial, as lower 25(OH)D levels are not conducive to BMD. Moreover, they provide clinicians and researchers with a critical reference point for designing and implementing targeted interventions to optimise bone health outcomes in this population. Our study advances our understanding of the interplay between vitamin D status and bone health, paving the way for more effective strategies to combat osteoporosis and related conditions.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25 (OH) D less than 50 nmol / L… [^113cuYb2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blinded randomized clinical trial including 139 healthy term infants, whole-body bone mineral content, lumbar spine bone mineral content and density, and bone biomarkers were not different among dosage groups from age 1 to 12 months. Meaning This study supports a standard daily supplemental dose of 400 IU of vitamin D in breastfed infants in Montreal, even if born with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L. A dose-response relation exists between vitamin D intake and 25D concentration in infants, and the lower the initial concentration, the greater the rise in vitamin D status. 8, 9 Adherence to 400 IU per day of vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life prevents vitamin D deficiency rickets.

Our hypothesis was that infants born with serum 25D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L and provided with a supplement of 400 IU per day would have lower bone mineral accretion by 3 months without resolution at age 12 months. Infants at elevated risk of insufficient vitamin D status provided with a daily supplement of 400 IU did not have compromised bone outcomes across infancy. Similarly, Gallo et al11 and Rosendahl et al12 investigated BMC and BMD in predominantly vitamin D–sufficient infants and showed no differences according to dose of vitamin D supplementation ranging from 400 to 1600 IU per day. The consistent absence of a dose-response in bone mass suggests a saturable effect in bone mineral accretion when vitamin D is supplemented at 400 IU per day.

In conclusion, in infants with 25D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L at birth, both 400 and 1000 IU per day of vitamin D supplementation normalized and maintained 25D concentrations that align with skeletal health. The 1000 IU per day dosage of vitamin D supplementation did not lead to measurable improvements in bone health outcomes. Evidence from this Montreal-based study suggests that the standard of care of 400 IU per day is enough to support bone health of breastfed infants born with serum 25D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^1175pj7L]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The etiology of endemic rickets was discovered a century ago. Vitamin D is the precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)₂D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures. These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D–deficient elderly subjects. VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed. Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects. These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties. From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions. Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed. These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D status can be optimized to improve many aspects of human health. Vitamin D deficiency enhances the risk of osteoporotic fractures and is associated with many diseases. We review what is established and what is plausible regarding the health effects of vitamin D.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D screening and serum targets specify that all postmenopausal women with a confirmed diagnosis of osteoporosis should be screened with a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and the preference of the Writing Committee is that adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in women with osteoporosis should be at least 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) as noted by European guidelines, although Endocrine Society guideline recommends a threshold of 30 ng/mL (75nmol/L), either of which can often be met by ingesting 1000 IU of vitamin D per day; there is no consensus concerning a threshold level of vitamin D that should be reached when supplementing postmenopausal women.

### Dietary calcium intake and risk of fracture and osteoporosis: prospective longitudinal cohort study [^116ZqV7U]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporotic fractures are frequent in elderly populations, especially in women, and are associated with high healthcare costs and individual suffering. With ageing populations, the burden of osteoporotic fractures on society will increase in the coming yearsand the prevention of osteoporotic fractures is therefore a major public health issue. The importance and optimal level of calcium intake to compensate for skeletal calcium lossesand for the prevention of osteoporosis and fractures have been much debated and remain unclear. This is reflected by the wide range of daily calcium recommendations for individuals older than 50 years: at present 700 mg in the UK,800 mg in Scandinavia,1200 mg in the United States, and 1300 mg in Australia and New Zealand.

It is problematic to make recommendations regarding calcium intake based on the results from clinical trials and previous cohort studies. Meta-analyses of randomised trials found that supplemental calcium gave modestor no reductionin risk of fracture. Both the habitual dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D status may affect the outcome and are rarely accounted for in the design of calcium supplementation trials. Nor do observational data provide clear evidence, as emphasised by meta-analyses with differing results, on the association between calcium intake and fracture risk. To improve precision, prospective studies with repeated dietary surveys and large numbers of participants are needed.

Against this background, we aimed to investigate associations between long term dietary intake of calcium with risk of fracture of any type, with hip fractures, and with osteoporosis, in a large, population based prospective study of Swedish women.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

Figure 3.
Skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency. A deficient vitamin D status can cause impairments in the skeletal system such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and rickets, resulting in high risk for fragility fractures. Clear boxes with dashed outlines refer to the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency; dark boxes refer to the negative skeletal effects of vitamin D deficiency.

In a recent umbrella review of meta-analyses of vitamin D RCTs, the only consistent significant findings were for calcium and vitamin D, and not vitamin D alone, in reducing the risk of hip fractures by 16% to 39%, in 8 of 13 meta-analyses, and of any fracture, by 5% to 26%, in 8 of 14 meta-analyses. These findings were driven by events in institutionalized older and frailer individuals.

In children, the lack of calcium and phosphate causes the expansion of the epiphyseal growth plates due to decreased apoptosis of the hypertrophic chondrocytes, clinically visible as thickening near the joints and radiologically as widening of the growth plates. The weaker bone leads to typical deformities, such as knock knees (genua valga) and bowlegs (genua vara). The occurrence of rickets is mainly restricted to the Middle East and some countries in Asia, such as Mongolia and parts of China and India, while it is also observed in immigrants and refugees in other countries.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D – implications for clinicians [^113imBRF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify risk. We present our perspective, and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by ∼10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes that cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data becomes available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit health-care providers and patients alike.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency increases serum PTH, but most vitamin D–deficient subjects do not have PTH concentrations above the normal range. This results in progressive bone loss and, when severe, also mineralization defects. Epidemiologic studies show that vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower BMD and fractures. These consequences can be avoided by modest doses of vitamin D and calcium supplements. RCTs have shown that vitamin D decreases the incidence of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures by ∼15%, with the effect being greater in the 80+ years of age and 70 to 80 years of age persons than in persons aged 60 to 70 years, in the institutionalized group than in community living elderly, when combined with calcium and when compliance is > 80%. Vitamin D supplementation should be advised in all institutionalized and frail older persons. There is great unanimity that serum 25OHD concentrations < 30 nmol/L should be corrected. Serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L should be avoided. For subjects with limited exposure to sunlight this requires a daily vitamin D intake of ∼800 IU/d. This advice is generally in line with most governmental guidelines, except for the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition who recommended serum 25OHD concentrations > 30 nmol/L and a vitamin D intake of 400 IU/d for all subjects of whatever age at risk for vitamin D deficiency. This conclusion also does not contradict the conclusion of the United States Preventive Services Task Force dealing with a younger community dwelling population (mostly postmenopausal women) with a much better vitamin D status than the elderly or institutionalized subjects.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^114ziGoz]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is considered a public-health problem because it has a high worldwide prevalence and may contribute to a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Nutritional guidelines have established dietary intake references for vitamin D based on skeletal health because vitamin D is effective in the prevention and treatment of rickets and osteomalacia. To date, it is unclear whether vitamin D exerts additional musculoskeletal effects such as improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) or reductions in fractures and falls as some recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have questioned these previously proposed vitamin D effects. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that vitamin D may also play a significant role in a variety of extra-skeletal diseases including for example, infections, cancer, or autoimmune and neurological diseases. While there are many open questions surrounding the potential role of vitamin D for overall human health, it is becoming increasingly clear that vitamin D supplementation is not a panacea for all diseases, but it is effective in certain sensitive populations including those with vitamin D deficiency. In this context, various RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs have suggested that the beneficial effects of vitamin D are either restricted to, or particularly pronounced, in individuals with deficient (20–30 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 20 ng/ml) circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (calcidiol, calcifediol) concentrations. However, the biological active hormone is 1α,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D) (calcitriol), which acts directly through binding to specific vitamin D receptors and indirectly by regulating the parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium and phosphate metabolism.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^113ucDoM]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

A causal role of vitamin D for bone health is well established, as vitamin D deficiency is the cause of most cases of rickets and osteomalacia. Vitamin D also plays a major role in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy, and its deficiency can accelerate bone loss and osteoporosis of the elderly. Preclinical data suggest that severe vitamin D deficiency may have extraskeletal effects. Many observational studies also link a poor vitamin D status to a wide variety of extraskeletal diseases. However, cause and effect have not been confirmed, and therefore the optimal vitamin D intake or optimal levels of the major circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) to achieve clinically detectable nonskeletal effects are not known.

The origin, transport, metabolism, and action of vitamin D have many similarities with those of iodide/thyroid hormones. Therefore, we compare both endocrine systems in Table 1. Vitamin D is either of dietary origin or can be synthesized in the skin under the influence of UV-B light. The dietary intake of vitamin D (mostly D 3 and minimal amounts of D 2) is usually low. Similarly, iodide intake is variable and depends on geography and dietary habits. For both systems, a complex system allows first the storage of precursor molecules in tissues (Table 1), followed by secretion of a prohormone in the blood where it is bound to specific transport proteins. Thereafter, the hormone precursors (25OHD and T 4, respectively) can be activated into the hormone [1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) and T 3, respectively] or inactived into other metabolites [initially mainly 24R,25(OH) 2 D and reverse T 3, respectively, but followed later by many other metabolites]. The active hormones have a high affinity for their respective nuclear receptors [vitamin D receptor (VDR) and thyroid hormone receptor] but much lower affinity for their serum transport proteins, thereby favoring the selective nuclear uptake of the hormones whereas the precursor preferentially remains in the bloodstream. The essential aspects of vitamin D metabolism and action are presented in Fig. 1. 25OHD can enter the renal tubuli as free [not bound to the vitamin D–binding protein (DBP) or not bound to proteins in general] via the bloodstream or as a complex with DBP by uptake mediated by megalin/cubulin after filtration in the glomerulus. Most other cells only have access to free 25OHD except maybe for a few cells with low expression of megalin (placenta and parathyroid cells). Therefore, free 25OHD and the extrarenal expression of CYP2B1 define the local production of 1,25(OH)₂D outside the kidney. Only kidney-produced 1,25(OH) 2 D can be exported to the bloodstream. Free 1,25(OH) 2 D then can gain access to the target tissues, activate the VDR, and thereby regulate gene transcription. A very large number of genes (∼3% of the human genome) are under the direct or indirect control of the active hormones, suggesting a broad spectrum of activities (Table 1). 1,25(OH) 2 D may also activate nongenomic pathways either by binding to the VDR or another receptor located in lipid rafts in caveolae, thereby transiently regulating ion channel activity (especially chloride and calcium channels), kinases, and phosphatases. The biological consequences of VDR activation are well understood and described in greater detail in this review. The biological implications of nongenomic actions for tissue or whole-body physiology are poorly understood. We mention two examples. First, the in vivo administration of a bolus of 1,25(OH)₂D can rapidly and transiently increase intestinal calcium absorption in chicks. Second, the absence of FAM57B2, a membrane receptor for 24R,25(OH)₂D, results in a transient delay in fracture healing, similar to the same phenotype as found in cyp24a1 -deficient mice. We will survey the well-documented and potential benefits of vitamin D and the risks associated with vitamin D deficiency with the goal of identifying a vitamin D status that is effective and safe in protecting health globally. First, we summarize data related to metabolic bone diseases and thereafter summarize the present state of the art regarding the possible extraskeletal actions of the vitamin D endocrine system. Throughout this review, preclinical data are briefly summarized, whereas human data are discussed in somewhat greater detail. Observational studies are briefly summarized whereas we focus more on Mendelian randomization (MR) trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses. Indeed, apart from an ongoing discussion about the relative value of observational vs RCTs, most governmental authorities consider RCTs the most convincing way to demonstrate the role of vitamin D in health. There is increasing attention to the use of MR studies to evaluate the lifelong consequences of genetically predisposed lower or higher serum 25OHD concentrations and health outcomes.

### A review of the health consequences of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic [^114c9q6T]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis and myopathy are among the better known consequences of a low to very low vitamin D status. Over the past several years various predominantly epidemiological and prospective cohort studies have found associations between low vitamin D levels and various extraskeletal conditions. These findings may particularly become important over the next years since large proportions of the population have low vitamin D levels. Increasing incidence rates of obesity, adverse life-style factors and active avoidance of sunlight seem to decrease average population mean vitamin D levels further. This article gives a brief overview of known and also less well-established potential detrimental effects of a low vitamin D status.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women [^111z9NC4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, a disease of increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly common as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. Vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with a mean age of approximately 63 years. In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes of between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200–1300 mg of calcium daily, with increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and decreased nonvertebral fractures. The decreases in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. There are insufficient available data supporting a benefit from vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^1167np1J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis [^113qJMQH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to put into perspective the many health benefits of vitamin D and the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing the risk of many common and serious diseases, including some common cancers, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Numerous epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sunlight, which enhances the production of vitamin D(3) in the skin, is important in preventing many chronic diseases. Because very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, sunlight supplies most of our vitamin D requirement. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the metabolite that should be measured in the blood to determine vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in infants who are solely breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation and in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities. Vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. A new dietary source of vitamin D is orange juice fortified with vitamin D. Studies in both human and animal models add strength to the hypothesis that the unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency worldwide is a contributing factor of many chronic debilitating diseases. Greater awareness of the insidious consequences of vitamin D deficiency is needed. Annual measurement of serum 25(OH)D is a reasonable approach to monitoring for vitamin D deficiency. The recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are inadequate, and, in the absence of exposure to sunlight, a minimum of 1000 IU vitamin D/d is required to maintain a healthy concentration of 25(OH)D in the blood.

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115SXLZA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

New U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned 2 systematic evidence reviews and a meta-analysis on vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium to assess the effects of supplementation on bone health outcomes in community-dwelling adults, the association of vitamin D and calcium levels with bone health outcomes, and the adverse effects of supplementation.

Population

### Bone health [^1179PqC9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Much evidence indicates that both calcium and vitamin D are efficacious in protecting the skeleton, particularly when these 2 nutrients are used in combination. Each nutrient is necessary for the full expression of the effect of the other, and where their actions are independent, their effects on skeletal health are complementary. Nutrient status for both tends to be deficient in the adult population of the industrialized nations. Hence, supplementation or food fortification with both nutrients is appropriate and, given contemporary diets and sun exposure, probably necessary. Various meta-analyses, systematic evidence reviews, and controlled trials evaluating these 2 nutrients will be defective if they fail 1) to take into consideration the nearly universal need to augment the status of both nutrients in the populations studied rather than just one or the other, 2) to consider the threshold characteristics of both nutrients, and 3) to use the achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration as the independent variable for vitamin D effects (instead of oral vitamin D intake). Problems with adherence to a regimen of taking supplements daily make an appropriate fortification strategy the preferred option for improving the status of both nutrients.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and 25 (OH) D sufficiency in childhood reduce the risk of fractures and improve bone mineralization in childhood: follow-up of a randomized clinical trial [^113giyfy]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study suggests an overall 60% reduced risk of fractures in vitamin D sufficient children whose mothers received high-dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared with vitamin D insufficient children whose mothers received standard-dose. This effect may be limited to certain types of fractures and may not include fractures caused by underlying skeletal diseases. In addition, overall independent effects of vitamin D status in childhood and supplementation in pregnancy on bone mineralization outcomes were demonstrated. These findings suggest vitamin D as a crucial micronutrient in early life for preventing fractures and promoting bone mineralization, which further may contribute to a lower risk of developing osteoporosis in addition to fractures later in life.

### Therapy of osteoporosis with calcium and vitamin D [^113VKrhZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Inadequate intakes of vitamin D and calcium lead to reduced calcium absorption, higher bone remodeling rates, and increased bone loss. Vitamin D insufficiency has also been linked to reduced muscle function and increased risk of falling. The mechanisms for the performance and muscle effects are not well understood. Administering vitamin D to those with inadequate vitamin D status has been shown to lower fracture rates in some trials but not in others. The purpose of this presentation is (1) to examine how calcium and vitamin D work in concert, (2) to consider key evidence that increasing vitamin D intake will affect risk of falls and fractures, and (3) to estimate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level needed to achieve maximum fracture protection.

### Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis, and therapy [^111Yb22R]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas.

Participants

From March 27–29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research.

Evidence

MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks.

Conclusions

Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25–40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D intake and dosing patterns emphasize that many scientific organizations recommend intake of at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults aged 50 years and older, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) suggest 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day as the safe upper limit in the general population; a meta-analysis in postmenopausal women found fracture reduction at doses of 700 to 800 IU/day or more. In frail elderly adults, monthly bolus regimens including 24,000 IU of vitamin D3, 60,000 IU of vitamin D3, or 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol were associated with increased falls, supporting that caution should be used with bolus dosing, and single, larger annual bolus doses are also not recommended where 500,000 IU of vitamin D3 was given annually in women with risk factors for hip fracture (median age of 76 years and baseline median 25(OH)D level of 21 ng/mL). Mechanistically, a single vitamin D3 dose of 150,000 IU led to greater 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than daily dosing of 5,000 IU for 1 month.

### Vitamin D deficiency: a worldwide problem with health consequences [^112bmgjr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most humans. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and foods that are fortified with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's vitamin D requirement. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and will precipitate and exacerbate osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of common cancers, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and infectious diseases. A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of > 75 nmol/L, or 30 ng/mL, is required to maximize vitamin D's beneficial effects for health. In the absence of adequate sun exposure, at least 800–1000 IU vitamin D3/d may be needed to achieve this in children and adults. Vitamin D2 may be equally effective for maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D when given in physiologic concentrations.

Vitamin D use in nonpregnant adults aged < 50 years — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. Technical remark: This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily). Background notes that levels of 25(OH)D lower than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) were seen in 14% of Europeans and lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in 40%, and in the United States, 24% and 6% of adults have 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), respectively; numerous studies have found associations between low 25(OH)D levels, low BMD, and fractures, low 25(OH)D levels have also been associated with fatigue and higher risks for respiratory infections, and the age span of 18 to 50 years is when peak bone mass occurs.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1113vJVV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — calcium and vitamin D safety and dosing indicate that supplementation with vitamin D of up to 4000 IU/d is not associated with safety issues beyond hypercalciuria, but when combined with high amounts of supplemental calcium there is the potential for a greater risk of kidney stones; high-dose intermittent vitamin D (500,000 IU/y or 20,000 IU/wk) can lead to a greater risk of falls and fractures; the Institute of Medicine recommends 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day, and Writing Committee members prefer keeping calcium supplement intake < 1000 mg/d; most postmenopausal women in the United States now consume close to 1000 mg/day, an increase of > 200 mg/d from the late 1990s.

### Ibandronate sodium (Boniva) [^115yvWbs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake
is inadequate. Intake of supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be delayed
for at least 60 minutes following oral administration of BONIVA in order to
maximize absorption of BONIVA.

Physicians should be alert to signs or symptoms signaling a possible
esophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to
discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of
esophageal irritation such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing,
retrosternal pain, or heartburn.

17.2 FDA-Approved Patient Labeling

Read this patient information carefully before you start taking
BONIVA. Read this patient information each time you get a refill for BONIVA.
There may be new information. This information is not everything you need to
know about BONIVA. It does not take the place of talking with your health care
provider about your condition or your treatment. Talk about BONIVA with your
health care provider before you start taking it, and at your regular
check-ups.

What is the most important information I should
know about BONIVA?

BONIVA may cause serious problems in the stomach and the esophagus (the tube
that connects your mouth and stomach) such as trouble swallowing, heartburn, and
ulcers (see " What are the possible side
effects of BONIVA? ").

You must take BONIVA exactly as prescribed for BONIVA to
work for you and to lower the chance of serious side effects (see " How should I take BONIVA? ").

What is BONIVA?

BONIVA is a prescription medicine used to treat or prevent osteoporosis in
women after menopause (see the end of this leaflet for " What is osteoporosis? ").

BONIVA may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing
bone mass in most women who take it, even though they won't be able to see or
feel a difference. BONIVA may help lower the chances of breaking bones
(fractures).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Nutritional considerations in osteoporosis [^117N3Z4m]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Proper nutrition therapy plays a crucial role in both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D from dietary or supplement sources have historically been the major therapeutic focus of both practitioners who treat osteoporosis and patients who seek nutrition advice for osteoporosis. Current research continues to expand understanding of these nutrients while examining the roles of other nutrients in bone health. In some cases, research has examined specific foods or beverages and their effect on bone density, broadening understanding of eating patterns and bone health. This review focuses on recent nutrition-related findings that will help physicians, registered dietitians, nurses, and other health care professionals advise patients better on dietary changes to improve bone mineral density and potentially lower fracture risk.

### Vitamin D and health in the 21st century: bone and beyond. executive summary [^11437sGW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is unique, in terms of its metabolism and physiologic features and the human reliance on both endogenous production (activation through exposure to ultraviolet light) and exogenous sources (diet, primarily fortified foods) to meet biological requirements. Recent evidence has indicated a reemergence of vitamin D-deficient rickets and an alarming prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (ie, low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) in particular segments of the US population. Furthermore, evidence has emerged implicating vitamin D status in a range of adverse health conditions, including cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a conference organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements was held to explore current knowledge and to develop a research agenda to address the range of issues associated with vitamin D and health during the life cycle. These proceedings contain presentations about 1) existing data on vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, 2) the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of vitamin D, 3) the strength of evidence supporting reconsideration of current policies regarding vitamin D intake, 4) gaps in understanding of the factors affecting and current options for improving vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, and 5) research needs to address gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D assessment, biological features, and requirements. This executive summary provides an overview of the conference and its conclusions.

### Vitamin D supplementation and the incidence of fractures in the elderly healthy population: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115tad9R]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although a well-established component of bone metabolism, the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of fractures in elderly healthy individuals is still unclear.

Purpose

To perform a meta-analysis comparing vitamin D supplementation with placebo and its contributions on fracture incidence.

Methods

This meta-analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), under protocol CRD42023484979. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases from inception to November 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin D supplementation versus placebo in individuals with 60 years of age or more and without bone related medical conditions such as cancer and osteoporosis.

Results

Seven RCTs with 71,899 patients were included, of whom 36,822 (51.2%) were women. There was no significant difference in total fracture incidence (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.93–1.14; p = 0.56; I² = 58%) between groups or subgroups. However, women had an increased risk for hip fractures (164 vs. 121 events; RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.06–1.70; p = 0.01; I² = 0%). There was no significant difference in non-vertebral fractures, osteoporotic fractures development, or falls (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.94–1.12; p = 0.6; I² = 47%; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.87–1.08; p = 0.63; I² = 0%; RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.97–1.04; p = 0.66; I² = 55%, respectively).

Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the total fracture development rate in the elderly healthy population, and it may increase the incidence of hip fractures among elderly healthy women. This finding suggests refraining from prescribing high intermittent doses of vitamin D, without calcium, to individuals aged 60 or older with unknown vitamin D serum concentration or osteoporosis status and inadequate calcium intake.

### Calcium and vitamin D in osteoporosis [^113j9Tqk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are useful adjunctive therapies in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Peak BMD is optimally achieved with sustained optimal calcium and vitamin D intakes. Calcium and vitamin D intakes continue to be important after the third decade and into senescence. Although calcium and vitamin D are not therapies to be used alone to prevent early postmenopausal bone loss, they assume more prominent roles in late menopause and in the elderly to preserve bone health with advancing age. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an important adjunctive therapy to use together with antiresorptive therapies.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113oXPU9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This overview of successive meta-analyses regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fracture risk highlights the limitations of heterogeneous meta-analyses in terms of sample size, events, and low basal vitamin D levels, and sufficient change in serum vitamin D levels as confirmatory effects of clinical intervention, high adherence to interventions, and appropriate statistical approaches to the same clinical problem.

Recently a retrospective study performed by Zhuang et al.analyzed in postmenopausal women (aged 50–98 years) the effect of age, BMI, BMD, and 25(OH)D serum levels over hip fracture risk when the femoral neck reached the threshold of osteoporosis. According to logistic regression analysis age, low femoral neck BMD, and low serum 25(OH)D levels were independent risk factors for fragile hip fracture with the condition that femoral neck BMD had reached the threshold of osteoporosis. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be a positive intervention to reduce the risk of fragile femoral neck. The recent Consensus Statement on vitamin D concluded that "vitamin D supplementation with adequate calcium intake can decrease the incidence of fractures in elderly vitamin D deficient subjects". Despite this, there is a need for more specific evidence on the matter.

Another issue is determining the appropriate dosage of vitamin D supplementation and calcium in order to prevent fractures. Specific treatments for osteoporosis and fracture risk, with different mechanisms of action, have in general included vitamin D supplementation, mainly in older women. Overall, intervention has been recommended in women who are postmenopausal and have low BMD (T score < –2.5), a history of spine or hip fracture, or a score suggestive of increased fracture risk as assessed with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis include a many heterogeneous and varied options. However, it must be borne in mind that the aim of treating osteoporosis is to reduce facture risk. This means that pharmacological treatments should not be used in women with low BMD who have low fracture risk. The majority of postmenopausal women only require healthy lifestyle recommendations to reduce osteoporosis risk. Quality-of-life impairment will occur among elderly subjects in the event of a fracture. Specific drug treatments should be given in some women due to risk of fracture.

### Optimal vitamin D status: a critical analysis on the basis of evidence-based medicine [^114aveQL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation.

Methods

We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health.

Conclusions

The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The greatest risk for cancer, infections, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels below 20 ng/mL. There is ample evidence from RCTs that calcium and bone homeostasis, estimated from serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH, calcium absorption, or bone mass, can be normalized by 25OHD levels above 20 ng/mL. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500–700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL. Therefore, the recommendations for a daily intake of 1500–2000 IU/d or serum 25OHD levels of 30 ng or higher for all adults or elderly subjects, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Task Force, are premature. Fortunately, ongoing RCTs will help to guide us to solve this important public health question.

### Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women [^117H7nUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non-vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) -0.04 g/cm 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.03; I² = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm 2, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; I² = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low-certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (-0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0; moderate-certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral). The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.

The optimal level of vitamin D

In the last decade, there has been growing advocacy for achieving higher circulating levels of 25OHD than are necessary for maintenance of normocalcemia, in the hope that this has additional benefits for bone and non-bone health. In 2011, the governments of USA and Canada commissioned a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and concluded that:
the estimated average vitamin D requirement from all dietary sources should be 10 µg (400 IU) daily in those with minimal sunlight exposure;
a 25OHD level < 30 nmol/l indicated risk of deficiency and 25OHD > 50 nmol/l indicated sufficiency;
25OHD levels in excess of 125 nmol/l could be associated with harm.

The IOM considered that the recommended daily allowance for vitamin D should lead to serum 25OHD levels of at least 50 nmol/l and that individuals below that level should receive vitamin D supplementation. In contrast, the US Endocrine Society has recommended a higher treatment target (70 nmol/l) for health benefits and state that individuals < 50 nmol/l should be considered as vitamin D deficient. On the other hand, in fragile elderly subjects who are at an increased risk of falls and fracture, a minimal serum 25OHD level of 75 nmol/l is recommended by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO).

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.
