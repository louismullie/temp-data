## Question

does nasonex cause increased intraocular pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Nasonex (mometasone furoate nasal spray) can cause increased intraocular pressure and how to interpret that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and what the FDA says about ocular effects. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for systemic exposure and whether that plausibly affects IOP. Next, I will review randomized trials and observational studies specific to intranasal mometasone. After that, I should examine meta-analyses and systematic reviews to quantify risk. Finally, I will consider high-risk populations and synthesize practical recommendations for monitoring and counseling.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that frames baseline risk. The FDA labeling for Nasonex warns that nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in glaucoma and/or cataracts, advises close monitoring in patients with a history of increased IOP or glaucoma, and instructs patients not to spray into the eyes, which signals a recognized but uncommon ocular risk signal even with intranasal use [^113TQQA5] [^113qXUQs] [^115HTfBW].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic reasoning before jumping to conclusions. Mometasone furoate has very low systemic bioavailability from intranasal administration, typically cited around or below 1%, which limits systemic steroid exposure and theoretically reduces the likelihood of steroid-induced IOP elevation compared with higher-bioavailability agents; however, direct local effects via nasolacrimal drainage and individual susceptibility can still contribute to ocular steroid effects in some patients [^116Xuqhq] [^115YZctd].

> Next, I should review randomized and controlled data specific to mometasone. In the FDA-reviewed studies of Nasonex at 200 mcg/day, mean IOP did not change significantly over 12 weeks or 12 months, and no individual developed a clinically meaningful IOP rise or cataract attributable to treatment, which supports a low risk signal in typical users. Similarly, prospective studies comparing mometasone to fluticasone over 6 months found no statistically significant IOP changes, reinforcing class safety for modern intranasal steroids in healthy adults [^113qXUQs] [^1168PToU] [^1132rRXw] [^115VTTrg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from single studies; I need to check broader syntheses. A systematic review and meta-analysis of intranasal corticosteroids in allergic rhinitis found no significant increase in elevated IOP or posterior subcapsular cataract at 12 months, with an absolute increased incidence of elevated IOP of only 0.8% versus placebo, and zero cases of glaucoma in either group, which aligns with a very low clinical risk in the general population using INCS [^111K1dQ2].

> I will now examine mixed-route meta-analyses because some patients use both inhaled and intranasal steroids. Multiple meta-analyses report a small mean IOP increase on the order of roughly 0.7–1.2 mmHg among ICS/INS users compared with nonusers, with no significant increase in glaucoma incidence overall; importantly, this population-level signal is modest and may not translate into clinically important risk for most individuals, though it underscores biological plausibility and the need for vigilance in susceptible patients [^111hcyf9] [^113ndWqu] [^111RrNe3] [^117LzhG3].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a higher-risk group? I should double-check data in patients with existing glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Small prospective and retrospective studies suggest that some glaucoma patients may experience IOP changes with intranasal or inhaled steroids, and discontinuation of nasal steroids has been associated with IOP reductions in selected glaucoma patients; conversely, short-term trials in controlled glaucoma or ocular hypertension have not shown significant mean IOP increases with beclomethasone nasal spray, highlighting heterogeneity and the importance of individual susceptibility and steroid generation [^112PgdwZ] [^115BMV8L] [^111Kz81c].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility to ensure I'm not overlooking a pathway. Steroid-induced IOP elevation is well described with topical ocular or systemic steroids via effects on trabecular meshwork outflow, and while intranasal delivery minimizes systemic exposure, steroid-responsive individuals and those with preexisting outflow dysfunction may still manifest IOP responses. This mechanistic background supports why labels advise caution and monitoring in at-risk patients even when average risk is low [^111Kz81c] [^113TQQA5] [^115HTfBW].

> I should confirm practical guidance. For patients with risk factors such as primary open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension, high myopia, diabetes, connective tissue disease, or a strong family history of glaucoma, it is reasonable to obtain baseline IOP and consider periodic eye examinations during prolonged intranasal steroid therapy. For patients without risk factors, routine ophthalmic screening is not universally mandated, but new visual symptoms warrant prompt evaluation and discussion with eye care professionals [^113TQQA5] [^115HTfBW] [^1157hFKr].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the totality of evidence. In typical healthy adults using standard-dose mometasone nasal spray, the risk of clinically meaningful IOP elevation is very low and often indistinguishable from placebo in trials, with meta-analytic data showing no excess glaucoma and only a small mean IOP difference at the population level. However, rare individual susceptibility exists, particularly in patients with glaucoma risk factors, so prudent counseling and selective monitoring are appropriate [^113qXUQs] [^111K1dQ2] [^111hcyf9] [^113ndWqu].

Nasonex (mometasone furoate) **can rarely cause increased intraocular pressure (IOP)** [^113qXUQs], especially with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing glaucoma or ocular hypertension [^113TQQA5]. The risk is low due to minimal systemic absorption [^115YZctd], but clinicians should monitor patients with risk factors and discontinue use if IOP rises or visual symptoms occur [^113TQQA5].

---

## Clinical evidence linking Nasonex to increased intraocular pressure

- **FDA warnings**: The FDA label warns that nasal and inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone, may cause glaucoma and/or cataracts [^113TQQA5]; close monitoring is advised in patients with a history of increased IOP, glaucoma, or cataracts [^113qXUQs].

- **Clinical studies**: A 12-week controlled study of 141 patients found no significant IOP change from baseline with Nasonex 200 mcg/day versus placebo; similarly, a 12-month uncontrolled study of 139 patients showed no significant IOP change or cataracts [^113qXUQs].

- **Meta-analyses**: Systematic reviews report a small but significant mean IOP increase (~0.69 mmHg) with inhaled/intranasal corticosteroids versus controls, though glaucoma incidence did not rise significantly [^111hcyf9] [^113ndWqu].

- **Case reports**: Rare cases of steroid-induced IOP elevation have been reported with intranasal corticosteroids, including mometasone, particularly with prolonged use or pre-existing glaucoma [^112PgdwZ].

---

## Mechanisms of intraocular pressure elevation

Steroid-induced IOP elevation is thought to result from **increased trabecular meshwork resistance** from glycosaminoglycan accumulation, altered extracellular matrix, and steroid receptor-mediated effects, which reduce aqueous outflow and raise IOP [^111Kz81c].

---

## Risk factors for intraocular pressure elevation with Nasonex

- **Pre-existing glaucoma or ocular hypertension**: Patients with these conditions are at higher risk of steroid-induced IOP elevation [^1157hFKr].

- **Prolonged use**: Long-term corticosteroid exposure increases the risk of IOP elevation and glaucoma [^113ndWqu].

- **High-dose or frequent administration**: Higher doses or more frequent use may increase systemic absorption and IOP risk [^111dniuJ].

- **Individual susceptibility**: Genetic factors or steroid responsiveness may predispose to IOP elevation [^117LzhG3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Patients with risk factors should have baseline and periodic IOP checks during Nasonex therapy [^notfound].

- **Patient counseling**: Inform patients about ocular symptoms (blurred vision, eye pain, visual disturbances) and advise prompt reporting [^notfound].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop Nasonex if IOP rises significantly or visual symptoms develop [^notfound].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-steroidal options (e.g. antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists) in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management of intraocular pressure elevation associated with Nasonex

- **Immediate cessation**: Discontinue Nasonex if IOP elevation is confirmed [^112PgdwZ].

- **Ophthalmologic evaluation**: Refer for comprehensive eye examination and IOP monitoring [^115HTfBW].

- **Medical management**: Use standard IOP-lowering therapy (beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) as indicated [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess IOP after stopping Nasonex and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed [^112PgdwZ].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings regarding iop elevation** |
|-|-|
| FDA label | - Potential for glaucoma/IOP elevation <br/> - Monitor at-risk patients [^113TQQA5] [^116Gyuvj] |
| Clinical trials | No significant IOP change in 12-week/12-month studies [^113qXUQs] |
| Meta-analyses | Small mean IOP increase (~0.69 mmHg); no significant glaucoma rise [^111hcyf9] [^113ndWqu] |
| Case reports | Rare IOP elevation with prolonged use or pre-existing glaucoma [^112PgdwZ] |

---

Nasonex **can rarely increase IOP**, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The risk is low but real; monitor at-risk patients and stop therapy if IOP rises or visual symptoms occur [^113ndWqu].

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^114eG4qd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical management — endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), balloon dilation, and steroid‑eluting stents is detailed with comparative data and outcomes. Severe surgical complications with endoscopic sinus surgery are reported as 0.1% to 0.5%. For balloon dilation, one RCT of 32 patients of frontal ostium dilation suggested a slight advantage versus classic FESS, but these findings did not achieve statistical significance. An Austrian prospective comparison of balloon sinuplasty alone versus a hybrid procedure observed failure rates of 65% for balloon‑only and 66% for hybrid procedures and terminated the study at 45 patients; patients in the balloon group also required larger numbers of antibiotic courses and office interventions during a 12 month follow‑up. In summary, balloon catheter technology has been shown as a safe method to dilate sinuses but no studies to date can conclude an advantage over FESS. Regarding steroid‑eluting implants, a meta‑analysis of 2 randomized placebo‑controlled multicenter trials of a mometasone‑eluting stent over 30 days showed a 51% decrease in postoperative lysis of adhesions (P = 0.0016), a 40% decrease in oral steroid needs (P = 0.0023), and a 46% relative decrease in frank polyposis (P < .0001) compared with controls; a series (n = 143) included more than one fourth with previous sinus surgery and more than half with nasal polyps. Prospective studies after implantation of the stents have not found elevation in intraocular pressures, increase in cataract risk, or adrenal cortical suppression.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ndWqu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Starting in 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma recommended the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of reliever combination therapy in patients 12 years of age and older, thus dramatically increasing the population exposure to ICS. ICS and intranasal corticosteroids (INS) are commonly used for a variety of respiratory diseases. Chronic steroid use is a well-known risk factor for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma regardless of route of administration. This study aimed to determine the reported risk of glaucoma, ocular hypertension (OHT) and IOP elevation associated with ICS and INS use.

Materials and Methods

Systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and Web of Science databases from the date of inception identified studies that assess ocular outcomes related to glaucoma in ICS and INS users. Study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were done independently in duplicate. Meta-analysis assessed glaucoma incidence, OHT incidence and IOP changes in patients using ICS and INS. Study adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Study protocol was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020190241.

Results

Qualitative and quantitative analyses included 65 and 41 studies, respectively. Incidence of glaucoma was not significantly different in either ICS or INS users compared to control over 45,457 person-years of follow-up. Similarly, no significant difference in OHT incidence over 4431 person-years was detected. In studies reporting IOP, a significantly higher IOP was observed (0.69 mmHg) in 857 ICS or INS users compared to 615 controls. However, no significant increase in IOP was observed within ICS or INS users when compared to pre-treatment baseline.

Conclusion

Overall, use of ICS or INS does not significantly increase the incidence of glaucoma or OHT. However, ICS and INS patients had significantly higher IOPs compared to untreated patients. Awareness of these findings is significant in care of patients with additional risk factors for glaucoma.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114YBtd7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal steroids (INS) for AR — safety, growth effects, and use: The incidence of epistaxis with different preparations ranges from 4% to 8% over short treatment periods ranging from 2 to 12 weeks, with higher incidences (reaching 20%) over a year; biopsy specimens after 1 to 5 years of continuous INS showed no evidence of atrophy. Studies in adults and children evaluating effects of INS on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis show no adverse effects, but there is some evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression with betamethasone nasal spray specifically, and patients with HIV may absorb INS at a higher rate and need to use caution when using INS or find an alternative treatment. Although early reports linked INS with posterior subcapsular cataracts, later work failed to show development of posterior subcapsular cataracts, significant increases in intraocular pressure, or glaucoma. In pediatric studies, in placebo-controlled studies, fluticasone furoate, triamcinolone acetonide (in 2 doses), and fluticasone propionate for 2 weeks did not affect lower leg growth; in yearlong studies, intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate at twice the recommended daily dose resulted in growth suppression, but fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate showed no effects, and children followed for 2 years while receiving triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray had no significant difference between measured and predicted heights. Short courses of systemic corticosteroids have not been shown to be superior to INS, and while oral corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory effects, they are not recommended for the routine treatment of AR due to known significant systemic side effects and lack of superiority to INS. INS are strongly recommended for the treatment of AR; prophylactic treatment with INS is best initiated several days before the pollen season in subjects with known seasonal AR, and beginning treatment at the recommended dose is suggested followed by evaluation of the patient's response on follow-up, with the nose examined for signs of local irritation and the regimen modified according to the patient's response.

### Advance II: a prospective, randomized study assessing safety and efficacy of bioabsorbable steroid-releasing sinus implants [^111hhAfx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) may be compromised by postoperative inflammation, polyposis, and adhesions, often requiring subsequent intervention. To address this issue, the authors investigated the safety and effectiveness of controlled delivery of mometasone furoate to the sinus mucosa via bioabsorbable implants deployed at the time of ESS.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial using an intrapatient control design.

Setting

Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery centers; both academic and private practices.

Subjects and Methods

The study enrolled 105 patients with CRS undergoing bilateral ethmoidectomy to compare the effect of drug-releasing to non-drug-releasing implants using an intrapatient control design. Postoperative interventions, polyposis, and adhesions were assessed postoperatively. Efficacy was determined through independent analysis of randomized video-endoscopies by 3 blinded sinus surgeons. Safety assessments included ocular examinations.

Results

Implants were successfully deployed in all 210 ethmoid sinuses. Compared with control sinuses with non-drug-releasing implants, the drug-releasing implant provided a 29.0% relative reduction in postoperative interventions (P = 0.028) and a 52% (P = 0.005) decrease in lysis of adhesions. The relative reduction in frank polyposis was 44.9% (P = 0.002). Similar reductions were observed in real-time grading performed by the clinical investigators. No clinically significant changes from baseline in intraocular pressure or cataracts were observed.

Conclusion

This study provides a high level of evidence that use of steroid-releasing implants that apply a sustained release of corticosteroid improves surgical outcomes by reducing synechiae formation, polyposis, and the need for postoperative interventions, with no observable ocular safety risk.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate / formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^114oPF1H]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β₂-agonist is recommended for treatment of patients with persistent asthma inadequately controlled on ICS monotherapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) administered through metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with persistent asthma previously on medium- to high-dose ICS.

Methods

This was a 52-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, evaluator-blinded study. At baseline, 404 patients (aged ≥ 12 years) were stratified according to their previous ICS dose (medium or high), then randomized 2:1 to receive twice-daily treatment of MF/F (200/10 or 400/10 μg) or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S; 250/50 or 500/50 μg). The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of patients reporting any adverse event (AE). Additional safety evaluations included plasma cortisol 24-hour area under the curve (AUC(0–24 h)) and ocular changes. Pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, and use of rescue medication were monitored.

Results

The incidence of ≥ 1 treatment-emergent AE was similar across treatment groups (MF/F 200/10 μg, 77.3% [n = 109]; FP/S 250/50 μg, 82.4% [n = 56]; MF/F 400/10 μg, 79.2% [n = 103]; FP/S 500/50 μg, 76.9% [n = 50]). Rates of treatment-related AEs were also similar across treatment groups (MF/F 200/10 μg, 28.4%; FP/S 250/50 μg, 23.5%; MF/F 400/10 μg, 23.1%; FP/S 500/50 μg, 20.0%). Headache (3.7%) and dysphonia (2.7%) were the most common treatment-related AEs overall. The nature and frequency of AEs and the decreases in plasma cortisol AUC(0–24 h) observed with MF/F treatment were similar to those observed with FP/S treatment. Ocular events were rare (2–6% overall incidence among treatment groups); in particular, no posterior subcapsular cataracts were reported. Only three patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related ocular AEs (two for lens disorders in the MF/F 400/10 μg group; one for reduced visual acuity in the FP/S 250/50 μg group) and no asthma-related deaths occurred. Furthermore, MF/F showed numerical improvement in lung function and clinical benefits by reducing asthma symptoms and rescue medication use.

Conclusions

One-year treatment with the new combination therapies - twice-daily MF/F-MDI 200/10 and 400/10 μg - is safe and well tolerated in patients with persistent asthma.

### Discontinuing nasal steroids might lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma [^112PgdwZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Topical, intraocular, oral, and parenteral steroids might increase intraocular pressure (IOP), but little is known regarding the effect of nasal steroid spray.

Objective

We sought to examine the effect of discontinuing nasal steroid sprays on IOP in patients with glaucoma.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients with glaucoma using nasal steroids was performed. Averaged IOP for each pair of eyes was determined for presteroid use, steroid use, and 2 consecutive poststeroid use (poststeroid 1 and poststeroid 2) examinations.

Results

Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients taking nasal steroids were identified. The mean IOP for each pair of eyes was 15.4 ± 4.3 mm Hg (range, 9–23.5 mm Hg) for the presteroid use examination, 18.0 ± 3.8 mm Hg (range, 12–24.5 mm Hg) for the steroid use examination, 14.5 ± 3.3 mm Hg (range, 9.5–20 mm Hg) for poststeroid use examination 1, and 14.8 ± 3.4 mm Hg (range, 95–22.0 mm Hg) for poststeroid use examination 2. Eleven patients experienced decreased averaged IOP at poststeroid use examination 1 after steroid discontinuation at a mean of 35 ± 14 days and continued to maintain this decrease on the poststeroid use examination 2 visit at a mean of 191 ± 150 days. A significant increase between presteroid and steroid use examination IOPs (P = 0.007) and a significant decrease between steroid use and both poststeroid use 1 (P < .001) and poststeroid use 2 (P = 0.011) examination IOPs were observed. No significant difference between presteroid use and either poststeroid use examination IOPs (P = 1.00) was found. Many patients met their target pressures and were able to avoid or delay additional glaucoma therapy.

Conclusion

A significant reduction in IOP occurred with nasal steroid discontinuation in patients with glaucoma. Nasal steroids might contribute to IOP increase, and inquiry as to whether a patient has glaucoma before medication initiation is warranted.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HauKX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Change in IOP from Pre-Treatment Baseline

Collectively, 1360 patients had IOP measurements reported prior to initiating ICS/INS use, as well as at the end of follow-up. These data are summarized in Figure 3D. Overall, there was a 0.25 mmHg (95% CI: −0.85, 0.34, p = 0.41) nonsignificant increase in IOP following corticosteroid use. Subgroup analysis of RCTs showed a significant increase in mean IOP after ICS use of 1.09 mmHg (95% CI: 0.18, 1.99; p < 0.05). In NRSIs, IOP increased after ICS use by 0.04 mmHg (95% CI: −0.65, 0.74; p = 0.90). Within RCTs, IOP increased after INS use by 0.18 mmHg (95% CI:-0.20, 0.56; p = 0.36). In NRSIs, IOP after INS use was lower by 0.2 mmHg (95% CI: −0.55, 0.95; p = 0.60). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I 2 = 79%), and sensitivity analysis identified significant influence of large study by Chylack; however, overall conclusions remained the same with the study excluded. Similarly, separate analyses of adult and pediatric populations displayed similar trends.

### Safety of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis [^116Xuqhq]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for acute rhinosinusitis (RS) recommend the use of intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. However, the adverse event (AE) profiles of oral glucocorticoids, which result largely from the systemic absorption of those agents, have engendered concerns about the safety of INSs. These concerns persist for INSs despite significant or marked clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption and among the INSs in bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs. For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (eg, epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates that are similar to those with placebo. Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts, which suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.

### The relationship between long-term use of intranasal corticosteroid and intraocular pressure [^111Gxi1G]. Journal of Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between long-term intranasal steroid use and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation.

Patients and Methods

In total, 100 eyes from 50 patients on long-term intranasal steroids (> 2y) for allergic rhinitis and 90 eyes from 45 controls were included in this study. Patients on other forms of steroids and risk factors for glaucoma were excluded. IOP was measured and nonmydriatic stereoscopic optic disc photos were taken for each eye. The vertical cup-to-disc ratio and the status of the optic disc were evaluated.

Results

The mean IOP for intranasal steroids group was significantly higher (15.24 ± 2.31mmHg) compared to the control group (13.91 ± 1.86mmHg; P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences in the vertical cup-to-disc ratio and the status of glaucomatous optic disc changes between the groups.

Conclusions

Prolonged use of intranasal steroids cause statistical significant increase in IOP in patients with allergic rhinitis although no significant glaucomatous disc changes were seen. We suggest patients on long-term use of intranasal steroid have a yearly eye examination to be monitored for IOP elevation and those with additional risk factors for glaucoma is closely monitored for glaucoma.

### Ocular safety of fluticasone furoate nasal spray in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis: a 2-year study [^116zKoCN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate the ocular effects of an intranasal corticosteroid during 2 years of treatment for perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR).

Objective

To assess ocular safety in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with PAR after 2 years of continuous treatment with fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS), 110 μg once daily, and placebo.

Methods

This was a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of once-daily FFNS, 110 ìg, and placebo in 548 patients 12 years and older with PAR. The primary ocular safety end points were time to first occurrence of an event for the Lens Opacities Classification System, Version III (LOCS III), posterior subcapsular opacity (PSO) and time to first occurrence of an event for intraocular pressure (IOP).

Results

On the basis of survival analyses, the difference between the treatment groups for time to first occurrence of a LOCS III PSO and time to first occurrence of an IOP event was not statistically significant (P = 0.39 and P = 0.34, respectively). Changes from baseline in visual acuity, LOCS III PSO, cortical opacity, LOCS III nuclear opacity and nuclear color, IOP, and horizontal cup-to-disc similar between treatment groups. There were no ophthalmic-related adverse events of LOCS III PSO or IOP that led to early withdrawal. The most common drug-related adverse event was epistaxis (FFNS, 28%; placebo, 14%).

Conclusion

These data neither support nor negate current recommendations for regular ophthalmic monitoring in patients treated with intranasal corticosteroids.

### Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate [^1138VWBN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Glaucoma and Cataracts

Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment).

5.4 Immunosuppressionand Risk of Infections

Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections.

### The effect of long-term use of intranasal steroids on intraocular pressure [^115YZctd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Intranasal steroids are used to effectively treat perennial and seasonal AR, and they consist of two generations of steroids. First-generation intranasal steroids (budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, and triamcinolone acetonide) have more systemic bioavailability in comparison to second-generation intranasal steroids (mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and fluticasone furoate). While systemic bioavailability can increase up to 49% with older generation steroids, it is < 1% for fluticasone and mometasone furoate. Absorption from nasal and gastrointestinal mucosa are the ways that intranasal steroids can enter the blood stream. Direct pass occurs via nasal mucosa without first-pass metabolism, so this can excessively injure the end organs. On the other hand, steroids absorbed from the gastrointestinal system undergo degradation in the liver, so less active metabolites can reach the end organs. It has been reported that the amount of steroids absorbed from the nasal passages is minimal in comparison to the amount of steroids absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, inflammation is present in baseline rhinitis and this may cause a high absorption of steroids from nasal mucosa.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uvhnx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

To date, multiple studies of various methodology, including randomized control trials (RCTs), prospective, and retrospective, studies, have looked at corticosteroid exposure via inhalation or intranasal routes, assessing systemic adverse effects, including ocular outcomes. As a result, some studies suggest increased incidence of ocular hypertension or glaucoma, while others do not observe such an effect. However, systematic reviews on the topic tend to focus on ocular administration of corticosteroids, and there is a lack of recent syntheses appraising IOP elevation or glaucoma incidence in patients exposed to ICS/INS. The purpose of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze all available data on incidence of glaucoma, OHT and IOP elevation in ICS and INS users, as well as to summarize and quantify the effects ICS and INS have on IOP.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate / formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^114Z2h2x]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Assessments of Safety and Efficacy

The primary objectives for the study were the number and percentage of all randomized patients who reported adverse events (AEs). A severe AE was any AE that caused inability to perform usual activities or significantly affected clinical status and warranted intervention. A serious AE (SAE) was any AE that was life-threatening or resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or required hospitalization. The secondary objective was an assessment of impact on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function as assayed by plasma cortisol 24-hour area under the curve (AUC 0–24 h) measured at baseline, week 26, and week 52 at selected centers.

Additional safety evaluations were ophthalmologic tests (applanation tonometry and slit lamp examination with full dilatation) conducted at screening, week 26, and week 52 to assess the number and percentage of patients who had a change of at least 1 unit in lens opacities classification system (LOCS III) grade or intraocular pressure > 22 mmHg; physical examinations; clinical laboratory tests; and measurements of vital signs and ECG. Per protocol, a change of > 1 unit in LOCS III grade or intraocular pressure > 22 mmHg was considered an SAE, and patients were to be discontinued from the study.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate / formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^115eLLZx]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Objective: The combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β 2 -agonist is recommended for treatment of patients with persistent asthma inadequately controlled on ICS monotherapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) administered through metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with persistent asthma previously on medium- to high-dose ICS. Methods: This was a 52-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, evaluator-blinded study. At baseline, 404 patients (aged > 12 years) were stratified according to their previous ICS dose (medium or high), then randomized 2:1 to receive twice-daily treatment of MF/F (200/10 or 400/10 μg) or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S; 250/50 or 500/50 μg). The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of patients reporting any adverse event (AE). Additional safety evaluations included plasma cortisol 24-hour area under the curve (AUC 0–24h) and ocular changes. Pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, and use of rescue medication were monitored. Results: The incidence of > 1 treatment-emergent AE was similar across treatment groups (MF/F 200/10 μg, 77.3% [n = 109]; FP/S 250/50 μg, 82.4% [n = 56]; MF/F 400/10 μg, 79.2% [n = 103]; FP/S 500/50 μg, 76.9% [n = 50]). Rates of treatment-related AEs were also similar across treatment groups (MF/F 200/10 μg, 28.4%; FP/S 250/50 μg, 23.5%; MF/F 400/10 μg, 23.1%; FP/S 500/50 μg, 20.0%). Headache (3.7%) and dysphonia (2.7%) were the most common treatment-related AEs overall. The nature and frequency of AEs and the decreases in plasma cortisol AUC 0–24 h observed with MF/F treatment were similar to those observed with FP/S treatment. Ocular events were rare (2–6% overall incidence among treatment groups); in particular, no posterior subcapsular cataracts were reported. Only three patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related ocular AEs (two for lens disorders in the MF/F 400/10 μg group; one for reduced visual acuity in the FP/S 250/50 μg group) and no asthma-related deaths occurred. Furthermore, MF/F showed numerical improvement in lung function and clinical benefits by reducing asthma symptoms and rescue medication use. Conclusions: One-year treatment with the new combination therapies -twice-daily MF/F-MDI 200/10 and 400/10 μg — is safe and well tolerated in patients with persistent asthma.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hUVYy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma Incidence

There was no statistically significant risk difference in glaucoma incidence identified between corticosteroid users and non-users (Figure 3A). Subgroup analyses of both RCT and NRSI revealed no significant increase in glaucoma incidence for ICS or INS users. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal significant influence of large studies by Shefferor Changon subgroup or overall risk difference, or heterogeneity. No significant differences were identified between adult and pediatric populations.

OHT Incidence

Studies reported different thresholds for classification of OHT, beginning at IOP above 20 mmHg, 21 mmHg, or 22 mmHg. Many authors reported only occurrence of IOP elevation, without specifying the magnitude. Overall, there was no statistically significant risk difference in OHT incidence or incidence of IOP elevation between corticosteroid users and non-users (Figure 3B). Subgroup analysis accounting for different reporting styles was overall consistent with the summary analysis, revealing two subgroups slightly favoring control. Both of these subgroups included RCT studies that used > 22 mmHg as an IOP threshold for OHT, with one of these reporting a 27% increased risk with ICS use in a sample of 30 patients over 30 person-years, and the other reporting a 2% risk increase with INS use in a sample of 806 patients over 806 person years. In the latter subgroup, a 2% risk increase persisted despite a study that included 66 patients over 16 person years reporting 0% increased risk. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal significant influence of the large study by LaForceon the analysis. Pediatric and adult populations did not display significantly different trends.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Allergic Rhinitis

Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older

In controlled U.S. and international clinical studies, a total of 3,210 adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with allergic rhinitis received treatment with mometasone furoate nasal spray at doses of 50 mcg/day to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients (n = 2,103) were treated with 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older have been treated for one year or longer. Adverse reactions did not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. Four percent or less of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse events and the discontinuation rate was similar for the vehicle and active comparators.

All adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to treatment) reported by 5% or more of adult and pediatric patients ages 12 years and older who received mometasone furoate nasal spray, 200 mcg/day vs. placebo and that were more common with mometasone furoate nasal spray than placebo, are displayed in Table 1 below.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mometasone furoate INH (also known as Nasonex, Asmanex, Asmanex HFA, Elocon, Sinuva, Propel):
- **Corticosteroid withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period. Use caution when transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy.
- **Decreased bone mineral density**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term corticosteroid use has been associated with an increased risk of osteopoenia and osteoporosis.
- **Glaucoma, cataract**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts.
- **Growth delay**: use caution in pediatric patients.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome**: use caution in patients receiving high doses or susceptible patients receiving regular doses.
- **Immunosuppression**: use caution in patients with active or latent tuberculous, systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.
- **Increased serum mometasone levels**: use caution in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin.
- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Advise patients to rinse the mouth with water and spit out the contents without swallowing.
- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as paradoxical bronchospasm may occur after administration.

### Intranasal corticosteroid therapy: systematic review and meta-analysis of reported safety and adverse effects in adults [^115fjFVb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To address concerns related to the safety profile of both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and non-FDA-approved intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use in the adult population.

Data Source

Systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases using a comprehensive search strategy including all INCS formulations and adverse events. The study design was developed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Additional sources were identified from study references of relevant articles.

Review Methods

A structured literature search was conducted. Each study was graded for level of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Extracted data included population size, study design, drug (dosage, route, and frequency), presence of hypothalamus pituitary axis suppression, ocular symptoms, and treatment-related adverse events.

Results

A total of 60 studies met inclusion criteria. The studies included use of INCS as metered nasal sprays, drops, injections, aerosols, and irrigations. There were no persistent abnormalities in cortisol level or intraocular pressure change. Meta-analysis of epistaxis showed a significantly increased risk in the FDA-approved treatment group in comparison with control (risk ratio 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.14; p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Overall, it appears that the use of both FDA and published non-FDA application of INCS are safe in the adult population. Meta-analysis demonstrated an increased risk of epistaxis in patients using INCS compared with placebo. Otherwise, there was no significant difference between in adults in the treatment group and placebo group. As an important caveat, the interpretation of safety of nonstandard INCS is restricted to delivery methods and dosages published in the literature.

5.1	Local Nasal Effects

Epistaxis

In clinical studies, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients with allergic rhinitis with NASONEX Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Candida Infection

In clinical studies with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, use of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg should be discontinued and appropriate local or systemic therapy instituted, if needed.

Nasal Septum Perforation

Instances of nasal septum perforation have been reported following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. As with any long-term topical treatment of the nasal cavity, patients using NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa.

Impaired Wound Healing

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.

5.2	Glaucoma and Cataracts

Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated in one controlled study of 12 weeks' duration and one uncontrolled study of 12 months' duration in patients treated with NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg at 200 mcg/day, using intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examination. No significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 141 NASONEX-treated patients in the 12-week study, as compared with 141 placebo-treated patients. No individual NASONEX-treated patient was noted to have developed a significant elevation in intraocular pressure or cataracts in this 12-week study. Likewise, no significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 139 NASONEX-treated patients in the 12-month study and again, no cataracts were detected in these patients. Nonetheless, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts.

5.3	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions including instances of wheezing may occur after the intranasal administration of mometasone furoate monohydrate. Discontinue Nasonex Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)].

5.14	Glaucoma and Cataracts

Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the use of long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate, a component of DULERA. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use DULERA long term [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.15	Coexisting Conditions

DULERA, like other medications containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with aneurysm, pheochromocytoma, convulsive disorders, or thyrotoxicosis; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.

5.16	Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia

Beta2-agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical studies with DULERA at recommended doses.

### The effect of long-term use of intranasal steroids on intraocular pressure [^1157hFKr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Steroid-induced IOP elevation can occur in patients with risk factors, including primary open angle glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, high myopia, connective tissue disorders, and a first degree relative with primary open angle glaucoma.

Although patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma have a tendency for IOP increment when using nasal steroids, contradictory findings have also been reported in this patient group. Garbe et alinvestigated the effect of normal and high dosage inhaler steroid treatment on IOP in glaucomatous and ocular hypertensive patients, and they suggested that only high dose administration of these steroids for 3 or more months was associated with ocular hypertension and glaucoma.

In a small placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized trial, 19 patients, with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, used beclomethasone dipropionate nasal spray for 6 weeks, and the authors concluded that no statistically significant increment was observed in IOP when compared with the placebo group.

The only study that found detrimental effects of nasal steroids was by Bui et al, and they stated that discontinuing nasal steroids revealed a statistically significant reduction in IOP in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension (12 patients, eleven with glaucoma and one with ocular hypertension). While they concluded that nasal steroids might elevate IOP, the patients in their study used different types of nasal steroids (both first- and second-generation steroids), and measurements were not selectively performed for each type of steroid.

As a result of our study, we did not observe IOP increment with prolonged use of mometasone furoate and fluticasone furoate nasal sprays during 6-month follow-up. We think that there may not be a risk for increased IOP in healthy subjects.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate / formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^1145K7SS]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

This was the first study to measure effects of MF/F on potential ocular changes using LOCS III system. Overall, there were only five treatment-related ocular changes of mild to moderate intensity. More importantly, ocular changes associated with steroid treatment such as posterior subcapsular cataract and glaucoma were absent. This outcome is similar to the results reported in other 52-week studies in which only minor effects were seen in mean changes in LOCS III scores or intraocular pressure using other ICS treatment for asthma: ciclesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate in adult patients and FP in pediatric patients.

Although this study was not designed to evaluate clinical benefits of MF/F, lung function tests and other asthma-related clinical outcomes were measured to ensure that MF/F treatment had no adverse impact on patients' health. Study results showed that following the switch from prestudy treatment (medium- or high-dose ICS administered with or without LABA) to MF/F study treatment, patients experienced rapid improvements in respiratory function and asthma symptoms that were sustained throughout the 52-week MF/F treatment period. Furthermore, clinically judged deteriorations occurred infrequently in MF/F treatment groups and with similar frequency as in the comparative FP/S groups (i.e. within medium- and high-dose strata). Importantly, no case of clinically judged deterioration was considered life-threatening in this study. These clinical outcomes are consistent with the positive efficacy outcomes reported for long-term (52 weeks) FP/S and budesonide/formoterol studies of patients with persistent asthma, although it is important to note that differences between these studies and our current study (e.g. dry powder inhalers vs. MDI devices, patient age range, dosing regimen) make it difficult to make direct comparisons.

5.2 Eye Disorders

Use of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with ocular assessments that included intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 245 adolescent and adult patients (12 years of age and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis who were treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol 320 mcg daily (N = 197) or placebo (N = 48) for up to 52 weeks. In 94% of patients, intraocular pressure (IOP) remained within the normal range (< 21 mmHg) during the treatment portion of the trial. There were 10 patients (5%) treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol and 1 patient (2%) treated with placebo that had intraocular pressure that increased above normal levels (≥ 21 mmHg) and greater than baseline during the treatment portion of the trial. Two of these occurrences in patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol were reported as adverse reactions, one serious. No instances of cataract formation or other clinically significant ocular incidents were reported in this 52-week safety trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and rash have been reported following administration of beclomethasone dipropionate nasally administered and inhalationally administered products. Angioedema, urticaria, and rash have been reported following administration of QNASL Nasal Aerosol. Discontinue QNASL Nasal Aerosol if any such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)].

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112u8bXc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The new GINA treatment guidelines recommend increased exposure to ICS, notably daily use starting in patients as young as 12 years of age. Given the known effect of corticosteroids on IOP elevation and risk of glaucoma, widespread use of ICS and INS may raise concerns regarding OHT and glaucoma risks as even low absolute risks when applied to hundreds of millions of patients can be of significant impact. Even a 0.1 mmHg increase in IOP over a population can increase the risk of glaucoma or its progression.

Our search identified 65 primary studies discussing ocular outcomes in patients using ICS and INS, compared to control. Qualitative assessment revealed that most studies report ICS and INS as well tolerated, and do not raise ocular safety concerns. Quantitative assessment of 41 primary studies including 54,080 patients assessed difference in glaucoma incidence, OHT incidence, IOP between users and non-users, as well IOP changes following ICS or INS use.

Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in glaucoma incidence in ICS and INS users compared to controls in overall and subgroup analyses over 45,457 person-yearsof follow-up.

With respect to OHT incidence, there was a lack of consistency in IOP threshold between studies, ranging between 20 and 22 mmHg. Regardless of these differences, tests for overall effect and most subgroup analyses did not identify significant trends in risks for OHT incidence in corticosteroid users compared to control over 4431 person-years of follow-up. While single subgroup analysis of OHT incidence using a 22 mmHg IOP threshold demonstrated significant risk differences between ICS users and non-users, this subgroup includes only a single study with 30 person-years of follow-up, thus this finding is potentially of limited clinical significance.

### Effect of beclomethasone nasal spray on intraocular pressure in ocular hypertension or controlled glaucoma [^115BMV8L]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of 6 weeks administration of beclomethasone nasal spray on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension or controlled primary open-angle glaucoma.

Patients and Methods

Randomized double-masked controlled trial. Patients were randomized to twice daily beclomethasone versus placebo saline nasal spray. There were a total of 4 study visits: baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6 after starting the spray. Each study visit was at the same time within a 1-hour time window. Primary outcome measure was IOP. Secondary measures included visual acuity, anterior segment changes, patient reported side effects, and compliance. Study endpoint was 6 weeks from the start of treatment or an IOP increase of > 20% from baseline. A sample size calculation suggested that 8 patients in each arm would be sufficient to detect a difference of 3.2 mm Hg with a power of 80%.

Results

Nineteen consecutive consenting patients completed the study-9 in the steroid arm and 10 in the placebo arm. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in baseline characteristics, IOP at each study visit, or change in IOP from baseline at any time point. At 6 weeks, the change in mean IOP from baseline was +0.50 ± 1.52 versus +0.70 ± 1.44 mm Hg in the steroid and saline nasal spray groups, respectively (P = 0.77).

Conclusions

Patients with ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma showed no evidence of IOP elevation after 6 weeks use of beclomethasone nasal spray.

5.10	Effect on Growth

Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ASMANEX HFA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving ASMANEX HFA routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ASMANEX HFA, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.11	Glaucoma and Cataracts

Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the use of long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use ASMANEX HFA long term [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mometasone furoate TOP (also known as Nasonex, Asmanex, Asmanex HFA, Elocon, Sinuva, Propel):
- **Allergic contact dermatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone may cause allergic contact dermatitis.
- **Corticosteroid withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Exacerbation of skin infections**: use caution in patients with concomitant skin infections. Prescribe appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agents.
- **Glaucoma, cataract**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts. Avoid contact of mometasone cream with eyes.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome**: use caution in patients applying mometasone to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion.

5.9 Glaucoma and Cataracts

In clinical trials, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in 8 of 3007 patients following the administration of ASMANEX TWISTHALER. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use ASMANEX TWISTHALER long term.

5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ASMANEX TWISTHALER, it should be treated immediately with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator.

Treatment with ASMANEX TWISTHALER should be discontinued and alternative therapy instituted.

5.11 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX TWISTHALER with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YjJQT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) introduced what is described as the most radical change to the asthma treatment paradigm of the last 30 years. Previously, for patients with mild intermittent asthma, short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) alone were used as first-line therapy. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was reserved for more severely symptomatic cases. The new report from GINA recommended using SABA + ICS combination for both maintenance and relief therapy in patients of 12 years of age or older, affecting the patients with mild intermittent asthma who are not currently adherent to regular ICS treatment, thus increasing the population's exposure to corticosteroids. These recommendations influence clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines throughout the world and these changes continue to be reflected in the 2020 and 2021 GINA reports.

Asthma affects over 272 million people worldwide based on a 2017 report by Global Burden of Disease Study, which includes 3.8 million or 10.2% of Canadians. The new treatment paradigm exposes an entire new cohort of the patient population to ICS. In addition, many asthma patients are concurrently affected by rhinitis, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Management of these conditions often warrants intranasal corticosteroid (INS) use, increasing patient exposure to corticosteroids even further. ICS are also extensively used for medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another disease with significant health burden affecting over 251 million people worldwide, including 2.0 million Canadians.

Corticosteroid use has been previously linked to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). When IOP rises beyond a certain threshold, typically defined as 21 mmHg, the condition is defined as ocular hypertension (OHT). Glaucoma is a disease defined by progressive damage of the optic nerve, and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.OHT and glaucoma are closely related, and are often identified concurrently, as studies have shown that OHT is a major risk factor for development and progression of glaucoma. Anatomic proximity of the administration routes of ICS and INS, in addition to documented systemic effects, may increase exposure of ocular structures to corticosteroids.

Study Population

Patients included in the study were 12 years or older, diagnosed with persistent asthma of > 12 months, had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) > 50% predicted values, received medium- or high-dose ICS with or without LAB A for > 12 weeks before screening, and were on a stable regimen for ≥ 2 weeks before screening. Additional inclusion criteria were evidence of 2-reversibility (increase in FEV 1 of > 12% and > 200 mL within 10–15 minutes of SABA use); normal electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, and chest radiograph; and adequate contraceptive precautions for women of childbearing age.

Patients were excluded if they demonstrated a change > 20% in FEV 1; required use of > 12 inhalations of SABA or two nebulized treatments with 2.5 mg salbutamol on 2 consecutive days at any time between the screening and baseline visits; experienced a clinically judged deterioration (deterioration resulting in emergency treatment, hospitalization, or treatment with additional asthma medication other than SABA); had intraocular pressure > 22 mmHg in either eye, glaucoma, or evidence of cataract(s) at screening; was a current smoker (had smoked within the previous year) or ex-smoker (> 10 pack-years); received emergency treatment for airway obstruction in the past 3 months; or suffered a respiratory infection within 2 weeks before screening.

A full medical history, including asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and perennial allergic rhinitis, was obtained at baseline. Patients with a history of clinically significant medical illness or a disorder, that, in the judgment of the investigator, could interfere with the study or require treatment that might interfere with the study were not enrolled. Patients with conditions that were well controlled and stable (e.g. hypertension not requiring β -blockers) were allowed to participate if deemed appropriate per the investigator's judgment.

Statistical Analysis

Adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests including 8 AM plasma cortisol and 12-hour urinary cortisol concentrations, and physical examination findings including oropharyngeal and ophthalmic exam results were summarized by treatment group. For vital signs and laboratory tests, endpoint was defined as the measurement taken closest to the last day of study treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first asthma worsening were calculated using the treatment day of the first observation of an asthma worsening event and compared between treatment groups using a log-rank test. Patients who met the criteria for asthma worsening which required discontinuation were classified as having been discontinued for the purposes of this analysis, regardless of whether or not an investigator actually discontinued the patient.

Results

One-hundred patients (50 subjects in each group) were included in this prospective study. The mean age in the fluticasone furoate and the mometasone furoate groups was 47.48 ± 19.16 and 48.28 ± 18.83, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age averages and sex distribution were found between the groups (P > 0.05) (Table 1).

Averages for the IOP for the right and left eyes for the initial, 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th weeks of treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3 for both steroid groups. Although some IOP fluctuations were observed, no statistically significant differences were found on the paired comparisons of the initial and the four time measurements (P > 0.05).

PRECAUTIONS SECTION

General

Intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity reactions or contact dermatitis may occur after the administration of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP. Rare instances of wheezing, nasal septum perforation, cataracts, glaucoma, and increased intraocular pressure have been reported following the intranasal application of corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate.

Use of excessive doses of corticosteroids may lead to signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of HPA function.

Although systemic effects have been minimal with recommended doses of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP potential risk increases with larger doses. Therefore, larger than recommended doses of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP should be avoided.

When used at higher than recommended doses or in rare individuals at recommended doses, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP should be discontinued slowly consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy.

In clinical studies with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred only rarely. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP. Patients using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction, bronchial hyperrespon-siveness, and inflammation, with episodes of asthma worsening occurring in response to various stimuli. With their anti-inflammatory properties, inhaled cortico-steroids (ICSs) are the first-line therapy to relieve persistent asthma symptoms of all severities. For treatment of patients with moderate to severe asthma who are not adequately controlled on ICS monotherapy or whose disease severity warrants treatment with an additional controller medication, combination therapy with an ICS and a bronchodilator (e.g. long-acting β2-agonist [LABA]) is recommended by asthma guidelines.

Mometasone furoate (MF), a potent and safe ICS with high affinity for glucocorticoid receptors, is approved in the United States for treatment of asthma in adult and pediatric patients. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MF with regard to lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life as well as its safety and tolerability at multiple strengths (100–800 μg) and dosing regimens. Formoterol (F), a LABA, when administered as monotherapy, rapidly dilates airway smooth muscle and maintains control over 24 hours, thereby improving lung function and reducing asthma symptoms.

Because individual components of MF/F possess well-defined efficacy as well as pharmacologic and safety profiles when administered separately at recommended doses, the new MF/F combination administered through a single metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is expected to exhibit the same characteristics. A 52-week study was undertaken to determine the long-term safety, including cortisol suppression and ocular changes, of MF/F in patients with persistent asthma previously on maintenance therapy of medium- to high-dose ICS alone or in combination with a LABA. In addition, the study monitored pulmonary function, asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and asthma exacerbations to ensure appropriate disease management. Fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol (FP/S) MDI, a frequently prescribed ICS/LABA combination, was selected as the active comparator.

Materials and methods

One-hundred patients (41 women, 59 men; mean age ± standard deviation: 47.88 ± 18.90) were enrolled in this study. All patients were diagnosed with AR as defined by the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) study, and all of the patients were treated with intranasal steroid sprays. Half of the patients (50 subjects) used mometasone furoate nasal spray (Nasonex, MSD, Merck & Co. Inc. Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA; 200 μg/day) and the other half (50 subjects) used fluticasone furoate nasal spray (Avamys, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK; 110 μg/day). Each patient underwent a thorough otolaryngological and ophthalmological examination before treatment. Fundoscopic examinations were performed on all 100 subjects, and IOPs were measured using Goldmann Applanation Tonometry. All eye measurements were carried out by the same ophthalmologist, all the measurements were performed at the same time between 1 pm and 2 pm, and IOP was measured at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th weeks of treatment for each patient. This study conforms to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and it was approved by the Ethics Committee of Adıyaman University, and written informed patient consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria for study participation were additional nasal illnesses, such as polyposis or chronic sinusitis, ophthalmic or systemic disorders, previous steroid use (topical/systemic), known ocular hypertension or glaucoma patients, and under the age of 18.

Data analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Age distribution was not normal, and Mann–Whitney U -test was used for comparison of both groups. IOP measurements' data distribution was normal, Student's t -test was used for paired comparisons between preoperative measurement and other time intervals. A P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

5.1 Local Nasal Effects

Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration

In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Candida Infection

Evidence of localized infections of the nose with Candida albicans was seen on nasal exams in 7 of 2,745 patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray during clinical trials and was reported as an adverse event in 3 patients. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using VERAMYST Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.

Nasal Septal Perforation

Instances of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal septal perforation observed in clinical studies with VERAMYST Nasal Spray.

Impaired Wound Healing

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use VERAMYST Nasal Spray until healing has occurred.

5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 1 controlled 12-month study in 806 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older and in 1 controlled 12-week study in 558 children aged 2 to 11 years. The patients had perennial allergic rhinitis and were treated with either VERAMYST Nasal Spray (110 mcg once daily in adult and adolescent patients and 55 or 110 mcg once daily in pediatric patients) or placebo. Intraocular pressure remained within the normal range (< 21 mmHg) in ≥ 98% of the patients in any treatment group in both studies. However, in the 12-month study in adolescents and adults, 12 patients, all treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily, had intraocular pressure measurements that increased above normal levels (≥ 21 mmHg). In the same study, 7 patients (6 treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily and 1 patient treated with placebo) had cataracts identified during the study that were not present at baseline.

Materials and Methods

Literature Search Strategy

Details of the protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis were registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020190241) and can be accessed at. A predefined search strategy was used to obtain relevant literature from the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and Web of Science. Databases were first searched on May 23, 2020 using key terms and subject headings related to 1) corticosteroids 2) inhalational and intranasal administration routes and 3) glaucoma and relevant clinical findings such as IOP or OHT. Additional records were identified through screening of relevant studies' citation lists. References were managed in Mendeley (Mendeley Ltd, Version 1.19.8, London, England) and Zotero software (Version 5.0.96.2, Virginia, US), deduplicated and entered into Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Database searches were rerun on August 31, 2021, to retrieve any further studies for inclusion before final analyses. This work adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA;).

Study Selection

References imported into Covidence software first underwent level 1 screening based on title and abstract using pre-defined criteria. Studies advanced to level 2 screening if they 1) involved human patients; 2) were published in the English language; 3) involved administration of pre-defined corticosteroid drugs through inhalational or intranasal route; 4) measured an ocular outcome. Case reports, reviews, editorials, posters, abstracts, non-English language studies, and studies involving corticosteroids use through any other route than inhalation or intranasal were excluded. Full-texts were obtained. In level 2 screening, studies were selected for inclusion if they 1) reported IOP or any other clinical diagnostic features indicating glaucoma diagnosis or progression; 2) involved administration of corticosteroids through inhalational or intranasal routes; 3) possessed a sample size of at least 10 participants. All studies were screened by at least two independent reviewers and conflicts were resolved through consensus, and all studies passing level 2 screening were included in qualitative review.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112aK1F6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma diagnosis and management depend upon an accurate development of a risk factor profile for each patient. The results of this study do support the need for awareness among both practitioners and patients of the potential risk of long-term use of ICS and INS. Upon prescription, it may be prudent to recommend that patients actively seek regular examinations with an eye care professional and report the use of these medications.

Limitations of the current study are consistent with those previously identified by other authors working on the subject. Lack of inclusion of patients with family history of glaucoma is a potential confounder, leading to possible exclusion of potential steroid responders. Large variability in diagnostic methods, such as tonometry measurements, and reporting criteria for ocular outcomes, such as OHT threshold and glaucoma diagnosis, is also widespread. Similarly, there remains a relative lack of IOP data reporting in the field, making meta-analysis challenging and precluding dose-response analysis. Multiple studies, were found to have industry sponsorship – on one hand, this may raise concerns of a risk of bias; however, these partnerships fuel research that leads to discovery of vision-saving treatments and is thus an important source of research support. Results suggest future studies may be warranted that are more representative of the at-risk population, capture more detailed risk factors, include tighter definitions of endpoints, and incorporate comparisons of corticosteroid potencies, dosing regimens, and lengths of exposure.

Differences in IOP Between Corticosteroid Users and Controls

Among 857 ICS/INS users and 615 non-user controls (Figure 3C), corticosteroid users had significantly higher IOP with a mean difference of +0.69 mmHg (95% CI: 0.15, 1.23; p < 0.01) compared to controls. In a subgroup analysis of RCTs, ICS users were statistically indistinguishable from controls with a mean difference in IOP of –0.10 mmHg (95% CI: −2.89, 2.69; p = 0.94). In NRSIs, ICS users had a higher mean IOP compared to controls by 0.70 mmHg (95% CI: −0.21, 1.61; p = 0.13). In a subgroup analysis of RCTs, INS users had a higher mean IOP compared to controls (+0.06 mmHg; 95% CI: −0.85, 0.98; p = 0.89). In NRSIs, INS users had significantly higher mean IOP than controls by 1.21 mmHg (95% CI: 0.57, 1.85; p < 0.0002). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I 2 = 75%), however no large studies were identified to explain the large heterogeneity. Largest effect was noted by the study by Shroff, however overall result remained consistent even with this study excluded. Both adult and pediatric populations have displayed these statistically significant trends. However adult studies showed a higher mean IOP by 0.90 mmHg (95% CI: 0.08, 1.73, p < 0.02) in ICS/INS users compared to controls, while in pediatric population, this difference was smaller at 0.45 mmHg (95% CI: 0.33, 0.57, p < 0.00001).

### A randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid on intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension: the ICOUGH study [^115aaS5J]. Journal of Glaucoma (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of a steroid pressure response from inhaled corticosteroids.

Patients and Methods

This randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial included 22 adults with well-controlled open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Consenting participants were randomized to a 6-week course of twice-daily fluticasone propionate 250-μg metered-dose inhaler or saline placebo metered-dose inhaler. Biweekly clinic visits included masked Goldmann applanation tonometry and assessment to identify adverse effects. Primary outcome was mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at week 6. Secondary outcomes included IOP elevation of > 20% at 2 consecutive visits, adherence, side effects, and logMAR visual acuity.

Results

A total of 10 patients in each arm completed the study. There were no statistically significant differences in IOP between groups at baseline (14.3 ± 3.0 and 15.6 ± 3.6 mm Hg in steroid and placebo groups, respectively, P = 0.39) or at week 6 (14.7 ± 2.4 and 14.8 ± 3.8 mm Hg in steroid and placebo groups, respectively, P = 0.92). Adherence was > 80% for all participants. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any secondary measures. One patient in the steroid group met the secondary end point of > 20% elevation in IOP (IOP increased from baseline of 9 to 11 mm Hg at weeks 2 and 4).

Conclusions

We found no clinically significant increase in mean IOP in patients with well-controlled open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension after 6 weeks of twice-daily inhaled fluticasone propionate compared with inhaled placebo. No participants exceeded their individualized target IOP. There were no differences in secondary outcomes.

5.1 Local Nasal Adverse
Reactions

Epistaxis

Epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients with allergic rhinitis and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who received mometasone furoate nasal spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Candida Infection

Localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred from nasal administration of mometasone furoate. When such an infection develops, use of mometasone furoate nasal spray should be discontinued and appropriate local or systemic therapy instituted, if needed.

Nasal Septum Perforation

Instances of nasal septum perforation occurred in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate. As with any long-term topical treatment of the nasal cavity, patients using mometasone furoate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa.

Impaired Wound Healing

Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.

5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Glaucoma and cataracts may be reported with systemic and topical (including nasal, inhaled and ophthalmic) corticosteroid use. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use mometasone furoate long term [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions including instances of wheezing may occur after the nasal administration of mometasone furoate. Discontinue mometasone furoate nasal spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)].

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for maintenance asthma treatment include beclometasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, mometasone, and triamcinolone, and can be delivered by pMDI or DPI. ICS-containing medications are the most effective anti-inflammatory medications for asthma, and they reduce symptoms, increase lung function, reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of exacerbations, asthma-related hospitalizations and death; most of the benefit is seen at low doses. Adherence with ICS alone (i.e., not in combination with a bronchodilator) is usually very poor. Most patients do not experience side-effects; local side-effects include oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia, which can be reduced by use of a spacer with pMDIs and rinsing with water and spitting out after inhalation. Long-term high doses increase the risk of systemic side-effects such as osteoporosis, cataract and glaucoma, and concomitant cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin may increase the risk of ICS adverse effects such as adrenal suppression.

### The effect of long-term use of intranasal steroids on intraocular pressure [^1168PToU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term use of topical nasal steroids (especially older generation steroids) has been shown to elevate intraocular pressure (IOP), but newer intranasal steroids are thought to have a minimal effect on IOP because of their low bioavailability. This study aimed to investigate alterations in IOP with two commonly used intranasal steroids for a 6-month period of time. One-hundred allergic rhinitis patients, divided equally into two groups, used mometasone furoate and fluticasone furoate intranasal steroids for 6 months. IOPs were measured before treatment and repeated at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th weeks of treatment. The IOPs of the groups were then compared. No statistically significant alteration was observed between the groups during the treatment time period. It was found that new generation intranasal steroids can be used safely, and there may not be an increased risk of IOP elevation in prolonged use in normal healthy people.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mometasone furoate implant (also known as Nasonex, Asmanex, Asmanex HFA, Elocon, Sinuva, Propel):
- **Glaucoma, cataract**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression.
- **Immunosuppression**: use caution in patients with active or latent tuberculous, systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.
- **Nosebleed, nasal septum perforation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of local nasal effects.

### Intranasal corticosteroids Do not lead to ocular changes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111K1dQ2]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The safety and efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are well established, but there remains apprehension that INCS could lead to systemic side effects, as with oral steroids. The objective of this systematic review was to assess whether the use of INCS lead to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) above 20mm Hg, glaucoma, or formation of posterior subcapsular cataracts in adult patients with rhinitis.

Methods

Two medical librarians searched the published literature for records discussing the use of "nasal steroids" in "rhinitis" and their effect on "intraocular pressure", "cataracts", or "glaucoma".

Results

A total of 484 studies were identified, and 10 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of 2,226 patients revealed that the relative risk of elevated IOP in those who received INCS was 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68 to 7.34) compared to placebo. The absolute increased incidence of elevated IOP in patients using INCS compared to placebo was 0.8% (95% CI: 0% to 1.6%). There were zero cases of glaucoma in both placebo and INCS groups at 12 months. The absolute increased incidence of developing a posterior subcapsular cataract was 0.02% (95% CI: -0.3% to 0.4%).

Conclusions

Use of INCS is not associated with a significant risk of elevating IOP or developing a posterior subcapsular cataract in patients with allergic rhinitis. Presence of glaucoma, however, is the real clinical adverse event of concern. There were zero reported cases of glaucoma at 12 months. Future studies should formally evaluate for glaucoma rather than use IOP measures as a surrogate. Laryngoscope, 129:6–12, 2019.

### Safety of intranasal corticosteroids [^1121LwHj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Concurrent use of intranasal corticosteroids (INCSs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) is indicated for patients who are comorbid for asthma and allergic rhinitis. Clinicians need to know the data regarding INCS safety for their patients with asthma.

Objective

To discuss INCS safety data for the use of INCSs in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Methods

INCS safety studies were selected for their relevance to the discussion.

Results

To date, most studies regarding INCS safety are performed in patients with allergic rhinitis. These studies reveal no evidence of increased risk of nasal atrophy, and only isolated cases of septal perforation have been reported. Evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression is inconsistent and not clinically significant. Early growth studies indicated that beclomethasone dipropionate but not other INCSs have systemic effects on growth; however, newer, larger, and better designed studies are detecting small but significant growth effects in other INCSs. INCSs do not increase the risk of cataracts or glaucoma, although there are anecdotal data on transient elevated intraocular pressure. Data on concurrent use of INCSs and ICSs are limited, but these limited data reveal no evidence of systemic effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Conclusion

More studies of concurrent therapy are needed because concurrent use of ICSs and INCSs is common in practice. Clinicians might want to consider monitoring whether there are risk factors, such as a family history of glaucoma.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^115XUXVU]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect — medication adjustment and regimen planning emphasize that if a drug fails to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) sufficiently, switching to an alternative monotherapy or adding another medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained, and fixed combination therapy may improve patient adherence even though it is not recommended for initial treatment in most circumstances. The patient and the ophthalmologist together decide on a practical regimen considering dosing, cost, adherence, age, and preferences; the ophthalmologist should assess local ocular and systemic side effects and toxicity, including interactions and potential life-threatening adverse reactions, and patients can be educated about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion to reduce systemic absorption after instillation.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hcyf9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a small but significant IOP elevation of 0.69 mmHg was identified in patients using ICS and INS. Increases of this magnitude are known to increase the risk of glaucoma at a population level. The relatively recent GINA recommendations would cause a significant increase in the number of patients exposed to chronic daily corticosteroid use. Awareness of the potential risk of glaucoma may be an important consideration for patient-informed consent and recommendations for patient management.

### Topical medication instillation techniques for glaucoma [^112vEyz4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and the second most common cause of blindness after cataracts. The primary treatment for glaucoma aims to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) with the use of topical medicines. Topical medication instillation techniques, such as eyelid closure and nasolacrimal occlusion when instilling drops, have been proposed as potential methods to increase ocular absorption and decrease systemic absorption of the drops.

Objectives

To investigate the effectiveness of topical medication instillation techniques compared with usual care or another method of instillation of topical medication in the management of glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 December 2016), Embase Ovid (1947 to 8 December 2016), PubMed (1948 to 8 December 2016), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 8 December 2016), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts Database (1970 to 8 December 2016), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (last searched 13 May 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (searched 8 December 2016) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (searched 8 December 2016). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials which had compared any topical medication instillation technique with usual care or a different method of instillation of topical medication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened records from the searches for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We followed methods recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified two trials (122 eyes of 61 participants) that had evaluated a topical medication instillation technique. We also identified two ongoing trials. Both included trials used a within-person design and administered prostaglandin monotherapy for glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Because the trials evaluated different instillation techniques and assessed different outcomes, we performed no meta-analysis. One trial, conducted in the US, evaluated the effect of eyelid closure (one and three minutes) versus no eyelid closure on lowering IOP. At one to two weeks' follow-up, reduction in IOP was similar in the eyelid closure group and the no eyelid closure group (mean difference (MD) -0.33 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8 to 1.5; 51 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The second trial, conducted in Italy, evaluated the effect of using an absorbent cloth to wipe excess fluid after instillation (fluid removal) versus not using an absorbent cloth (no removal) on reducing dermatologic adverse events. At four months' follow-up, eyelashes were shorter among eyes in the fluid removal group compared with the no fluid removal group (MD -1.70 mm, 95% CI -3.46 to 0.06; 10 participants; low-certainty evidence). Fewer eyes showed skin hyperpigmentation in the eyelid region towards the nose in the fluid removal group compared with the no removal group (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.84; 10 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, the difference was uncertain in the eyelid region towards the temples (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.66; 10 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effect hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) was uncertain between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.98; 10 participants; low-certainty evidence). Neither trial reported other outcomes specified for this review, including the proportion of participants with IOP less than 21 mmHg; participant-reported outcomes related to the ease, convenience, and comfort of instillation techniques; physiologic measurements of systemic absorption; escalation of therapy; mean change in visual fields; optic nerve progression; mean change in best-corrected visual acuity; proportion in whom glaucoma developed; quality of life outcomes; or cost-effectiveness outcomes. Neither trial reported data at follow-up times of more than four months.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of topical medication instillation techniques for treatment of glaucoma is lacking. It is unclear what, if any, effects instillation techniques have on topical medical therapy for glaucoma.

### The effect of nasal steroid administration on intraocular pressure [^112HdbmP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The effect of systemic steroid administration on intraocular pressure (IOP) is well established. However less attention has been paid to the effect of steroids when administered in a nasal spray. We conducted a study to investigate a possible association between nasal steroids and elevated IOP in 54 patients who were being treated for allergic rhinitis. IOP was measured before the patients started therapy and thereafter every 5 days during that therapy. Follow-up ranged from 27 to 35 days (mean: 31). Statistical analysis revealed no significant elevation in IOP after nasal steroid administration. It seems that short-term administration of nasal steroids does not cause significant IOP elevation. Nevertheless, their long-term effects on this pressure should be investigated.

See FDA-approved labeling

17.1 Local Nasal Effect

Patients should be informed that treatment with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg may be associated with adverse reactions which include epistaxis (nose bleed) and nasal septum perforation. Candida infection may also occur. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg directly onto the nasal septum.

17.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Patients should be informed that nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg into the eyes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

17.3 Immunosuppression

Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles, and patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

17.4 Use Regularly for Best Effect

Patients should use NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg on a regular basis for optimal effect. Improvement in nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 1 to 2 days after initiation of dosing. Maximum benefit is usually achieved within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of dosing. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physician if symptoms do not improve, or if the condition worsens. Administration to young children should be aided by an adult.

If a patient missed a dose, the patient should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember. The patient should not take more than the recommended dose for the day.

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^113ZJ2sC]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

In a recent randomized and double-blinded study, 12 atopic mild stable asthmatic subjects were treated with placebo or mometasone furoate (100, 200 and 800 μg/d) for six days in a cross-over fashion. All three doses of MF demonstrated similar attenuation of early responses and allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness relative to placebo with no dose-response relationship. In contrast, the late maximal % fall in FEV 1 after placebo treatment was 24% and was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner to 12%, 11% and 6% for the 100, 200 and 800 μg daily treatments. The allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia (×10 4 cells/ml) 24 h after challenge during placebo treatment was 60.2 and was significantly reduced to 24.0, 15.3 and 6.2 for the 100, 200 and 800 μg daily treatments, respectively. Although a statistically significant dose-response relationship was present, the difference between the lowest and highest dose (8-fold difference) for late maximal fall in FEV 1 or allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia was less than the difference between placebo and the lowest dose of MF.

Taken together, the results suggest that there is tendency towards slightly higher anti-inflammatory efficacy with higher doses of ICS. At the moment there are only a few studies that assess the dose-dependency of the anti-inflammatory effects of ICS. Most of these studies included only small numbers of patients. However, despite the 4–8–16-fold differences in the doses of ICS studied, it has not been easy to demonstrate the dose-dependency of the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled glucocorticoids. Thus, based on the scarce published evidence we would predict that doubling of the commonly used low to moderate doses of ICS is likely to produce only a small increase in the anti-inflammatory effect, suggesting that inflammation may be suppressed in most patients by relatively low doses of ICS.

Is there a dose-response with the adverse effects of ICS?

Glucocorticoids suppress corticotrophin levels, which may eventually lead to atrophy of the adrenal cortex and diminished levels of endogenous cortisol. The diminished levels of endogenous cortisol or reduced cortisol excretion have been used as markers of systemic activity of ICS. These systemic effects may include osteoporosis, behavioural effects, growth suppression, posterior subcapsular cataracts, risk for ocular hypertension and glaucoma as well as skin thinning and bruising. In the following sections the literature on the dose-related effects of different steroids on HPA axis as well as on local adverse effects is discussed.

### The effect of long-term use of intranasal steroids on intraocular pressure [^111Kz81c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

IOP depends on humor aqueous secretion from the ciliary process and its excretion to episcleral veins via trabecular meshwork. However, both formation and excretion are balanced. There are some theories as to how steroid-induced IOP elevation occurs. Altered electrolyte imbalance, an increment in trabecular meshwork mucopolysaccharides, steroid-induced vasoconstriction in episcleral veins, and actin remodeling in trabecular meshwork can all lead to elevated IOP. It is also important to note that trabecular cells contain steroid receptors and this can be associated with resistance to the outflow of humor aqueous.–

The literature has reported contradictory findings regarding inhaler/nasal steroid usage and IOP. The first report about IOP and inhaled steroids was published in 1993 by Dreyer. Glaucoma was reported in three patients during treatment with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate. Opatowsky et alalso showed IOP elevation in three cases with inhaled and/or nasal beclomethasone dipropionate treatment. They concluded that this effect was reversible with elimination of the drugs. Moreover, Öztürk et alfollowed-up patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and who used budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate on average for 8.8 months, and no statistically significant increase in IOP was observed. Man et alperformed a similar study in which patients used fluticasone propionate for 6 weeks postoperatively, and neither IOP elevation nor posterior subcapsular cataract formation was observed. In a double-blind prospective experimental study, the effect of nasal steroids (fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and beclomethasone dipropionate) on the IOPs of patients with rhinitis was studied for 1 year; significant alteration in the IOPs, which were found to be within normal limits, was not observed. In our study, we encountered similar findings; no statistically significant elevation was observed in the IOP parameters during the 6-month period with fluticasone and mometasone nasal steroids.

### Effects of three nasal topical steroids in the intraocular pressure compartment [^113v292x]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, or beclomethasone dipropionate for the treatment of rhinitis produced, as a side effect, an increase in the intraocular pressure; only one printed article proclaims that the increase of secondary intraocular pressure is due to the use of local nasal steroids.

Patients and Study Design

We conducted a comparative, double-blind, experimental, prospective, longitudinal study in which 360 patients were divided at random into 4 groups; 90 of them were given a placebo (control group) and the other 270 were divided into 3 other groups of 90 patients each and given a different local nasal steroid for each group. Measurement parameters All patients had their intraocular pressure measured by Goldman's tonometry at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after using the placebo or local nasal steroid.

Results

Variations were found in the intraocular pressure of patients who used local steroid, with discreet elevations in the beclomethasone dipropionate and mometasone furoate groups; however, variations were always within normal limits.

Conclusion

Fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and beclomethasone dipropionate cause variations in the intraocular pressure, but the variations are within normal limits.

5.8 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the administration of inhaled corticosteroids including ALVESCO. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

In a comparator control study of one-year treatment duration, 743 patients 18 years of age and older (mean age 43.1 years) with moderate persistent asthma were treated with ALVESCO 320 mcg twice daily and 742 were treated with a labeled dose of a comparator-inhaled corticosteroid appropriate for the patient population. Patients had an ophthalmology examination that included visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurement, and a slit lamp examination at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. Lens opacities were graded using the Lens Opacification System III. After 52 weeks, CLASS I effects (minimally detected changes) were recorded in 36.1% of the ALVESCO-treated patients and in 38.4% of patients treated with the comparator-inhaled corticosteroid. The more severe CLASS III effects were recorded in 8.1% of the ALVESCO-treated patients and 9.2% of patients treated with the comparator-inhaled corticosteroid. Of those patients having a CLASS III effect, the incidence of posterior sub-capsular opacities was 0.9% and 0.5% in the ALVESCO- and comparator-treated patients, respectively.

5.9 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ALVESCO, it should be treated immediately with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Treatment with ALVESCO should be discontinued and alternative treatment should be instituted.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ScTUc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data Analysis and Synthesis

Meta-analysis was completed using Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4; The Nordic Cochrane Center, Copenhagen). Among the studies that passed inclusion criteria for qualitative review, studies were included in the meta-analysis if they reported data on the outcomes of interest as described below. Studies were excluded from quantitative meta-analysis and remained in qualitative review only, if their results did not provide sufficient detail regarding ocular outcomes, lacked quantitative outcomes, or did not have a clear control group. The main outcomes of interest were incidence of glaucoma and OHT, as well as mean ± SD of IOP in controls and patients before and after ICS or INS use. Incidence of new glaucoma diagnoses, OHT and IOP increase was expressed as number of cases per person-years (PPY) based on study follow-up, in order to allow weighted measurement of the incidence rate, and was used to calculate risk differences. For incidence of OHT, the clinical threshold chosen by each study was accounted for in subgroup analysis. For IOP, reported mean ± SD of ICS users, INS users, and controls before and after medication use were pooled for meta-analysis. For all outcomes, subgroup analyses pooled studies based on study methodology, separating RCT and NRSI to account for the different strength of evidence each design provides in summary estimates, and drug administration route, to examine whether proximity to ocular tissues could influence ophthalmic outcomes. Heterogeneity was tested by computing I 2 value and for low-heterogeneity studies (I 2 value < 50%), the fixed-effect model was used, while for high-heterogeneity studies (I 2 value ≥ 50%), the random-effect model was used. Sensitivity analyses were performed for large studies (> 1000 participants/person-years) and for studies with pediatric populations (< 18 years of age) versus adult population.

- **Growth delay**: use caution in pediatric patients.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome**: use caution in patients receiving high doses or susceptible patients receiving regular doses.
- **Immunosuppression**: use caution in patients with active or latent tuberculous, systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.
- **Increased serum mometasone levels**: use caution in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin.
- **Nasopharyngeal candidiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of nasopharyngeal candidiasis.
- **Nosebleed, nasal septum perforation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of local nasal effects.

### The effect of long-term use of intranasal steroids on intraocular pressure [^115m2NtN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Topical nasal steroids are widely used by otolaryngologists to treat allergic rhinitis (AR) patients for a long period of time. Prolonged use of these drugs can cause some adverse effects on eyes. The literature has reported posterior subcapsular cataract and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) levels with long-term use of intranasal steroids.

IOP has a circadian rhythm, and one study has described a relationship between plasma cortisol levels and IOP fluctuation. IOP can vary with age, systemic/local factors, and medications. Although systemic, topical or ophthalmic use of steroids can increase IOP, the effect of intranasal use of steroids on IOP is controversial.

This study aimed to investigate IOP alterations in AR patients using two common intranasal steroids for a 6-month period of time.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following:

Candida albicans infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Growth effects in pediatrics [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]
Glaucoma and cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

### Impact of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids exposure on the risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LzhG3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, overall analysis identified a statistically significant increase of 0.69 mmHg IOP in ICS or INS users compared to non-users. Subgroup analysis supported this finding only in NRSI INS studies, with a mean difference between groups of 1.21 mmHg.

There was no significant increase in IOP following ICS or INS use compared to patients' baseline. However, subgroup analysis identified a significant increase in IOP of 1.09 mmHg following ICS use in RCTs. Potentially, these differences are related to longer duration of use and follow-up (between 6 months and up to 4 years) compared to other groups (between 6 weeks and 1 year). Within this subgroup, the study by Chylack 2009possessed the greatest weight, resulting in a significant mean increase in IOP for the overall subgroup. Although this study was double-blinded, it lacked a placebo control group. Furthermore, there is well-documented evidence demonstrating that IOP measurements can fluctuate due to patient factors, timing, and evaluator variability. Therefore, caution is warranted when determining whether these results are truly clinically significant.

Overall lack of significant increases in glaucoma or OHT incidence suggests that the use of INS and ICS at the doses prescribed and over the periods studied are alone not a major risk factor. This conclusion, of course is reliant upon the definitions for glaucoma and OHT used in the various reported studies. On a per patient level, a 1 mmHg rise in IOP is unlikely clinically significant. However, at a population level, this number would be significant for a risk of development and progression of glaucoma, especially when patients already have a number of other risk factors for the disease.

Steroid-induced glaucoma is a well-known secondary cause of open-angle glaucoma. A third of the population is designated as steroid responders, as they are more likely to develop IOP elevation, OHT and glaucoma in response to topical ocular steroid administration. Up to 95% of these patients have a family history of glaucoma. Interestingly, many authors excluded patients with family history of glaucoma from enrollment in their studies, which may have resulted in an underestimation of risk by excluding potential steroid responders. As such, the current literature may be underestimating the risk of IOP increase, OHT and glaucoma incidence, which may limit applicability of the findings and of risk assessment to general population.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older

In controlled US and international clinical studies, a total of 3210 adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with allergic rhinitis received treatment with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg at doses of 50 to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients (n = 2103) were treated with 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 adult and adolescent patients have been treated for one year or longer. Adverse events did not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. Four percent or less of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse events and the discontinuation rate was similar for the vehicle and active comparators.

All adverse events (regardless of relationship to treatment) reported by 5% or more of adult and adolescent patients ages 12 years and older who received NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg, 200 mcg/day vs. placebo and that were more common with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg than placebo, are displayed in TABLE 1 below.

Other adverse events which occurred in less than 5% but greater than or equal to 2% of adult and adolescent patients (ages 12 years and older) treated with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg, 200-mcg/day (regardless of relationship to treatment), and more frequently than in the placebo group included: arthralgia, asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, dyspepsia, earache, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, nausea, and rhinitis.

Ocular Changes

For all treatments, ophthalmologic examinations revealed a low incidence of ocular events as defined by the percentage of patients with a LOCS III grade change of at least 1 unit during the study: MF/F 200/10 μg, 3.5% (n = 5); FP/S 250/50 μg, 5.9% (n = 4); MF/F 400/10 μg, 3.8% (n = 5); and FP/S 500/50 μg, 1.5% (n = 1). Furthermore, there was no report of posterior subcapsu-lar cataracts in any treatment group. Of the 15 patients reporting ocular changes, 5 experienced changes that were considered by the investigator as being possibly related to study treatment (all considered SAEs): 3 with a lens disorder, 1 with ocular hypertension (all MF/F 400/10 μg), and 1 with reduced visual acuity (FP/S 250/50 μg). Treatment was discontinued for two of the patients with lens disorder and the patient with reduced visual acuity.
