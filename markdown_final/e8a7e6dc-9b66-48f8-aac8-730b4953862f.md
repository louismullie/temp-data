## Question

What else from nitro i can give for chest pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what else from "nitro" can be given for chest pain, and what options exist in terms of nitrate formulations and alternatives when nitrates are contraindicated or ineffective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "nitro" typically refers to in practice. Then, I should verify the different nitrate formulations and their indications. Next, I will review contraindications and drug interactions that limit nitrate use. After that, I should consider alternative antianginal therapies when nitrates are not an option or are insufficient. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, scenario-based approach and ensure the recommendations align with current guidelines and safety data [^113cb9Yy] [^113PUmRb].

> Let me first confirm what "nitro" means in this context; I need to ensure we're not conflating nitroglycerin with other vasodilators. "Nitro" in cardiology almost always refers to nitroglycerin, an organic nitrate used for acute relief and prophylaxis of angina, and not to nitric oxide donors like sodium nitroprusside or to non-nitrate vasodilators, so I should keep the discussion anchored to nitrate therapy and its formulations [^115Hd14D] [^117K4tSP].

> Now, I will examine the nitrate formulations and their clinical roles; wait, let me verify onset and labeled uses so I don't overgeneralize. Sublingual tablets or spray provide rapid relief of acute angina and can be used prophylactically before exertion, with spray sometimes offering faster effect and less headache than tablets; intravenous nitroglycerin is titratable for persistent ischemic pain in ACS; long-acting oral nitrates and transdermal patches are for prevention, not for aborting acute attacks, and require a nitrate-free interval to mitigate tolerance; topical ointment is also preventive rather than abortive, so I should not suggest it for acute relief [^117CyQFy] [^113PUmRb] [^113cb9Yy] [^114JTcHq] [^114MvLXQ].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and key interactions before recommending escalation; I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and screen for PDE5 inhibitor use. Nitrates should be avoided in hypotension, right ventricular infarction, severe bradycardia or tachycardia without heart failure, and in the presence of recent PDE5 inhibitor use, with specific washout windows of 12 hours for avanafil, 24 hours for sildenafil/vardenafil, and 48 hours for tadalafil; relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin is not diagnostic of ischemia, so I should not let a nitrate response guide diagnosis or disposition [^113PUmRb] [^112Mg7gw] [^1157LRSk] [^116orube].

> Next, I should review alternatives when nitrates are contraindicated or insufficient; let me think about first-line antianginals and then second-line options. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are first-line for chronic coronary disease with angina, and if symptoms persist on one class, adding a second antianginal from a different class is recommended; ranolazine is guideline-endorsed for recurrent angina despite beta-blocker, CCB, or long-acting nitrate therapy; ivabradine can be considered when heart rate is high and limits symptom control; nicorandil is a potassium channel opener with antianginal benefit but is not available in the U.S.; trimetazidine is a metabolic modulator with supportive data but limited guideline endorsement in some regions; in acute settings with nitrate-refractory pain, morphine or fentanyl may be used cautiously for analgesia, recognizing potential delays in P2Y12 absorption and the need for close monitoring [^113cb9Yy] [^113fwhca] [^116dTCon] [^114oDPMj] [^113PUmRb].

> But wait, what if the chest pain is vasospastic rather than fixed-flow obstruction; I should confirm that calcium channel blockers are prioritized in vasospasm. For coronary artery vasospasm, guidelines favor calcium channel blockers as first-line, with long-acting nitrates as add-on therapy, and in some endotypes of INOCA with epicardial spasm, a stepwise approach of CCB, then long-acting nitrate, then nicorandil is reasonable; this reinforces that "what else from nitro" may mean choosing a non-nitrate first in vasospastic presentations [^112vG2hf] [^114oDPMj].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases; hold on, I should verify nuances in heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In heart failure with concomitant angina, nitrates and beta-blockers can improve symptoms, but non-dihydropyridine CCBs should generally be avoided in significant LV dysfunction; in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with angina-like symptoms, nitrates may be considered if there is no LV outflow tract obstruction, but they can worsen symptoms in obstructive physiology, so I need to check for LVOTO before prescribing [^112ELAWM] [^116mVbky].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it aligns with guidelines. If "nitro" means expanding within nitrate therapy, options include sublingual tablets, sublingual spray, IV nitroglycerin for persistent pain, and long-acting oral or transdermal nitrates for prevention with attention to tolerance and washout periods; if "nitro" is contraindicated or inadequate, escalate to beta-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers, then add ranolazine or consider ivabradine or other agents based on comorbidity and mechanism; in acute chest pain unresponsive to nitrates, consider IV nitrates if not contraindicated and use opioids judiciously for analgesia while pursuing definitive ACS care; throughout, I should confirm hemodynamics, screen for PDE5 inhibitors, and avoid using nitrate response diagnostically [^113cb9Yy] [^113PUmRb] [^116orube].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought transdermal nitroglycerin might help abort an acute attack because of sustained effect; let me reconsider and correct that. Transdermal systems and topical ointment have a slower onset and are indicated for prevention, not for acute relief, so for aborting an attack I should rely on sublingual or spray formulations or IV titration when appropriate, keeping long-acting forms for background therapy and ensuring a daily nitrate-free interval to limit tolerance [^114JTcHq] [^114MvLXQ] [^117CyQFy].

> Finally, I should confirm that the plan addresses diagnostic uncertainty and safety. Relief with nitroglycerin does not confirm ischemia, so I must integrate ECG, troponins, risk factors, and clinical trajectory; I need to ensure strict avoidance of nitrates with recent PDE5 inhibitor use and maintain vigilance for hypotension, bradycardia, and paradoxical responses; and if chest pain persists despite appropriate nitrate and antianginal therapy, I should escalate ACS care pathways rather than persisting with symptomatic treatment alone [^116orube] [^113PUmRb].

For chest pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin, escalate to **IV nitroglycerin** (start 10–20 mcg/min, titrate to pain relief and hemodynamic tolerance) [^113PUmRb] if not contraindicated [^1123fDnj]. If pain persists or IV nitrates are contraindicated, use **morphine 2–4 mg IV every 5–15 minutes** (max 10–15 mg) [^113PUmRb] or **fentanyl 25–50 mcg IV every 5–15 minutes** (max 100–200 mcg) [^113PUmRb] for analgesia and anxiolysis. Avoid nitrates in **right ventricular infarction**, severe hypotension, or recent PDE5 inhibitor use [^112Mg7gw]; monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression with opioids [^112ZrNwR]. If pain continues despite these measures, pursue urgent cardiology consultation and consider invasive strategies [^112VwZwq].

## Alternative nitrate formulations and routes of administration

### Intravenous nitroglycerin

- **Indication**: Persistent chest pain unresponsive to sublingual nitroglycerin in ACS or acute decompensated heart failure [^113PUmRb] [^112Mg7gw].
- **Dosing**: Start at 10–20 mcg/min, titrate by 5–10 mcg/min every 3–5 minutes to pain relief or hemodynamic tolerance; typical max 200 mcg/min.
- **Contraindications**: SBP < 90 mmHg, HR < 50 or > 100 bpm without HF, RV infarction, recent PDE5 inhibitor use [^112Mg7gw].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous BP/HR, frequent pain assessment, 12-lead ECGs; watch for hypotension, headache, tolerance [^113PUmRb].

---

### Long-acting nitrates

- **Indication**: Chronic angina prophylaxis, not for acute relief [^113cb9Yy].
- **Examples**: Isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, transdermal nitroglycerin patches [^114JTcHq].
- **Limitations**: Tolerance develops without a 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval; not for acute attacks [^111MSaw2].

---

## Non-nitrate pharmacological alternatives

Key characteristics of non-nitrate antianginal classes:

| **Aspect** | **Beta-blockers** | **Calcium channel blockers** |
|-|-|-|
| Indication | First-line for chronic angina; reduce heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, and ischemia [^113cb9Yy] | Alternative or add-on to beta-blockers; vasodilate coronaries, reduce afterload [^113cb9Yy] |
| Examples | Metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol | Diltiazem, verapamil, amlodipine |
| Limitations | Contraindicated in severe bradycardia, AV block, decompensated HF, severe asthma/COPD [^notfound] | Non-DHPs avoid in significant LV dysfunction; monitor for bradycardia and hypotension [^113fwhca] |

---

### Ranolazine

Ranolazine is **indicated for chronic angina refractory to beta-blockers, CCBs, or long-acting nitrates** [^116dTCon]. It reduces ischemia via late sodium current inhibition and is generally well tolerated; monitor for QT prolongation and drug interactions [^112P42g1].

---

### Ivabradine

Ivabradine is **indicated for chronic stable angina with elevated heart rate** when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. It lowers heart rate without affecting contractility; monitor for bradycardia, visual disturbances, and atrial fibrillation [^1168mabD].

---

### Nicorandil

Nicorandil is **indicated as add-on therapy for chronic angina**, particularly with microvascular dysfunction or vasospasm. It is a potassium channel opener with nitrate-like effects; monitor for headache, flushing, and rare ulcer complications [^112CxYQC].

---

## Analgesic alternatives for persistent chest pain

### Morphine sulfate

- **Indication**: Persistent chest pain unresponsive to nitrates in ACS; provides analgesia and anxiolysis [^113fNkBh].
- **Dosing**: 2–4 mg IV every 5–15 minutes, max 10–15 mg.
- **Risks**: Respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, delayed P2Y12 absorption; use cautiously [^112ZrNwR].

---

### Fentanyl

Fentanyl is an **alternative to morphine** for rapid, potent analgesia with less histamine release and hemodynamic instability. Dose 25–50 mcg IV every 5–15 minutes, up to 100–200 mcg total; monitor for respiratory depression and sedation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended alternative therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Persistent chest pain unresponsive to sublingual nitroglycerin | IV nitroglycerin | Escalation of nitrate therapy for rapid, titratable effect [^113PUmRb] |
| Contraindications to nitrates (e.g. severe hypotension, RV infarction) | Morphine or fentanyl | Provide analgesia without exacerbating hypotension [^113PUmRb] |
| Chronic stable angina | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine | Long-term symptom control and reduction of ischemic burden [^113cb9Yy] |
| Vasospastic angina | Calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates | Prevent coronary spasm and reduce frequency of angina episodes [^112vG2hf] |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Continuous BP/HR during IV nitroglycerin or opioid therapy [^notfound].
- **Respiratory monitoring**: Watch for opioid-related respiratory depression [^112ZrNwR].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors; review for QT-prolonging drugs with ranolazine [^1157LRSk].
- **Patient education**: Teach nitrate use, tolerance, and when to seek urgent care [^112Wiqxb].

---

When chest pain persists despite nitroglycerin, escalate to **IV nitroglycerin** or use **morphine/fentanyl** if nitrates are contraindicated or ineffective. For chronic management, use beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, ivabradine, or nicorandil based on comorbidities and tolerance. Always monitor hemodynamics and drug interactions, and seek cardiology input for refractory cases [^113PUmRb].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

Short‑acting nitrates for acute angina relief — practical use and comparative formulation data: Short‑acting nitrates help to relieve acute episodes of angina, and administering a short‑acting nitrate prior to activity that typically triggers symptoms can decrease symptoms. In randomized studies, nitroglycerin spray compared with a sublingual formulation is more effective and efficient at relieving angina, with less headache.

### Impact of nitrate use on survival in acute heart failure: a propensity-matched analysis [^114ukKKp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, among patients with ADHF presenting to the ED, nitrate therapy was not associated with a significant improvement in survival. Similarly, there was no survival benefit in clinical subgroups, including presence or absence of an abnormal serum troponin, known history of coronary artery disease, chronic nitrate use prior to ED presentation, or chest pain symptoms on presentation. Our study does not support the use of nitrates as a generic form of therapy for ADHF in the early ED setting, when the specific aim of its use is to reduce risk of mortality. However, the administration of nitrates acutely in the ED appeared to be safe, with no undue increase in mortality risk. Therefore, its use to improve symptoms and clinical status in ADHF is reasonable. Further prospective studies with specific nitrate protocols are needed to further clarify the efficacy and safety of this medication.

### Best evidence topic report. cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia: nitrates versus benzodiazepines [^1111AFHD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.

### Angina (chronic stable) [^113eN98s]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stable angina is usually caused by coronary atherosclerosis, and affects up to 16% of men and 10% of women aged 65–74 years in the UK. Risk factors include hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol levels, smoking, physical inactivity, and overweight. People with angina are at increased risk of other cardiovascular events and mortality compared with people without angina. Among people not thought to need coronary artery revascularisation, annual mortality is 1–2% and the annual non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) rate is 2–3%.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are effects of long-term drug treatment for stable angina? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the long-term effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates, potassium channel openers, combinations of these anti-anginal drug treatments and the use of these anti-anginal drug treatment as an adjunct to existing therapies.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112Mg7gw]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Nitroglycerin — an anti-anginal nitrate — has pharmacologic action as an "Organic nitrate which causes systemic venodilation, decreasing preload", with additional effects that "reduce both preload and afterload, and myocardial O2 demand" and may "Lower BP, increase heart rate, occasional paradoxical bradycardia". Indications are "As an anti-anginal medication for the management of chest pain as well as a reducer of preload for patients suffering from acute pulmonary edema". Contraindications include "Hypersensitivity, acute myocardial infarction, severe anemia, recent use of erectile dysfunction medications (sildenafil (Viagra® — within last 24 hours), tadalafil (Cialis® — within last 48 hours), vardenafil (Levitra® — within last 48 hours), or other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors)", with a note of "narrow angle glaucoma (controversial: may not be clinically significant)". Nitrates are contraindicated in the presence of "hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or ≥ 30 mmHg below baseline), extreme bradycardia (less than 50 BPM), tachycardia in the absence of heart failure (greater than 100 BPM), and right ventricular infarction".

### Nitroglycerin [^112Wiqxb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should I take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets?

Do not chew, crush, or swallow nitroglycerin sublingual tablets.
You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and use caution when you stand up. This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness.
One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain.
The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved.
If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or is different than you typically experience, call your doctor or seek emergency help.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used 5 minutes to 10 minutes prior to activities that might cause chest pain.
You may feel a burning or tingling sensation in your mouth when you take nitroglycerin sublingual tablets.

What should I avoid while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets?

Do not breastfeed. It is not known if nitroglycerin will pass through your milk.
Do not consume alcohol while taking nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, as this can lower your blood pressure.
Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1124daC5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

It is difficult to prove antianginal effects in patients on multiple background medications. Although our findings indicate at most modest effects of nitrate when it is given as add‐on therapy, we cannot rule out a stronger benefit if given as a monotherapy. However, we believe that the strength of our study lies in the analysis of real‐life clinical scenarios including patients with multiple comorbidities on polypharmacy. The crossover design made it possible to account for this variation. Chronic angina patients would be very unlikely to be treated with inorganic nitrate monotherapy in the presence of potent first‐line anti‐anginals, and similar studies would be ethically difficult to defend. In this context, it is quite exciting that a dietary treatment strategy has modest benefits on exercise capacity without lowering BP or heart rate. No current standard antianginal medication offers any prognostic benefit for the patients. In the context of a trend to increased time to 1‐mm ST depression and a significantly increased total exercise capacity together with the well‐described prognostic benefit of a nitrate‐rich Mediterranean diet or the fruit‐ and vegetable‐rich DASH diet, 2, 48, 57 it appears appropriate to recommend that angina patients adhere to the above diets. Although the treatment period was relatively short (in order to avoid interference of natural disease progression on the outcome analysis in this crossover design), the supplementation resulted in better exercise performance. The results of a longer‐term supplementation will need to be established in further studies. Although rare and usually mild, nausea and vomiting were reported. Patients ought to be alerted to this possible adverse effect.

### Time-honored treatments for the initial management of acute coronary syndromes: challenging the status quo [^114RWu8c]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Morphine, oxygen, and nitrates are time-honored therapies for the initial management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The traditional goal of these agents in ACS has been to (1) relieve symptoms, (2) prevent infarction or limit its size, and (3) improve outcomes, both acutely and during follow-up. Despite their ongoing use in routine ACS care, nitrates, morphine, and oxygen have no evidence of clinical outcomes benefit from randomized trials. Furthermore, emerging data have recently suggested that, in certain situations, morphine and oxygen may actually be associated with harm in the setting of ACS. In this review article, we thoroughly examine updated evidence for each of these acute-phase ACS agents with respect to their individual risks and benefits. We review guideline recommendations for these therapies and outline future directions for their use in clinical practice.

Patient Information

Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets, USP

(nahy-truh-glis-er-in)

Read this information carefully before you start nitroglycerin sublingual tablets and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are right for you.

What is Nitroglycerin?

Nitroglycerin is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina.

What is Angina?

Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain.

Who should not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets?

Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin sublingual tablets).

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114mcCK6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In this double‐blind randomized placebo‐controlled crossover trial, we investigated whether oral sodium nitrate, when added to existing background medication, reduces exertional ischemia in patients with angina.

Methods and Results

Seventy patients with stable angina, positive electrocardiogram treadmill test, and either angiographic or functional test evidence of significant ischemic heart disease were randomized to receive oral treatment with either placebo or sodium nitrate (600 mg; 7 mmol) for 7 to 10 days, followed by a 2‐week washout period before crossing over to the other treatment (n = 34 placebo‐nitrate, n = 36 nitrate‐placebo). At baseline and at the end of each treatment, patients underwent modified Bruce electrocardiogram treadmill test, modified Seattle Questionnaire, and subgroups were investigated with dobutamine stress, echocardiogram, and blood tests. The primary outcome was time to 1 mmdepression on electrocardiogram treadmill test. Compared with placebo, inorganic nitrate treatment tended to increase the primary outcome exercise time to 1 mmsegment depression (645.6 [603.1, 688.0] seconds versus 661.2 [6183, 704.0] seconds, P = 0.10) and significantly increased total exercise time (744.4 [702.4, 786.4] seconds versus 760.9 [719.5, 802.2] seconds, P = 0.04; mean [95% confidence interval]). Nitrate treatment robustly increased plasma nitrate (18.3 [15.2, 21.5] versus 297.6 [218.4, 376.8] μmol/L, P < 0.0001) and almost doubled circulating nitrite concentrations (346 [285, 405] versus 552 [398, 706] nmol/L, P = 0.003; placebo versus nitrate treatment). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly altered by the intervention. Patients on antacid medication appeared to benefit less from nitrate supplementation.

Conclusions

Sodium nitrate treatment may confer a modest exercise capacity benefit in patients with chronic angina who are taking other background medication.

### Expert consensus document: A' diamond'approach to personalized treatment of angina [^113iVktZ]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

In clinical guidelines, drugs for symptomatic angina are classified as being first choice (β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, short-acting nitrates) or second choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine), with the recommendation to reserve second-choice medications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. No direct comparisons between first-choice and second-choice treatments have demonstrated the superiority of one group of drugs over the other. Meta-analyses show that all antianginal drugs have similar efficacy in reducing symptoms, but provide no evidence for improvement in survival. The newer, second-choice drugs have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary than is available for traditional first-choice drugs. Considering some drugs, but not others, to be first choice is, therefore, difficult. Moreover, double or triple therapy is often needed to control angina. Patients with angina can have several comorbidities, and symptoms can result from various underlying pathophysiologies. Some agents, in addition to having antianginal effects, have properties that could be useful depending on the comorbidities present and the mechanisms of angina, but the guidelines do not provide recommendations on the optimal combinations of drugs. In this Consensus Statement, we propose an individualized approach to angina treatment, which takes into consideration the patient, their comorbidities, and the underlying mechanism of disease.

Medical therapy for relief of angina — class 1 recommendations for chronic coronary disease (CCD) state that in patients with CCD and angina, antianginal therapy with either a beta blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), or long-acting nitrate is recommended (1 B-R). In patients who remain symptomatic after initial treatment, addition of a second antianginal agent from a different therapeutic class (beta blockers, CCBs, long-acting nitrates) is recommended (1 B-R). In patients with CCD, ranolazine is recommended in patients with recurrent symptomatic angina despite treatment with beta blockers, CCB, or long-acting nitrate therapies (1 B-R). For immediate short-term relief, sublingual nitroglycerin or nitroglycerin spray is recommended (1 B-NR).

What is NITROSTAT?

NITROSTAT is a type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina.

What is Angina?

Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. NITROSTAT can relieve this pain.

Who should not use NITROSTAT?

Do not use NITROSTAT if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in NITROSTAT).

You should not take NITROSTAT if you have the following conditions:

very recent heart attack
severe anemia
increased pressure in the head

Do not take NITROSTAT with drugs for erectile dysfunction, like VIAGRA®(sildenafil citrate), CIALIS®(tadalafil), or LEVITRA®(vardenafil hydrochloride), as this may lead to extreme lowering of your blood pressure.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^11546ujb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics

More than 1600 patients with a diagnosis of angina were invited to participate. Following telephone or clinic interview only 213 potentially suitable patients gave informed consent and were invited for detailed screening investigations. Of these 70 patients were found to be eligible and were randomized (Figure 1, Table 1). 44 With overall 93.6% of patients taking all their capsules correctly as prescribed (131 out of 140 treatment periods) the compliance was high. All patients attending for their final day visit took their last capsules in the morning as planned (Data S1 and Table S1).

Table 1
Demographics

Electrocardiogram Treadmill Test

The time from the last nitrate capsule ingestion to start of the treadmill test was 154.0 (139.5‐169.3) minutes (median [interquartile range]). During the nitrate treatment, relative to placebo, there were trends toward reduction of various manifestations of ischemia including time to 1‐mm ST depression, time to onset of chest pain, and total exercise time (Figure 2). However, only changes in total exercise time were statistically significant (median [95% confidence interval] 760.9 [719.5, 802.2] versus 744.4 [702.4, 786.4] seconds, P = 0.04), whereas for time to 1‐mm ST depression (661.2 [618.3, 704.0] versus 645.6 [603.1, 688.0] seconds, nitrate versus placebo, P = 0.10). There was a significant treatment and period interaction effect with respect to total exercise time, but inclusion of this interaction term made no material difference to the treatment effect estimate.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

17.1 Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of STENDRA with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. Patients should be counseled that concomitant use of STENDRA with nitrates could cause blood pressure to suddenly drop to an unsafe level, resulting in dizziness, syncope, or even heart attack or stroke.

Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of STENDRA. In such a patient, who has taken STENDRA, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 12 hours should elapse after the last dose of STENDRA before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking STENDRA should seek immediate medical attention [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.2 Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and should seek immediate medical attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.3 Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for STENDRA to augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and other antihypertensive medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

17.4 Potential for Drug Interactions

Patients should be advised to contact the prescribing physician if new medications that may interact with STENDRA are prescribed by another healthcare provider.

17.5 Priapism

There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Physicians should advise patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, to seek emergency medical attention.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115FdJih]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In our study population there were no differences in Modified Seattle Questionnaire, use of GTN, or angina between treatment arms. It has to be noted that the latter 3 secondary outcomes were always felt to be particularly weak end points for this particular study design; nevertheless, we felt they should be reported. The treatment arms were short, and angina episodes and GTN use were less frequently reported than expected during the individual test weeks (< 1 per treatment period, Table 2).

Nowadays, revascularization is performed rapidly after listing for a procedure. Therefore, we elected a relatively short treatment period (7 to 10 days) to avoid interference with potential clinical revascularization plans. We cannot exclude a greater effect with a longer treatment period.

Many of our patients were elderly, had multivessel disease, and over years adapted their lifestyle to avoid angina. There was a clear discrepancy between their infrequent subjective reporting of angina despite objective severe disease, limiting chest pain on treadmill testing, and electrocardigraphic and echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia on functional testing. Even patients who on screening in their own description belonged to Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III were objectively limited on exercise at low workload but reported only 1 or even no angina episodes and little GTN use during the test weeks later. Consequently, the study was underpowered for these secondary end points. Despite previous reports of proangiogenic markers in skeletal muscle (animal model) and plasma in healthy volunteers, we observed no increase in systemic proangiogenic markers in our angina population.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### The on-and off-target effects of morphine in acute coronary syndrome: a narrative review [^112ZrNwR]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

With potent analgesic properties, perceived hemodynamic benefits and limited alternatives, morphine is the analgesic mainstay for patients with nitrate resistant chest pain due to acute Myocardial Infarction (MI). However, observational data suggest that morphine administration during MI may have negative consequences. While vomiting, hypotension and respiratory depression are established side effects, recent reports have demonstrated attenuated and delayed oral anti-platelet agent absorption, as well as suboptimal reperfusion after MI, all of which may translate into adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These data have resulted in reduced support for morphine in recent European and U.S. clinical practice guidelines for MI; despite the absence of any prospective randomized outcomes trials addressing this question. As such, randomized trials are now necessary to confirm whether or not morphine, which is administered in up to 30% of MI cases, causes adverse clinical outcomes in these patients. However, given that placebo-controlled randomized trial designs evaluating morphine in MI are limited by an ethical requirement for appropriate analgesia, alternative investigational approaches may be necessary. In this article we review the updated evidence for morphine in MI and outline novel strategies that may facilitate future investigation of this clinical dilemma.

Results

Study Cohort

After applying the exclusion criteria to all 18 503 patients considered for study entry, the final study cohort was 11 078 patients, of whom 5948 were from the EFFECT‐HF database and 5130 were from the EHMRG database (Figure 1). Death occurred in 2540 (22.9%) patients at 1 year and 7131 (64.4%) at the end of the study, and there were no losses to follow‐up. Of the study participants with ADHF, 28.5% received any form of nitrates in the ED.

Figure 1
Patient flow diagram.

Clinical Characteristics Associated With Early Nitrate Exposure

While there were no significant differences in age, sex, or socioeconomic status, nitrate recipients exhibited indicators of greater clinical severity, including higher presenting heart rate, respiratory rate, and a lower initial oxygen saturation. Patients who were prescribed nitrates in the ED were more likely to have arrived by ambulance and present with chest pain compared to non‐nitrate recipients. More had a known history of coronary artery disease, systolic left ventricular dysfunction, troponin above the upper limit of normal, and ST‐ or T‐wave abnormalities on the 12‐lead ECG (Table 1).

Chest pain was more prevalent among patients administered nitrates (22.3%, n = 702) than compared to those not receiving nitrates (16.5%, n = 1310) in the ED (P < 0.001). Pharmacologically, they were more likely to have used nitrates prior to hospital presentation and to have used other cardiac medications in the ED including anti‐platelet agents, β‐adrenoreceptor antagonists, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system antagonists, and digoxin (Table 1). Using the EHMRG risk score, 17 the predicted probability of 7‐day death was 0.7% (mean risk score −2.1 ± 58.7) in the nitrate and 0.7% (mean risk score −12.0 ± 54.5) in non‐nitrate groups.

"It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

### Chronic refractory angina pectoris: recent progress and remaining challenges [^114ZZ3B8]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

While this clearly represents a step forward in the establishment of vascular gene therapy for reducing myocardial ischaemia, a few critical questions remain.
What was the exact definition used for chronic refractory angina in the patient selection of this trial? Does this definition discriminate between atypical and typical angina as established in the ESC guidelines on stable angina. Moreover, can patients with a component of non-cardiac chest pain be excluded with certainty?
Has medical antiangiogenic treatment been optimized and maximized in all patients? Ranolazine or ivabradine have not been mentioned in the list of drug therapy. Likewise, the intensity of nitrate use had not been monitored in the curent trial as was done in other trials on CRAP. In any case, optimized medical therapy at the time of patient inclusion in the study would be important to minimize variability of the clinical outcome during the course of the study.
Is improvement of regional myocardial perfusion an adequate endpoint of a trial for CRAP? Previous studies of similar size studying CRAP patients had been able to document a therapeutic improvement in myocardial perfusion as well, and this had been correlated with reduction in symptoms. A reduction of angina symptoms would be the most important goal to be achieved in these patients that warrant therapeutic improvement.
Is a randomization design of 4:1 (treated vs. control) adequate for a phase I/II trial? This is certainly a crucial point in the study by Hartikainen et al. which concludes that the improvement in CCS (Canadian Cardiovascular Society) class reached statistical significance in the treatment group, but not in the control group. However, this conclusion is potentially biased as the average reduction in symptoms (CCS class) was rather similar in both groups. The reason why the improvement in the control group was not statistically significant may be based on the fact that the control group was much smaller (n = 6) compared with the treatment group (n = 24), therefore making this phase I/II study rather sensitive for being driven by any play of chance. On the other hand, we should be aware that this study has not been powered for any solid conclusion regarding efficacy. This will be the subject of the phase II trial that has been set up based on the safety data from the current trial (see below).
The small number of individuals in this study should call for caution in interpreting any other 'outcome' data including any correlation with the potential biomarker Lipoprotein(a).

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

### Impact of nitrate use on survival in acute heart failure: a propensity-matched analysis [^111JgEVf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence that the use of nitrates in acute decompensated heart failure early after presentation to a hospital can improve clinical outcomes. We aimed to determine whether early nitrate exposure is associated with improved survival in a large retrospective cohort study.

Methods and Results

We examined 11 078 acute decompensated heart failure patients who presented to emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, between 2004 and 2007, in the Enhanced Feedback For Effective Cardiac Treatment and the Emergency Heart failure Mortality Risk Grade studies. In propensity‐matched analyses, we examined the effect of nitrate administration in the acute emergency department setting for its impact on death at 7, 30, and 365 days. In propensity‐matched analyses, we found no difference in survival between those who received nitrates in the emergency department and the non‐nitrate comparator group. Hazard ratios for mortality were 0.76 (95%; 0.51, 1.12) over 7 days, 0.97 (95%; 0.77, 1.21) over 30 days, and 0.91 (95%; 0.82, 1.02) over 1 year of follow‐up. There was no significant difference in survival or hospital length of stay between nitrate and non‐nitrate controls in extended follow‐up. There was also no significant effect of nitrates in subgroups stratified by presence of chest pain, troponin elevation, chronic nitrate use, and known coronary artery disease.

Conclusions

In acute decompensated heart failure, use of nitrates acutely in the emergency department setting was not associated with improvement in short‐term or near‐term survival. Our study does not support generalized use of nitrates when the primary goal of therapy is to reduce mortality.

### Nitrates as an integral part of optimal medical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: review of current concepts and therapeutics [^117CyE89]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The goals of optimal medical therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris are to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and future cardiovascular events, improve exercise capacity, and enhance quality of life. Whereas myocardial revascularization is frequently employed in the management of patients with stable angina, a variety of pharmacologic interventions are recommended as part of optimal medical management. The use of short- and rapidly-acting nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin spray and tablets) is at the core of the therapeutic armamentarium and should be integrated into optimal medical therapy for stable angina along with exercise therapy. The potential clinical implications from these observations are that prophylactic sublingual nitrates, when combined with cardiac rehabilitation, may allow the patient with angina to exercise to a greater functional capacity than without sublingual nitrates.

What are Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets?

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are type of medicine known as an organic nitrate and is a vasodilating agent. It is used to treat a type of chest pain called angina.

What is Angina?

Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can relieve this pain.

Who should not use Nitroglycerin Sublingual Tablets?

Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets if you are allergic to organic nitrates (like the active ingredient in nitroglycerin).

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antianginal therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-acting nitrates or ranolazine as add-on therapy in patients with inadequate control of symptoms while on treatment with β-blockers and/or CCBs, or as part of initial treatment in properly selected patients.

### Management of vasospastic angina [^113fzk68]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasospastic angina is a well-established cause of chest pain that is caused by coronary artery spasm. It can be clinically diagnosed during a spontaneous episode by documenting nitrate-responsive rest angina with associated transient ischaemic ECG changes but more often requires provocative coronary spasm testing with acetylcholine during coronary angiography. Vasospastic angina may result in recurrent episodes of angina (including nocturnal angina), which can progress on to major adverse cardiac events. Calcium channel blockers are first-line therapy for this condition, given their anti-anginal and cardioprotective benefits. Despite an established diagnostic and therapeutic management pathway for vasospastic angina, this diagnosis is often overlooked in patients presenting with chest pain. Thus, there is need for increased clinical awareness of vasospastic angina to improve outcomes in affected patients.

### Nicorandil for angina – an update [^11677a7T]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Around 2 million people in the UK have angina pectoris and are therefore at high risk of severe coronary events such as myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden death. Conventional management of patients with stable angina includes glyceryl trinitrate, a beta-blocker, aspirin and a statin, with the aim of controlling symptoms and reducing the risk of a coronary event. For patients unable to tolerate a beta-blocker, the choice is less clear but calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates provide effective symptom control. Another option is nicorandil (Ikorel — Rhône-Poulenc Rorer), a potassium channel activator licensed for the "prevention and long term treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris". In our review of nicorandil 8 years ago, we concluded that it provided symptom control that was as good as, but no better than, other less expensive anti-anginal drugs. Since then, new data have suggested that nicorandil might reduce the frequency of coronary events in patients with stable angina. Here, we consider these findings and reassess the place of nicorandil for patients with angina.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — drug selection and combination strategies emphasizes that beta blockers have been considered the first antianginal to use in patients with symptomatic CCD, although the evidence basis for this prioritization is not strong. Early randomized, placebo-controlled studies found that beta blockers increased the percentage of patients free of exertional angina, reduced anginal attacks and reduced nitroglycerin consumption. A meta-analysis of 72 studies comparing beta blockers with CCBs found fewer episodes of angina per week with beta blockers and lower rates of drug discontinuation, with no difference observed in the rate of death or MI between the 2 drug classes and no difference in the primary endpoint of exercise duration in a more recent meta-analysis. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CCBs effectively relieve angina, decrease nitroglycerin consumption, and increase exercise duration, and long-acting nitrates decrease angina and improve exercise duration. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) can further depress LV function and should not be used in patients with CCD and significant LV dysfunction; in patients with CCD and angina refractory to 1 agent, a combination with another antianginal agent improves symptom control, and non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be used with caution in patients on beta blockers because of the potential for synergistic induction or exacerbation of bradycardia and LV dysfunction; the addition of a long-acting nitrate to a beta blocker or a CCB improves exercise tolerance, reduces angina frequency and short-acting nitrate use. Control of symptoms may be achieved by most patients, but full freedom from angina is only achieved in 40% to 50%, depending on anginal frequency at the onset of treatment.

### Cardiovascular considerations during Cancer therapy: gaps in evidence andExpert Panel Recommendations [^112RNzFY]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

There is currently no clear consensus on the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of 5-FU-associated coronary vasospasm. Patients exhibiting suspected 5-FU-associated vasospasm should be referred to an emergency department, where 5-FU administration is paused, and nitrates are administered acutely. Discontinuing 5-FU administration typically resolves the chest pain. Many health care centers also recommend work-up for obstructive coronary disease; in the acute cases, many patients undergo coronary angiography because of electrocardiographic changes and the presence of chest pain.

There are no definitive data on the optimal management of patients experiencing 5-FU vasospasm. However, some studies suggest benefits from prophylactic use of nitrates, or calcium-channel blockersor switching from infusional to bolus-only 5-FUto reduce the likelihood of recurrent vasospasm. When considering a rechallenge, it is often advised to use a combination of the aforementioned cardioprotective medications. If a permissive CTR-CVT approach is desired, rechallenging the patient in an inpatient setting should be considered, especially when there is clear evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Alternatively, for patients who exhibit early-onset, severe, or life-threatening toxicity occurring within 96 hours after the administration of 5-FU or capecitabine, uridine triacetate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use.

Other therapies

Rechallenging patients with other cancer therapies, such as various TKIs, VEGFIs, and ICIs after the development of CTR-CVT may be considered. However, the support for the efficacy and safety of permissive cardiotoxicity with these agents is currently limited, with evidence drawn only from case reports and small case series. Consequently, there are insufficient data to form evidence-informed recommendations. Clinical decision making should be individualized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's goals of care and involving cancer specialists and cardiologists in the process.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^111MSaw2]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Isosorbide dinitrate and other nitrates — symptomatic therapy in heart failure (HF) — may decrease dyspnea and improve exercise tolerance in patients with persistent limitations, with the only common side effects being headaches and hypotension; in practice, nitrates are frequently prescribed to patients with persistent congestive symptoms, and nitrate tolerance appears minimized by a "nitrate-free interval" of at least 10 hours and by combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or hydralazine.

### Anti-anginal drugs-beliefs and evidence: systematic review covering 50 years of medical treatment [^1138Vzvo]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic stable angina is the most prevalent symptom of ischaemic heart disease and its management is a priority. Current guidelines recommend pharmacological therapy with drugs classified as being first line (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, short acting nitrates) or second line (long-acting nitrates, ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and trimetazidine). Second line drugs are indicated for patients who have contraindications to first line agents, do not tolerate them or remain symptomatic. Evidence that one drug is superior to another has been questioned. Between January and March 2018, we performed a systematic review of articles written in English over the past 50years English-written articles in Medline and Embase following preferred reporting items and the Cochrane collaboration approach. We included double blind randomized studies comparing parallel groups on treatment of angina in patients with stable coronary artery disease, with a sample size of, at least, 100 patients (50 patients per group), with a minimum follow-up of 1 week and an outcome measured on exercise testing, duration of exercise being the preferred outcome. Thirteen studies fulfilled our criteria. Nine studies involved between 100 and 300 patients, (2818 in total) and a further four enrolled greater than 300 patients. Evidence of equivalence was demonstrated for the use of beta-blockers (atenolol), calcium antagonists (amlodipine, nifedipine), and channel inhibitor (ivabradine) in three of these studies. Taken all together, in none of the studies was there evidence that one drug was superior to another in the treatment of angina or to prolong total exercise duration. There is a paucity of data comparing the efficacy of anti-anginal agents. The little available evidence shows that no anti-anginal drug is superior to another and equivalence has been shown only for three classes of drugs. Guidelines draw conclusions not from evidence but from clinical beliefs.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina: treatment [^117XfQQ2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Medical therapy versus myocardial revascularization in chronic coronary syndrome and stable angina [^114aNenx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. Angina is encountered frequently in clinical practice. Effective management of patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina should consist of therapy aimed at symptom control and reduction of adverse clinical outcomes. Therapeutic options for angina include antianginal drugs: nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and myocardial revascularization. Recent trials have shown that although revascularization is slightly better in controlling symptoms, optimal medical therapy that includes aggressive risk factor modification is equally effective in reducing the risk of future coronary events and death. On the basis of the available data, it seems appropriate to prescribe optimal medical therapy in most patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, and reserve myocardial revascularization for selected patients with disabling symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion.

### Myocardial bridge: bridging the differential diagnosis [^115bBw21]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 50-year-old man with a history of vasospastic angina diagnosed 3months prior presented with recurrent episodes of substernal chest pain. His chest pain was characterised as 'squeezing', lasting 10 min and typically occurred on awakening. Medications included isosorbide, nitroglycerin and ranolazine; however, due to lack of insurance he was unable to obtain these medications. On admission, patient was given a full-dose aspirin and nitroglycerin, which acutely worsened his chest pain. ECG did not reveal ischaemic changes and initial troponin was negative. A left heart catheterisation was conducted, revealing a myocardial bridge of the mid-left anterior descending artery. Myocardial bridge, due to its rarity, is often overlooked as an aetiology for angina, myocardial ischaemia, acute coronary syndrome, syncope and cardiac death. This case highlights the importance of broadening the differential to include myocardial bridge in the work-up for chest pain, especially if nitrates worsen symptoms.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^116brJ8p]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Risk

ENTADFI is contraindicated in patients taking any form of organic nitrate, either regularly and/or intermittently [see Contraindications (4)]. Discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of ENTADFI. In such a patient, who has taken ENTADFI, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of ENTADFI before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, advise patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking ENTADFI to seek immediate medical attention [see Contraindications (4)].

Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for tadalafil, and therefore until further information is available, ENTADFI is not recommended for the following groups of patients:

myocardial infarction within the last 90 days
unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse
New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months
uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension
stroke within the last 6 months.

As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil, a component of ENTADFI, has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing ENTADFI, carefully consider whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

### Isorbide dinitrate [^115N6qV5]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

General: Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of isosorbide dinitrate. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by isosorbide dinitrate may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

As tolerance to isosorbide dinitrate develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted.

Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the daily dose-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of controlled-release oral isosorbide dinitrate is not known.

In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumable high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence.

Information for Patients: Patients should be told that the anti-anginal efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate is strongly related to its dosing regimen, so the prescribed schedule of dosing should be followed carefully. In particular, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with isosorbide dinitrate. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with isosorbide dinitrate, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of anti-anginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve isosorbide dinitrate-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on isosorbide dinitrate's antianginal efficacy.

Treatment with isosorbide dinitrate may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.

Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of isosorbide dinitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.

### Chest pain relief by nitroglycerin does not predict active coronary artery disease [^114nKjW6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The belief that chest pain relief with nitroglycerin indicates the presence of active coronary artery disease is common. However, this hypothesis has not been tested.

Objective

To define the diagnostic and prognostic value of chest pain relief with nitroglycerin.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Urban community teaching hospital.

Patients

459 consecutive patients with chest pain admitted through the emergency department who received nitroglycerin from emergency services personnel or an emergency department nurse. Follow-up was obtained by telephone contact at 4 months.

Measurements

Chest pain relief was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in patients' self-reported pain within 5 minutes of the initial dose of sublingual or spray nitroglycerin. Active coronary artery disease was defined as any elevated serum enzyme levels, coronary angiography demonstrating a 70% or greater stenosis, or a positive exercise test result.

Results

Nitroglycerin relieved chest pain in 39% of patients (181 of 459). In patients with active coronary artery disease as the likely cause of their chest pain, 35% (49 of 141) had chest pain relief with nitroglycerin. In contrast, in patients without active coronary artery disease, 41% (113 of 275) had chest pain relief (P > 0.2). Four-month clinical outcomes were similar in patients with or without chest pain relief with nitroglycerin (P > 0.2).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in a general population admitted for chest pain, relief of pain after nitroglycerin treatment does not predict active coronary artery disease and should not be used to guide diagnosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nitroglycerine as a' test of treatment' for cardiac chest pain: a systematic review [^1131TZ1x]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the accuracy of using nitroglycerine as a 'test of treatment' in the diagnosis of cardiac chest pain we undertook a systematic review of studies of diagnostic accuracy. Databases searched included PubMed, Cochrane Database, Google Scholar, Science Citation Index, EMBASE and manual searching of bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Studies were included if sublingual nitroglycerine was the index test, its effect on the patient's pain score was recorded and the reference test was performed on at least 80% of patients. The data from the five papers were used to form 2×2 contingency tables. Five eligible studies were found, all in the acute setting (although one paper collected its data in the follow-up setting, all patients had acute presentations). The sensitivity ranged from 35% to 92% and the specificity from 12% to 63%. However, in all but one paper the Youden indices were close to zero suggesting that the response to nitroglycerine is not useful as a diagnostic test. The combined sensitivity was 0.52 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.56) and combined specificity was 0.49 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.52). The diagnostic OR from the combined studies was 1.2 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.5), which is not significantly different from 1. In the acute setting, nitroglycerine is not a reliable test of treatment for use in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. However, further studies are needed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of nitroglycerine for recurrent exertional chest pain.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^112z6bcA]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

As previously mentioned, chest pain with non-demonstrable ischaemia may appear, persist or be cyclic, even related to menstruation (catamenial chest pain). This can result very disconcerting and frustrating for patients. A trial switching beta-blockers for nitrates, calcium channel blockers or even more modern antianginal drugs can be attempted. For refractory catamenial chest pain in premenstrual women, local or systemic hormonal contraception to stabilise the menstrual cycle may be considered after failure of antianginal drugs.

Regarding hormonal treatment in patients with SCAD, no compelling evidence conveys contraindication of these therapies. However, it seems reasonable to avoid them if an alternative is available (contraception barrier methods, local or non-hormonal treatment for menopausal symptoms), as well as using progestin-only-based methods over the combination with oestrogen.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^113ZdeaB]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological

Although NICE guidelines offer either BB or CCB first line, although we support BB initially because they are generally better tolerated (table 2). Long-term evidence of efficacy is limited between BB and CCB and there are no proven safety concerns favouring one or the other. Dihydropyridine calcium may be added to BB if blood pressure permits. NICE CG126 states third line options can be either added on (or substituted if BB/CCB not tolerated). These include nitrates (eg, isosorbide mononitrate 30–120 mg controlled release), ivabradine (eg, 2.5–7.5 mg two times a day), nicorandil (5–30 mg two times a day) or ranolazine (375–500 mg two times a day). These are all third line medications that can be used based and combined with BB and/or CCB depending on comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference and drug costs (figure 3). The RIVER-PCI study found that anti-ischaemic pharmacotherapy with ranolazine did not improve the prognosis of patients with incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous coronary intervention. This was a reminder that alleviation of ischaemia may not improve 'hard' endpoints in patients with chronic coronary syndromes but helps us to remain focused on improving their quality of life.

### Isosorbide dinitrate (dilatrate-SR) [^111kzouw]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

General

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of isosorbide dinitrate. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by isosorbide dinitrate may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

As tolerance to isosorbide dinitrate develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted.

Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the interdosing intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of controlled-release oral isosorbide dinitrate is not known.

In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence.

Information for patients

Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate is strongly related to its dosing regimen, so the prescribed schedule of dosing should be followed carefully. In particular, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with isosorbide dinitrate. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with isosorbide dinitrate, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve isosorbide dinitrate-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on isosorbide dinitrate's antianginal efficacy.

Treatment with isosorbide dinitrate may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.

Drug interactions

The vasodilating effects of isosorbide dinitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with concomitant angina pectoris — patients who have both angina pectoris and HF should be given drugs that relieve angina along with drugs that are appropriate in the management of HF; both nitrates and beta-blockers can improve anginal symptoms and may produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and thus, they are preferred if these conditions coexist, and the decrease in ventricular volume and pressures produced by diuretics may exert independent antianginal effects. Because short-and long-term treatment with these drugs has increased the risk of worsening HF and death in patients with LV dysfunction, most calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with HF, and of available agents, only amlodipine has been shown not to adversely affect survival. In patients with both HF and angina pectoris, strong consideration should be given to the use of coronary revascularization, and coronary artery bypass surgery has been shown to lessen angina and reduce the risk of death in patients who have multivessel disease, reduced LVEF, and stable angina.

### The role of nitroglycerin and other nitrogen oxides in cardiovascular therapeutics [^114gffG5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of angina pectoris began not long after its original synthesis in 1847. Since then, the discovery of nitric oxide as a biological effector and better understanding of its roles in vasodilation, cell permeability, platelet function, inflammation, and other vascular processes have advanced our knowledge of the hemodynamic (mostly mediated through vasodilation of capacitance and conductance arteries) and nonhemodynamic effects of organic nitrate therapy, via both nitric oxide-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Nitrates are rapidly absorbed from mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin; thus, nitroglycerin is available in a number of preparations for delivery via several routes: oral tablets, sublingual tablets, buccal tablets, sublingual spray, transdermal ointment, and transdermal patch, as well as intravenous formulations. Organic nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but clinical data limit their use mostly to the treatment of angina. They are also used in the treatment of subsets of patients with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. One major limitation of the use of nitrates is the development of tolerance. Although several agents have been studied for use in the prevention of nitrate tolerance, none are currently recommended owing to a paucity of supportive clinical data. Only 1 method of preventing nitrate tolerance remains widely accepted: the use of a dosing strategy that provides an interval of no or low nitrate exposure during each 24-h period. Nitric oxide's important role in several cardiovascular disease mechanisms continues to drive research toward finding novel ways to affect both endogenous and exogenous sources of this key molecular mediator.

### How to diagnose and manage patients With fluoropyrimidine-induced chest pain: a single center approach [^115Y9EYw]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetics for oral twice daily capecitabine are similar to continuous infusion 5-FU. Oncologists typically treat 2 weeks on and 1 week off (a cycle). We have modified the previous steps for capecitabine (Figure 2). During days 2 to 14 of the cycle, we repeat the pre-treatment nifedipine and isosorbide mononitrate dosing in the morning. We also use 90 mg of extended-release diltiazem in the evening, 12 h after the first dose. All patients have nitroglycerin and are instructed on its use. Patients monitor their blood pressure daily and call us each morning before taking any medication. In the absence of symptoms, capecitabine is continued, and because metabolites accumulate over the 2 weeks, nifedipine and isosorbide mononitrate doses are up-titrated according to systolic blood pressure to maintain a systolic blood pressure of > 100 mm Hg. On day 15 after cycle completion, we re-dose nifedipine at the day 14 dose as monotherapy for all patients, and only continue subsequent dosing for patients with hypertension. We repeat this regimen with each cycle (Figure 2).

In our experience, we have not encountered any patient with limiting pre-treatment blood pressure. However, low blood pressure (systolic < 100 mm Hg) may limit the ability to up-titrate antispasm medication on days 2 to 14 of the capecitabine cycle. Baseline hypotension and/or inability to tolerate the 3-drug regimen precludes outpatient rechallenge. An alternative strategy, if there is no other chemotherapy choice, is inpatient FLOX with intravenous nitroglycerin and monitoring.

At our center, patients routinely receive cardiac toxicity symptom education before treatment, with reinforcement with every cycle. Every patient has a baseline ECG. Patients are instructed to stop therapy and to call with any chest discomfort. If they call with active symptoms, they go to the emergency department for formal evaluation. If they call after cessation of symptoms, chemotherapy is temporarily interrupted, and they proceed with prompt outpatient cardio-oncology evaluation. Before treatment, patients who may be at presumed higher risk (e.g. known CAD) are routinely referred to cardio-oncology for medication optimization.

### Prognosis of undiagnosed chest pain: linked electronic health record cohort study [^117XCYzs]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Setting

The study was set in the CALIBER (cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic health records) research programme. CALIBER links primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to the national registry of acute coronary syndromes (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, MINAP), inpatient diagnoses and procedures from Hospital Episode Statistics, and cause specific mortality from the Office for National Statistics. The CPRD is representative of the UK population in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and overall mortality. We have previously demonstrated the validity of CALIBER data for a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors across a variety of incident cardiovascular events. A description of the CALIBER approach and phenotyping algorithms combining Read, ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision), and drug and procedure codes to define risk factors and endpoints are available at.

Study population

The study population was all patients in the database aged 18 or over with a first (incident) coded record of chest pain (denoted as chest pain with cause unattributed, chest pain attributed to non-coronary cause, or angina) in primary or secondary care between 2002 and 2009. We excluded those with a record of angina or cardiovascular disease before their first recorded presentation of chest pain in that period or with less than two years of up-to-standard quality data in the CPRD at the time of their first chest pain event. The first record of chest pain was defined as the index presentation.

Definitions of chest pain at index presentation

We identified Read and ICD-10 symptom codes (available from) through consensus work to define unattributed chest pain (for example, codes for "chest pain not otherwise specified" or "tight chest pain" without clearly specifying a cause of the pain) and non-coronary chest pain (specific attribution to organ systems other than cardiovascular, such as "chest pain oesophagitis"). Read codes record morbidity in UK primary care; ICD10 codes record morbidity in secondary care. Angina was defined by Read or ICD-10 codes for angina or at least two prescriptions for nitrates.

### Tadalafil (Cialis) [^1157LRSk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular

Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention.

Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients:

myocardial infarction within the last 90 days
unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse
New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months
uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension
stroke within the last 6 months.

As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors.

### Trimetazidine for stable angina [^117RCf1T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with stable angina not controlled by monotherapy with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers are often treated with combinations of these drugs. There may be adverse effects from, or contraindications to, the use of combinations. In low risk groups, medical treatment appears to be as good an option as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in terms of averting myocardial infarction, death, or subsequent revascularization. Revascularization procedures are too costly or inaccessible for many patients in developing countries therefore effective and safe medical treatment is needed. Trimetazidine is a less well known anti-anginal drug that controls myocardial ischaemia through intracellular metabolic changes. Trimetazidine has been reported, in some studies, to be better tolerated than combined anti-anginal therapy; however it is not considered in published guidelines.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of trimetazidine in patients with stable angina.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and SCISEARCH, without language restriction, from inception to October 2003. Experts in the field were contacted to locate unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised studies comparing trimetazidine with placebo, or other anti-angina drug in adults with stable angina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies (1378 patients) met the inclusion criteria. There was a paucity of information about mortality, cardiovascular events and quality of life. Trimetazidine, compared with placebo, reduced the number of weekly angina attacks (mean difference -1.44, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.79; P < 0.0001), reduced weekly nitroglycerin tablet consumption (95% CI -1.47 to -2.20, -0.73; P < 0.0001) and improved exercise time to 1 mm segment depression (P = 0.0002). Four small trials (263 patients) compared trimetazidine against other anti-anginal agents. One favoured trimetazidine over nitrates. Three tended to favour alternative regimens but with confidence intervals consistent with both major increases and decreases in frequency of angina episodes. In this subgroup, adverse events were considered in 5 trials (448 patients) and totals of 2 versus 12 drop outs due to adverse events were observed in the trimetazidine and alternative regimens respectively, but this was mostly driven by a single trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Trimetazidine is effective in the treatment of stable angina compared with placebo, alone or combined with conventional anti-anginal agents. Trimetazidine may result in fewer dropouts due to adverse events. Large, long term trials comparing trimetazidine with other anti-anginal drugs assessing clinically relevant important outcomes are required to establish its role in clinical management.

### Long-term cardiovascular risk and management of patients recorded in primary care with unattributed chest pain: an electronic health record study [^111yDuNd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Population

The study population was all patients aged 18 years or over with a first (incident) coded record of chest pain denoted as chest pain with cause unattributed, or chest pain attributed to a noncoronary cause, in primary care between 2002 and 2018. Those with a record of cardiovascular disease (as defined below) before their first recorded presentation of chest pain, or with < 2 years of registration at their general practice at the time of their first chest pain event, were excluded. Index date was defined as the date of the first record of chest pain.

Up to 2018, UK primary care used Read codes to electronically record morbidity and processes of care. Our definition of unattributed chest pain included symptom codes not clearly specifying a cause of the pain, such as chest pain not otherwise specified and chest tightness. Noncoronary chest pain included recorded codes with specific attribution to organ systems other than cardiovascular such as costochondritis. Read code lists were derived through consensus work in our previous study.

The first 6 months after index date was defined as the diagnostic window to allow time for investigations and diagnosis related to initial presentation to occur. We excluded those with a diagnosed cardiovascular disease in the first 6 months (diagnostic window) after index date and those with follow‐up time of < 6 months from index date. Patients with initially unattributed chest pain at index date who received a record of noncoronary chest pain within the first 6 months were reallocated to the noncoronary group.

We also defined as a comparator group, patients with newly recorded angina, defined through a Read code or at least 2 prescriptions for nitrates. Those with < 2 years prior registration or a recorded myocardial infarction in the first 6 months after index date were excluded.

Symptoms that should be reported include chest pain, shortness of breath, a rapid or irregular heart rate, dizziness, insomnia after sexual activity, or fatigue the day after sexual activity; if chest pain tends to occur with sexual activity, nitroglycerine, if prescribed, can be taken just before or during sex, and patients or partners who use supplemental oxygen should also use it during sexual activity.

### Re-thinking angina [^112P42g1]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

William Heberden in 1772 published "some account of the disorder of the breast" which contains the essential elements of angina pectoris as we understand it today. The number of existing cases in the U.S. population today is 6.4 million. Myocardial ischemia manifested by angina pectoris can be either acute or chronic. Patients with chronic stable angina will be the focus of this supplement. The majority of patients are symptomatic but approximately 25% can be asymptomatic. The clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia generally are chest discomfort, arrhythmias, and LV dysfunction. Myocardial ischemia is a result of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand. High grade coronary stenosis are the usual cause of decreased oxygen supply. The classic hemodynamic factors increasing myocardial oxygen demand include hypertension and increased heart rate due to tachyarrhythmias of any etiology. Exertion is the usual precipitating cause of chronic myocardial ischemia. New information has come forward indicating that myocardial ischemia is associated with disruption of cellular sodium and calcium homeostasis. Ischemia results in a rise of intracellular sodium concentration and thus sodium overload which then activates the sodium calcium exchanger and leads to increased intracellular calcium. When this occurs there is electrical instability and mechanical dysfunction which increases oxygen demand and decreases oxygen supply. The compound Ranolazine is thought to selectively inhibit the late sodium current and attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarization and contractility associated with myocardial ischemia. This compound is the first new class of anti-anginal medication approved in 25 years which may provide physicians with additional therapy for chronic stable angina along with the other anti-angina agents, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates.

### Treatment of refractory angina in patients not suitable for revascularization [^114HMdGw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients, particularly those with advanced, chronic coronary artery disease, experience symptoms of angina that are refractory to treatment with β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates, despite revascularization. The management of patients with refractory angina who are unsuitable for further revascularization is strikingly different across the world, and is contingent on local resources and available expertise. Mortality in this patient population has decreased, but enhancing quality of life remains a challenge. New treatment principles are emerging in current practice, such as metabolic modulation, therapeutic angiogenesis, and novel interventional techniques (coronary in-flow redistribution and approaches to chronic total occlusion). The contemporary management of refractory angina encourages individualized, patient-centred care in interdisciplinary, specialized clinics. Global initiatives are required to address complex clinical problem-solving for patients with refractory angina. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of refractory angina, and provide an update on the pharmacological, noninvasive, and interventional options that are available to these patients or are under development.

### Active CAD and chest pain relief with nitroglycerin… [^116rg1hM]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason for hospital admission. In most patients with chest pain, acute coronary artery disease is the major concern. Nitrates often are used in emergency treatment of acute chest pain, but relief with nitrates is an uncertain diagnostic and prognostic sign. Because nitro-glycerin can relieve symptoms of noncardiac chest pain, including esophageal spasm, its value as a tool in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease is questionable. Henrikson and associates conducted a prospective study to determine the usefulness of chest pain response to nitroglycerin as an indicator of ischemic coronary disease. Patients who had documented chest pain while under medical supervision were given nitroglycerin. A chest pain response to the first dose of nitroglycerin was defined as a 50 percent or greater decrease in pain intensity within five minutes of nitroglycerin administration. The presence of active CAD was determined for all participants.

Active CAD was defined as elevated troponin levels, abnormal angiography, a positive stress test, or diagnosis at the time of hospital admission that was confirmed by a study cardiologist. Follow-up telephone calls were made to all participants approximately four months after hospitalization to determine clinical status. Of the total study sample of 459 patients, 181 patients had relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin. In patients with chest pain that likely was caused by active CAD, 35 percent had pain relief with nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin also reduced chest pain in 41 percent of the patients without active CAD. Both sensitivity and specificity of chest pain relief by nitroglycerin as a predictor of active CAD were low in the study group as a whole and in the subgroups. Chest pain relief also did not predict outcomes. The authors conclude that in an emergency setting, chest pain relief with nitro-glycerin lacks diagnostic or prognostic value for acute CAD.

These findings possibly could be applied to most outpatient settings. In an editorial in the same journal, Gibbons questions the external validity of the findings by noting that response to nitroglycerin has different physiologies in patients with acute chest pain and in those with chronic stable angina who have myocardial ischemia. He points out that the evidence supporting the predictive value of response to nitroglycerin in the chronic setting is strong. Gibbons concludes that the study findings may be legitimate in the acute setting, but that nitrate responsiveness is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients with chronic stable chest pain.

### Nitroglycerin response is not a predictor of ischemic etiology… [^115J6QA4]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin has been reported by cardiovascular textbooks as an important diagnostic clue in supporting a myocardial ischemia etiology. Shry and associates used a retrospective record review to evaluate the diagnostic value of responses to nitroglycerin administration in the emergency department. Patients presenting to the emergency department with ongoing chest pain who were treated with sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin for 10 minutes and whose response and follow-up data were available were included in the study. Chest pain of cardiac etiology was documented when any of the following criteria were noted: dynamic or new electrocardiographic changes, myocardial necrosis confirmed by elevated cardiac-specific enzyme elevations, abnormal stress test, significantly abnormal cardiac catheterization, and diagnosis of cardiac etiology by a staff cardiologist without meeting any of the prior criteria.

Patient chest pain before and after nitroglycerin administration was documented using a numeric pain scale of 1 to 10, with zero representing no pain and 10 denoting maximal pain. Response to nitroglycerin was defined as a decrease in pain by at least two numbers on the scale, and complete pain resolution was defined as the absence of chest pain. Pain response occurring more than 10 minutes after nitroglycerin administration was excluded because previous studies have demonstrated nitroglycerin's rapid clinical effect. Of the 223 patients included in the study, 67 percent were identified as having noncardiac chest pain and 33 percent had a cardiac etiology for myocardial ischemia. Ninety percent of the patients responded to nitroglycerin with an 88 percent response rate among those who were identified as having a cardiac etiology and a 92 percent response rate among those identified as not having a cardiac etiology.

If complete chest pain resolution was used as the end point, response to nitroglycerin was again high and not significantly different between the two groups. The authors conclude that patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain often have partial or complete relief of pain shortly after sublingual nitroglycerin administration, regardless of the etiology of chest pain. Pain relief may be the effect of nitroglycerin on smooth muscle relaxation resulting in improvement in pain of esophageal origin, and a significant placebo effect also may be occurring in this setting. A patient's response to nitroglycerin should not be used to support or exclude the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia.
