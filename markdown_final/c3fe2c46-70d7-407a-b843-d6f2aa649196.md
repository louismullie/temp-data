## Question

What is the appropriate antibiotic for treating an abscess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is appropriate for treating an abscess, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about source control and whether incision and drainage has been performed. Then, I should classify the abscess as simple versus complex and screen for systemic features or host risk factors. Next, I will weigh the evidence for adjuvant antibiotics after drainage, including absolute benefits and harms. After that, I should select empiric agents with MRSA coverage when indicated and consider alternatives if contraindicated. Finally, I will determine duration, address special populations, and outline follow-up and stewardship considerations, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and pivotal trials [^114nXAy1] [^113gWrmr] [^117E864F] [^113UkXua].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: incision and drainage is the primary therapy for cutaneous abscesses, and antibiotics alone are insufficient without adequate source control; I need to ensure that drainage has been performed or is planned before discussing antibiotics, because failure to drain is a common reason for treatment failure and persistent infection [^114AQV9v] [^1153sh1M] [^113UkXua].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify the infection phenotype and assess severity next. Simple abscesses are typically well-circumscribed, superficial, and without extension into deeper tissues or multiloculation, whereas complex abscesses involve deeper structures, significant surrounding cellulitis, or are located in high-risk anatomical sites such as perianal or perirectal regions; I also need to check for systemic inflammatory response or immunocompromise, as these shift the balance toward antibiotics in addition to drainage [^112999qw] [^113xx2J3] [^111tWNDR].

> I will now examine whether antibiotics are indicated after drainage. For uncomplicated, simple abscesses, guidelines diverge: IDSA 2014 concluded that routine antibiotics after I&D did not improve cure rates, whereas the BMJ 2018 Rapid Recommendation, informed by newer randomized trials, issued a weak recommendation for offering TMP-SMX or clindamycin after I&D due to modest reductions in treatment failure and recurrence; I should double-check that this weak recommendation reflects closely balanced benefits and harms and the need for shared decision-making [^113UkXua] [^114nXAy1] [^111VtADd].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit from the pivotal trials before I counsel the patient. In NEJM 2017, clindamycin and TMP-SMX each improved short-term cure versus placebo after I&D, with absolute risk reductions around 12–14% and reductions in new infections; similarly, NEJM 2016 showed TMP-SMX outperformed placebo with an absolute cure difference of about 7% and fewer subsequent procedures and new lesions; a 2019 meta-analysis corroborated an approximately 7% absolute reduction in treatment failure with antibiotics after I&D, though with a small increase in minor adverse events, so I should frame this as a modest but real benefit balanced against side effects [^113gWrmr] [^117E864F] [^116adFKJ].

> Next, I should review absolute benefits and harms to guide shared decision-making. Compared with no antibiotics, TMP-SMX or clindamycin after I&D reduces treatment failure by about 5% at one month and recurrence by about 8% at three months, with an overall composite reduction of roughly 13%; TMP-SMX tends to cause less diarrhea than clindamycin, while clindamycin may modestly reduce early recurrence in one trial, though this is uncertain and not consistently reproduced; cephalosporins, in contrast, likely do not improve outcomes over I&D alone in settings with substantial MRSA prevalence, so I should avoid them as adjuvant therapy here [^1118Xies] [^115FF4Ke] [^1133GnqU].

> Let me think about empiric antibiotic selection when antibiotics are chosen. Given the high prevalence of MRSA in purulent SSTIs, TMP-SMX or clindamycin are preferred first-line oral agents after I&D; TMP-SMX is generally less expensive and has a lower risk of diarrhea, while clindamycin may be favored if recurrence prevention is prioritized and local resistance permits; I should confirm local clindamycin inducible resistance patterns before selecting it, and I must avoid cephalosporins because they lack reliable MRSA activity and have not shown added benefit in this context [^114nXAy1] [^116zAVhn] [^115FF4Ke].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take TMP-SMX or clindamycin. Doxycycline is a reasonable alternative for MRSA coverage in adults, though I need to remember its limited activity against beta-hemolytic streptococci; if streptococcal coverage is needed, I should pair doxycycline with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin or cephalexin, or use clindamycin monotherapy if local susceptibility supports it; in severe disease or when oral therapy is not feasible, IV options like vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline can be used, tailoring to severity, comorbidities, and local resistance [^112z7Dvu] [^117MdSXz] [^1125JJvB].

> I should confirm duration next. Standard outpatient courses in the RCTs ranged from 7 to 10 days, and a weak recommendation supports 5–10 days with extension if response is slow; newer data suggest that extending beyond 7–10 days rarely adds benefit and may increase adverse effects, so I should individualize to clinical response and avoid routine prolonged therapy beyond 10 days in uncomplicated cases [^114nXAy1] [^117BeCBh] [^112FyTjX].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I need to avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester due to teratogenic risk and consider beta-lactams with caution, balancing risks; in pediatrics, evidence is mixed, with a pediatric RCT suggesting no clear superiority of TMP-SMX over placebo for short-term cure after I&D, though newer adult-pediatric trials show benefit, so shared decision-making remains key; for recurrent abscesses, I should obtain cultures, treat identified pathogens for 5–10 days, and consider decolonization strategies; for immunocompromised hosts or those with systemic signs, I should not withhold antibiotics and should broaden coverage as indicated by the clinical picture [^111Tviut] [^1126Woy3] [^113gWrmr] [^111LRskt] [^116CGGQm] [^111tWNDR].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and stewardship steps. If antibiotics are prescribed, I should arrange reassessment within 48–72 hours to confirm clinical improvement; if the patient is not improving, I should reconsider the adequacy of source control, obtain cultures if not already done, and reassess for resistant organisms or alternative diagnoses; routine cultures are not required for uncomplicated abscesses, but they are reasonable in recurrent disease, severe infection, immunocompromise, or outbreaks; I should also counsel on wound care and pain control, recognizing that routine packing increases pain without clear benefit and that simple dressings are usually sufficient [^114CSRxj] [^116CGGQm] [^113UkXua] [^111uGL8f].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cephalosporins might be acceptable as adjuvant therapy because they are commonly used for SSTIs; let me reconsider that in light of the MRSA epidemiology and the network meta-analysis showing no added benefit of cephalosporins over I&D alone and likely inferiority to TMP-SMX or clindamycin in MRSA-prevalent settings, so I should correct that inclination and avoid cephalosporins as adjuvant therapy for uncomplicated abscesses after I&D [^115FF4Ke] [^1133GnqU].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: for a drained, uncomplicated cutaneous abscess, engage in shared decision-making about adjuvant antibiotics; if chosen, prescribe TMP-SMX or clindamycin for 7–10 days, favoring TMP-SMX when tolerability and cost are priorities, and avoid cephalosporins; reserve broader or IV therapy for complex infections, systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of initial management, and always prioritize timely incision and drainage as the cornerstone of therapy [^114nXAy1] [^113gWrmr] [^117E864F] [^113UkXua].

---

For uncomplicated skin abscesses, **incision and drainage is the primary therapy** [^114AQV9v]; antibiotics are not routinely required [^113UkXua]. Use **TMP-SMX or clindamycin** [^114nXAy1] if MRSA risk is high or if there is significant cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic symptoms [^111tWNDR]. For complex or deep abscesses, use **broad-spectrum IV therapy** (e.g. vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam) [^112999qw] and tailor to culture results [^116UZ3J7]. Routine cultures are not needed for simple abscesses [^114CSRxj]; obtain cultures for recurrent, complex, or severe cases [^116CGGQm] [^117Vr2nK] [^114CSRxj]. Duration is typically 5–10 days, individualized to response [^111Tviut] [^117BeCBh].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated skin abscesses after adequate incision and drainage [^113UkXua]. Indications for antibiotic therapy include:

- **MRSA risk**: High local prevalence or patient-specific risk factors [^notfound].
- **Significant cellulitis**: Extensive surrounding erythema or induration [^112999qw].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Including diabetes, HIV, or immunosuppressive therapy [^112999qw].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, tachycardia, or elevated white blood cell count [^111tWNDR].
- **Recurrent abscesses**: Multiple or recurrent infections [^116CGGQm].

---

## Empiric antibiotic recommendations

Empiric antibiotic selection should **cover MRSA**, the most common pathogen in skin abscesses [^114BT1Uk]. Recommended oral agents for uncomplicated abscesses with MRSA risk include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily | - First-line agent <br/> - Monitor for hypersensitivity and renal function [^114nXAy1] |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally four times daily | - Alternative agent <br/> - Monitor for C. difficile infection [^115FF4Ke] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | - Alternative agent <br/> - Limited streptococcal coverage [^112z7Dvu] |

---

For **complex or deep abscesses**, use **broad-spectrum IV therapy** initially, such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam, then tailor to culture results [^112999qw] [^116UZ3J7].

---

## Role of incision and drainage

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the **cornerstone of abscess management** [^114AQV9v] and is superior to antibiotics alone. Antibiotics alone are insufficient without adequate drainage [^111pS5Gp]. I&D should be performed for all abscesses, with technique tailored to size and location [^115egG64].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy should be **individualized** based on clinical response, severity, and presence of systemic symptoms. Typical durations include:

- **Uncomplicated abscesses**: 5–7 days [^11715JoP].
- **Complicated abscesses or systemic symptoms**: 7–14 days [^116UZ3J7].
- **Recurrent abscesses**: 5–10 days, with evaluation for underlying causes [^116CGGQm].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Adjunctive antibiotic therapy after I&D modestly reduces treatment failure and recurrence rates. TMP-SMX or clindamycin reduce recurrence by approximately 8% compared with I&D alone [^1118Xies]. However, antibiotics are associated with **increased adverse effects**, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms [^115FF4Ke].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Antibiotics are generally not required after adequate I&D unless MRSA risk or systemic symptoms are present [^1126Woy3].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broader antibiotic coverage and longer duration may be necessary [^112999qw].
- **Recurrent abscesses**: Evaluate for underlying causes (e.g. hidradenitis suppurativa, pilonidal cyst) and consider decolonization strategies [^116CGGQm].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **I&D as primary therapy**, with antibiotics reserved for specific indications [^111eVYNk]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommend antibiotics for patients with MRSA risk, significant cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic symptoms [^111tWNDR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Incision and drainage remains the **primary treatment** for skin abscesses [^114AQV9v]. Antibiotics are adjunctive and should be used selectively based on MRSA risk, cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic symptoms. TMP-SMX or clindamycin are first-line agents for MRSA coverage, with broader therapy for complex cases [^112999qw].

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favour of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone. For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. Box 1 shows the articles and evidence linked to this Rapid Recommendation. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format. The panel emphasises shared decision making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced: clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients. Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of this article.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^111VtADd]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initial empiric therapy, BMJ 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering TMP/SMX or clindamycin along with incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone in patients with an uncomplicated skin abscess. Discuss both options with each patient.

---

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^1133GnqU]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The panel is confident that the evidence applies to almost all patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses treated with incision and drainage: adults and children, patients presenting to emergency departments and to primary care practices, smaller and larger abscesses, first abscess occurrences and recurrences, and abscesses with unknown infection pathogens. The systematic review and meta-analyses contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent between pre-specified subgroups.

Values and preferences

The panel believes that there is a high degree of variability between patients and carers weighing the expected desirable and undesirable consequences of antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy. This variation is reflected in the weak recommendation, which warrants shared decision making to ensure that each individual's decision is in line with what they consider most important. The expected benefit of antibiotic therapy in reducing pain, risk of treatment failure, and recurrence is modest, but large enough that the panel anticipates that most fully informed patients would value these benefits sufficiently to choose antibiotic treatment. This might particularly be the case when, for example, the abscess is very painful, perhaps because of location in sensitive places (such as groin, axillae, etc).

For patients who decide to initiate antibiotic treatment, reasonable choices include either TMP-SMX or clindamycin. In some settings, cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses. Given that, in most circumstances, cephalosporins probably do not provide any additional benefit beyond incision and drainage alone, the panel felt that all or almost all patients would choose to use antibiotic options with proven efficacy (TMP-SMX or clindamycin), hence the strong recommendation against cephalosporins.

People who place a higher value on the possibility of avoiding abscess recurrence may choose clindamycin, while those who place a higher value on avoiding diarrhoea and on minimising costs are likely to prefer TMP-SMX.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Fig 1
Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. (MRSA = meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSSA = meticillin susceptible S aureus)

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Systemic antibiotics after incision and drainage of simple abscesses: a meta-analysis [^116tsbtR]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of cutaneous abscesses. While there is general agreement that abscesses should be treated with incision and drainage, it is unclear whether systemic antibiotics should be routinely prescribed.

Objective

To evaluate whether systemic antibiotics, when compared with a placebo, improve cure rates in patients with simple abscesses after incision and drainage.

Methods Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis using RevMan5.

Patients and Settings

Children and adults with simple abscesses treated in outpatient clinics or emergency departments.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase and bibliographies.

Outcome Measures

Percentage of patients with complete resolution of abscess without the need for recurrent incision and drainage, additional antibiotics, or hospital admission within 7–10days of treatment.

Results

We included four trials, consisting of 589 patients in total (428 adults and 161 children). Patients were randomised to one of three antibiotics (cephridine (27), cephalexin (82), or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (161)) or to placebo (285), with 34 lost to follow-up or having incomplete data. When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics did not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses 7–10days after treatment (88.1% vs 86.0%; OR 1.17 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.95)).

Conclusions

When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics do not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses.

Education into practice

Do you currently consider antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses after surgical treatment?
What information could you share with your patient to help reach a decision together?
Would you consider using online decision aid tools (such as the one available on MAGICapp) to facilitate shared decision making?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Three people with lived experience of skin abscesses were full panel members: two had previously experienced skin abscesses before (one with recurrent abscesses), and one person is a parent of a child who experienced a skin abscess. These panel members identified patient-important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and preferences. These patient partners agreed that, although pain reduction was the most important outcome to them, these values may not be shared by all patients. The close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences made it difficult for them (and the panel) to decide which options most individuals would choose.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

Regarding specific circumstances for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to patients with complex abscesses, SIS-E/WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to administer empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria) in the presence of systemic signs of infection, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete, or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^113gWrmr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P = 0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P = 0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P = 0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

What you need to know

For uncomplicated skin abscesses, we suggest using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone, and emphasise the need for shared decision making
TMP-SMX or clindamycin modestly reduces pain and treatment failure and probably reduces abscess recurrence, but increases the risk of adverse effects including nausea and diarrhoea
We suggest TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin because TMP-SMX has a lower risk of diarrhoea
Cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage are probably not more effective than incision and drainage alone in most settings
From a societal perspective, the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics may not outweigh the harms from increased antimicrobial resistance in the community, although this is speculative

### Irrigation of cutaneous abscesses does not improve treatment success [^113hAoSb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Irrigation of the cutaneous abscess cavity is often described as a standard part of incision and drainage despite no randomized, controlled studies showing benefit. Our goal is to determine whether irrigation of a cutaneous abscess during incision and drainage in the emergency department (ED) decreases the need for further intervention within 30 days compared with no irrigation.

Methods

We performed a single-center, prospective, randomized, nonblinded study of ED patients receiving an incision and drainage for cutaneous abscess, randomized to irrigation or no irrigation. Patient characteristics and postprocedure pain visual analog scale score were obtained. Thirty-day telephone follow-up was conducted with a standardized data form examining need for further intervention, which was defined as repeated incision and drainage, antibiotic change, or abscess-related hospital admission.

Results

Of 209 enrolled patients, 187 completed follow-up. The irrigation and no-irrigation groups were similar with respect to diabetes, immunocompromise, fever, abscess size, cellulitis, and abscess location, but the irrigation group was younger (mean age 36 versus 40 years) and more often treated with packing (89% versus 75%) and outpatient antibiotics (91% versus 73%). The need for further intervention was not different in the irrigation (15%) and no-irrigation (13%) groups (difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -8% to 12%). There was no difference in pain visual analog scale scores (5.6 versus 5.7; difference 0.1; 95% confidence interval -0.7 to 0.9).

Conclusion

Although there were baseline differences between groups, irrigation of the abscess cavity during incision and drainage did not decrease the need for further intervention.

### Systemic antibiotics for the treatment of Skin and Soft tissue abscesses: a Systematic Review and meta-analysis [^116adFKJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The addition of antibiotics to standard incision and drainage is controversial, with earlier studies demonstrating no significant benefit. However, 2 large, multicenter trials have recently been published that have challenged the previous literature. The goal of this review was to determine whether systemic antibiotics for abscesses after incision and drainage improve cure rates.

Methods

PubMed, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of selected articles were assessed for all randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant antibiotics with placebo in the treatment of drained abscesses, with an outcome of treatment failure assessed within 21 days. Data were dual extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Results

Four studies (n = 2,406 participants) were identified. There were 89 treatment failures (7.7%) in the antibiotic group and 150 (16.1%) in the placebo group. The calculated risk difference was 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8% to 12.1%), with an odds ratio for clinical cure of 2.32 (95% CI 1.75 to 3.08) in favor of the antibiotic group. There was also a decreased incidence of new lesions in the antibiotic group (risk difference -10.0%, 95% CI -12.8% to -7.2%; odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44), with a minimally increased risk of minor adverse events (risk difference 4.4%, 95% CI 1.0% to 7.8%; odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58).

Conclusion

The use of systemic antibiotics for skin and soft tissue abscesses after incision and drainage resulted in an increased rate of clinical cure. Providers should consider the use of antibiotics while balancing the risk of adverse events.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^115NkCAT]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current understanding

A skin abscess is an isolated collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are collections of pus within the skin structures and are usually caused by bacterial infections. Careful history and clinical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose a skin abscess. Skin abscesses present as single or multiple tender, erythematous, indurated nodules, often surrounded by an area of erythema or swelling. Fluctuance beneath the skin often indicates a fluid filled cavity. There may be a pustule at the area where the abscess is closest to the skin or spontaneous drainage of pus. The use of point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate an abscess from other soft tissue infections in the emergency department.

Skin infections are common. More than 4% of people seek treatment for skin infections annually in the United States. In European countries, it may be less common: in Belgium and the Netherlands about 0.5–0.6% visit their general practitioner with bacterial skin infections each year.

Recurrent skin abscesses — appropriate treatment includes the following recommendations: A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). Culture recurrent abscess and treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^1118Xies]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

Absolute benefits and harms

The infographic provides an overview of the recommendations and the absolute benefits and harms of different antibiotics. Estimates of the baseline risk for side effects are derived from the control groups of the trials in the systematic review. Detailed information can also be viewed through MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision making with patients.

This clinical practice guideline is applicable to patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses, which means that it is not applicable to patients with evidence of systemic illness (such as sepsis), deep tissue infections, superficial infections (such as pustules and papules), hidradenitis suppurativa, or immunocompromising conditions, and patients who do not undergo incision and drainage.

The first recommendation relates to the usefulness of adjuvant TMP-SMX or clindamycin compared with no antibiotics in addition to incision and drainage. The effects of other antibiotics are speculative, except for cephalosporins, which are probably less effective or not effective (see evidence summary for recommendation No 2). Compared with no antibiotics, TMP-SMX or clindamycin reduces the absolute risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month (high quality evidence). In patients who were cured, these antibiotics reduced the absolute risk of recurrence at three months by approximately 8% (high quality evidence). When considering both treatment failure and abscess recurrence, antibiotic therapy thus provides an approximate 13% reduction (high quality evidence). TMP-SMX or clindamycin probably provides a modest reduction in pain (tenderness) during treatment (7% fewer), and a small reduction in hospitalisation (2% fewer) and in similar infections among household contacts (2% fewer) (all moderate quality evidence). Considering the characteristics of involved patients and medical conditions may differ between emergency departments and general practices, antibiotics may confer an even smaller benefit in patients who present to their GP. Antibiotics probably do not reduce the risk of serious or invasive infections or death (moderate quality evidence).

### Effectiveness of outpatient antibiotics after surgical drainage of abscesses in reducing treatment failure [^111ov3Q3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to outpatient antibiotic use after surgical drainage of abscesses is unclear given conflicting clinical trial results.

Objective

Our primary objective was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing after surgical drainage of cutaneous abscesses on reducing treatment failure.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study using data extracted from the electronic health record of a single academic health care system. All emergency department (ED) visits that resulted in discharge with a surgical drainage of a cutaneous abscess procedure code were included in the sample. All visits were categorized into having received or not having received an antibiotic prescription at the index visit. Outcome frequencies were compared using Pearson's chi-squared test. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of treatment failure among those who did and did not receive an antibiotic prescription at their index ED visit.

Results

The final sample consisted of 421 index ED visits, of which 303 (72%) received an antibiotic prescription. Treatment with antibiotics after drainage did not significantly reduce the odds of composite treatment failure within 30 days when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical encounter variables (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23–1.21).

Conclusions

This real-world, comparative effectiveness analysis did not demonstrate any significant reduction in treatment failure with the use of antibiotics after drainage of abscesses in the ED. It is unclear if the clinical benefit observed under controlled trial conditions will carry over to routine clinical practice where varied antibiotic regimens are the norm and local bacterial resistance patterns vary.

### News, views, and reviews. less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^113NfFz6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate for a particular individual.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

Results

The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.

Conclusions

In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00729937.).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113KrirW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic active against MRSA in patients with carbuncles or abscesses not responding to initial antibiotic treatment or having markedly impaired host defenses or systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with hypotension.

### How do you treat an abscess in the era of increased community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? [^111T2v86]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the era of increased prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there have been a number of questions and several recent studies that address the clinical management of uncomplicated abscesses in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

We examine the historical and clinical predictors for MRSA in patients with an uncomplicated abscess and review the evidence behind the use of wound cultures, decolonization, antibiotics, irrigation, and packing after incision and drainage. We found that current recommendations and treatment guidelines are often based on limited data, expert opinion, and anecdotal experience.

Conclusion

In light of the data currently available, antibiotics and decolonization should be used selectively, not routinely, for treatment of most uncomplicated abscesses. Wound cultures are generally not necessary in the ED, and all patients should be given return precautions for worsening symptoms.

### Optimal antibacterial treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: applying a novel treatment algorithm [^113EN1oM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Incision and drainage combined with antibiotic therapies form the backbone of managing uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). An algorithm has been developed to guide the treatment of uSSSIs in the primary care setting in situations where initial empiric therapy is appropriate. This includes instances when a culture is taken, but it is deemed appropriate to begin an antibiotic empirically pending the results of the culture. The panel that developed the algorithm was chaired by Dr. Richard Scher of Columbia University and included thought leaders in the fields of clinical dermatology, dermatologic surgery, infectious disease, pediatric infectious disease, podiatry, and HIV infection. The panel acknowledged that the initial choice of antibiotic is generally determined by tolerability, ease of administration, cost, and efficacy. The usual choices for initial empiric therapy include cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Currently marketed cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations lack activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) was a major consideration when designing the treatment algorithm. Many CA-MRSA skin infections present as abscess, and drainage is the most important component of therapy in this setting. When the history and physical exam suggest CA-MRSA infection, and there is no fluctuant collection of purulent material to be drained, a sulfa drug or tetracycline is generally the best choice for initial empiric therapy.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^1137MrAc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

### Management of cutaneous abscesses by dermatologists [^111FyT47]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

There is currently no data detailing the degree to which dermatologists follow CDC/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines in the treatment of abscesses, which recommend that incision and drainage (I+D) as primary therapy for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI).

Objective

To evaluate the management of skin abscesses by dermatologists.

Design, Setting, Participants

A national email survey of 780 dermatologists was conducted from May-June 2012. Awareness, experience, and preparedness of respondents for abscess treatment, as well as the treatment practices in different clinical scenarios were evaluated. Response rate = 65% (n = 510).

Eligibility Criteria

board certified/eligible dermatologists practicing in US. Main practice affiliation: solo (20%), group (33%), university health system/academic (32%), multi-specialty (13%), and other (2%). Main practice setting: urban (49%), suburban (42%), and rural (9%).

Main Outcome and Measures

Practitioner report of: awareness of national guidelines, use of I+D in initial management of uncomplicated abscess found on face, trunk, and extremity on patients age 6 months, 3, 15, 50, and 80 years, and use of antibiotics in the initial management.

Results

99% of respondents were capable of performing I+D in their practice. The IDSA recommends cultures in all patients treated with antibiotic therapy, and does not recommend antibiotics for the treatment of simple abscess. 18% of respondents reported culturing abscesses less than 50% of the time, while 91% incorporated antibiotics into initial treatment. Nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents would choose an initial antibiotic that would not cover Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For facial abscesses, as the age of the patient increased from infant, respondents were more likely to incorporate I+D into their initial treatment. For abscesses on the trunk and extremities, respondents were less likely to I+D infants and toddlers, compared to adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Conclusion

Although most dermatologists were prepared to manage uncomplicated abscesses (98%), this survey identifies gaps in clinical standards of care established by the CDC/IDSA. Identification of these practice gaps may impact physician practice and dermatology residency curricula, and may serve to improve abscess management and antibacterial stewardship in the outpatient setting.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Subgroup analysis of antibiotic treatment for skin Abscesses [^1127Vwkj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Two large randomized trials recently demonstrated efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotics for drained skin abscesses. We determine whether outcome advantages observed in one trial exist across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline-recommended antibiotic indications.

Methods

We conducted a planned subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial at 5 US emergency departments, demonstrating superiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (320/1,600 mg twice daily for 7 days) compared with placebo for patients older than 12 years with a drained skin abscess. We determined between-group differences in rates of clinical (no new antibiotics) and composite cure (no new antibiotics or drainage) through 7 to 14 and 42 to 56 days after treatment among subgroups with and without abscess cavity or erythema diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm, history of MRSA, fever, diabetes, and comorbidities. We also evaluated treatment effect by lesion size and culture result.

Results

Among 1,057 mostly adult participants, median abscess cavity and erythema diameters were 2.5 cm (range 0.1 to 16.0 cm) and 6.5 cm (range 1.0 to 38.5), respectively; 44.3% grew MRSA. Overall, for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and placebo groups, clinical cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 92.9% and 85.7%; composite cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 86.5% and 74.3%, and at 42 to 56 days, it was 82.4% and 70.2%. For all outcomes, across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline antibiotic criteria, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes. Treatment effect was greatest with history of MRSA infection, fever, and positive MRSA culture.

Conclusion

Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes regardless of lesion size or guideline antibiotic criteria.

### Importance of understanding pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic principles in the emergence of resistances, including community-associated Staphylococcus aureus [^116wvdF6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic parameters have been defined to predict efficacy in antimicrobial selection for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are the bases for describing the in vivo behavior of antimicrobial agents. T > MIC is the duration of time that a pathogen is exposed to concentrations of antimicrobial agents that exceed the MIC of that particular organism. For antimicrobials with time-dependent activity (eg, penicillin and cephalosporins), the T > MIC needed to eradicate bacteria is generally 40% to 50% of the dosing interval. The most frequently prescribed oral antimicrobials for uSSSI are oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, macrolides, anti-staphylococcal penicillins, and fluoroquinolones. The selected oral agent should display a broad spectrum of antimicrobial coverage, be able to be dosed once, or at most twice, a day, and show high levels of target attainment (≥ 90%) for eradicating the key pathogens associated with uSSSI. The recent emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community setting (CA-MRSA) is especially troublesome in that oral cephalosporins (and all other beta-lactam agents) are contraindicated, requiring alternative therapeutic approaches. While a common cause of cutaneous disease, including abscess formation, CA-MRSA has caused life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis and pneumonia. Treatment of abscesses produced by this pathogen consists of incision and drainage followed by an appropriate oral antimicrobial, based upon knowledge on the local resistance prevalence rates or as directed by culture and susceptibility testing.

### Primary closure of cutaneous abscesses: a systematic review [^114h9W5x]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous abscesses have traditionally been treated with incision and drainage followed by secondary healing. Primary closure after incision and drainage is an alternative mode of therapy practiced in some parts of the world. The current study reviews the experience with primary closure of abscesses.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using search terms abscess and primary closure. The databases searched included MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Library between 1950 and 2009. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also manually searched for additional studies. We performed a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials in which patients were randomized to either primary or secondary closure of incised and drained abscesses using Review Manager software.

Results

Of 33 articles retrieved, there were 7 randomized controlled trials in which 915 patients were randomized to primary (n = 455) or secondary (n = 460) closure. Many abscesses were located in the anogenital region and drained by surgeons. The time to healing after primary closure (7.8 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.3–8.3]) was significantly shorter than that after secondary closure (15.0 days [95% CI, 14.3–15.7]; absolute difference, 7.3 days [95% CI, 6.9–7.6]). The rates of abscess recurrence after primary closure (7.6% [95% CI, 4.6–10.6]) were similar to those after secondary closure (11.1 days [95% CI, 7.5–14.7]; odds ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35–1.15]).

Conclusions

Studies from 4 countries suggest that primary closure of incised and drained abscesses results in faster healing and similar low abscess recurrence rates than after secondary closure. These studies provide a foundation for which clinical trials can be conducted in the United States.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1149CyRV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### When antibiotics are unnecessary [^115dAu6J]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Dermatologists can decrease unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents by avoiding them in situations wherein good evidence indicates that they are ineffective. Controlled trials indicate that antimicrobial agents are unhelpful in treating cutaneous abscesses, inflamed epidermal cysts, uninfected atopic eczema, and cutaneous ulcers caused by venous insufficiency or diabetes in the absence of significant contiguous soft-tissue inflammation. Prophylactic antibiotics are rarely appropriate for routine dermatologic surgery and are not indicated for patients who have prosthetic joints or vascular grafts. They are recommended only for a small group of patients who have abnormal cardiac valves, and then only with surgery involving clearly infected skin or soft-tissue. Topical antibiotics are no better than white petrolatum in covering sutured wounds, and with moist occlusive dressings, no ointment is necessary.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Determining the optimal antibiotic duration for skin and soft tissue infections [^112FyTjX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal duration of therapy in SSTIs - a heterogeneous group of infections - remains unknown. The advances in knowledge of antibiotic duration of treatment in selected SSTIs that can impact clinical practice and published in the last 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence indicates that few patients receive guideline concordant empiric antibiotics and appropriate duration in the United States, although this likely can be extrapolated to other countries. One of the most commonly identified opportunities to improve antibiotic stewardship is duration of therapy more than 10 days. The long-standing debate regarding the significance of abscess size and its impact on clinical response to antibiotics, following proper drainage, is increasingly shifting towards the conclusion that abscess size is not directly associated with cure. In obese patients with SSTI, there is no benefit to longer antibiotic durations for SSTIs in patients with obesity, and it appears that longer antibiotic duration of therapy was associated with increased treatment failure. In diabetic foot infections (DFO), two randomized studies suggest that in the presence of osteomyelitis, the total duration of antibiotic therapy for patients treated nonsurgically does not need to be more than 6weeks. In a prospective, randomized, noninferiority, pilot trial, patients with DFO who underwent surgical debridement and received either a 3-week or 6-week course of antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events. In patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, successive observational studies clearly suggest that short duration of antibiotic treatment after NSTI source control is as well tolerated and effective as a longer course. It appears that 48h would be enough. The possibility of fixed versus individualized approaches to therapy for common bacterial infections, including SSTIs merits to be considered seriously. Fully individualized therapy may be an ideal approach to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of antimicrobials. Much more work is needed before this strategy becomes feasible.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that shorter duration of treatment is better in different types of SSTIs. Paradoxically, evaluation of real-life clinical practice indicates that long treatments continue to be commonly given to this population.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department [^115joSCW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article covers the diagnosis and treatment of skin and soft tissue infections commonly encountered in the emergency department: impetigo, cutaneous abscesses, purulent cellulitis, nonpurulent cellulitis, and necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections. Most purulent infections in the United States are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. For abscesses, we emphasize the importance of incision and drainage. Nonpurulent infections are usually caused by streptococcal species and initial empiric antibiotics need not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. For uncommon but potentially lethal necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections, the challenge is rapid diagnosis in the emergency department and prompt surgical exploration and debridement.

### Antibiotic prescribing practices in a multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection [^1177NgQH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hospitalizations for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) are common. Optimizing antibiotic use for ABSSSIs requires an understanding of current management. The objective of this study was to evaluate antibiotic prescribing practices and factors affecting prescribing in a diverse group of hospitals.

Design

Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Seven community and academic hospitals.

Methods

Children and adults hospitalized between June 2010 and May 2012 for cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess were eligible. The primary endpoint was a composite of 2 prescribing practices representing potentially avoidable antibiotic exposure: (1) use of antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria or (2) treatment duration greater than 10 days.

Results

A total of 533 cases were included: 320 with nonpurulent cellulitis, 44 with wound infection or purulent cellulitis, and 169 with abscess. Of 492 cases with complete prescribing data, the primary endpoint occurred in 394 (80%) cases and varied significantly across hospitals (64%-97%; P < .001). By logistic regression, independent predictors of the primary endpoint included wound infection or purulent cellulitis (odds ratio [OR], 5.12 [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.46–17.88), head or neck involvement (OR, 2.83 [95% CI, 1.17–6.82]), adult cases (OR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.18–4.11]), and admission to a community hospital (OR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.05–3.44]).

Conclusions

Among patients hospitalized for ABSSSI, use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity or treatment courses longer than 10 days were common. There may be substantial opportunity to reduce antibiotic exposure through shorter courses of therapy targeting gram-positive bacteria.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^115FF4Ke]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The occurrence of adverse effects depends on the antibiotic. With clindamycin, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects (predominately diarrhoea) is approximately 10% higher than with no antibiotics (high quality evidence). TMP-SMX probably increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects by a smaller amount (approximately 2%; moderate quality evidence), and it is predominately nausea rather than diarrhoea. The severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was not described, but is likely to range from mild to severe. Two large trials monitored for Clostridium difficile infection with routine clinical monitoring and no such infection occurred in any treatment arm.

Overall, there is no important difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin (high quality evidence). In patients who were initially cured, one study suggested that clindamycin may reduce the risk of early recurrence at one month by approximately 7% (low quality evidence), but the confidence interval was wide and this result is inconsistent with indirect evidence from other RCTs, which suggests that the reduction in risk of abscess recurrence compared with placebo is similar for both TMP-SMX and clindamycin. Whether clindamycin reduces abscess recurrence more than TMP-SMX is therefore uncertain (low quality evidence). Local resistance patterns may affect the relative effectiveness of each antibiotic option. Clindamycin has a 10% higher risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea than TMP-SMX (high quality evidence).

The panel also considered evidence for cephalosporins compared with TMP-SMX and clindamycin used for uncomplicated skin abscesses. The network meta-analysis suggested that, at least in settings with a substantial prevalence of MRSA, cephalosporins in addition to incision and drainage probably do not reduce treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone (moderate quality evidence). Both early and later generation cephalosporins probably confer a higher risk of treatment failure compared with either TMP-SMX or clindamycin (moderate quality evidence). The RCTs investigating cephalosporins did not report sufficient information to directly compare other outcomes. However, the panel felt that cephalosporins were unlikely to provide any other benefits if they do not reduce the risk of treatment failure compared with placebo (low quality evidence). This evidence directly applies to almost all settings where the prevalence of MRSA is more than 10%.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### Methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: management principles and selection of antibiotic therapy [^112XFSfn]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^112pM8B3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

ABSSSIs pose a significant burden to the healthcare system. The challenge of treating these infections has been lessened by recent development of new antibiotic treatment options that target gram-positive organisms including MRSA strains. However, new antibiotics that can cover both gram-positive pathogens (including MRSA) and gram-negative pathogens can fulfill an important need in the treatment of selected hospitalized patients with acute skin infections. Examples of such infections include abscesses with mixed bacterial growth, surgical-site infections, particularly those related to abdominal surgery, and selected acute skin infections in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, antibiotics that can offer hospital clinicians other attributes, such as the flexibility to transition from IV to oral formulation, infrequent dosing, pharmacokinetics that are unaffected by various patient characteristics, a low risk of drug–drug interactions, and no requirement for therapeutic monitoring, will be particularly useful when treating ABSSSIs.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:

A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^111Tviut]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Person-centred versus societal perspective (impact on antibiotic resistance)

The recommendations explicitly take a person-centred perspective rather than a public health or societal perspective. The use of antibiotics is associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance within the community and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistant infections in community members. The increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance are a public health priority. From a societal perspective, it is possible that the modest benefits from adjuvant antibiotics in this scenario would not outweigh the risk of increased antimicrobial resistance in the community. However, the impact of an individual course of antibiotics on community resistance rates is unknown. Therefore, whether antibiotics in this situation provide a net benefit or harm to society is highly speculative. Clinicians engaging in shared decision making can also address the issue of antibiotic resistance or the local prevalence of other pathogens (such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive Staphylococcus aureus) with patients facing this decision.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 2 outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing initiating antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage, which are also accessible as decision aids along with the evidence in an expanded format to support shared decision making in MAGICapp. The antibiotic course was typically five to 10 days in the RCTs, and dosing varied. TMP-SMX may slightly increase the risk of congenital malformations, including neural tube defects, when prescribed to pregnant women.

Costs and resources

TMP-SMX is inexpensive; clindamycin is probably more expensive in most places. However, the overall impact on costs to the individual and the healthcare payer are uncertain when the consequences of each option are considered.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113129Bg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are commonly encountered infections in various healthcare settings. Over the last 2 decades, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as the most common cause of purulent skin infections in the United States with accompanying higher rates of complications (eg, abscess), recurrence, and treatment failures, often leading to hospitalization. The overall burden of managing such common infections has resulted in added healthcare costs.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of ABSSSI includes cellulitis/erysipelas, major skin abscesses, and wound infections, with all requiring a minimum lesion surface area of 75 cm 2 (Table 1). ABSSSI is a common reason for patients seeking care in various healthcare settings, including emergency departments. Most are treated effectively as outpatients. The decision-making process for admitting patients to the hospital for ABSSSI is complex and often very subjective. In general, patients with all of the following characteristics can be managed as outpatients: no signs of sepsis, low suspicion of deep soft tissue infection including necrotizing fasciitis, and lack of exacerbation of comorbidities. For the majority of patients, empiric treatment is most often directed against gram-positive cocci.

Table 1.
US Food and Drug Administration Definition of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

During hospitalization, healthcare providers may need to reevaluate antimicrobial treatment and the need for surgical intervention. Antimicrobial therapy may need to be adjusted, particularly in the elderly due to comorbidities such as renal insufficiency. Once culture and susceptibility results are available, if indicated, deescalation of antimicrobial therapy is recommended. Of note, the role of MRSA in cellulitis without a wound or purulence is not as clear due to the absence of culturable material.

Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection. Although many of the studies discussed here have used different terms to describe these infections, such as complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated skin and soft-tissue infections, throughout the article I will refer to them as ABSSSI.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Current treatment options for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^112wK17c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

During the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United States and elsewhere. The most common such infections are those involving the skin and skin structures. Although a number of these lesions (including small furuncles and abscesses) respond well to surgical incision and drainage, oral antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat these infections in outpatients. Unfortunately, with the exception of linezolid, none of the agents presently being used in this fashion has been subjected to rigorous clinical trial. Thus, current therapy is based largely on anecdotal evidence. For more-serious infections requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobials such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline are presently available and have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized, prospective, double-blind trials.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term "skin and soft-tissue infections" describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

Skin and soft tissue infections — culture indications and specimen approach emphasize that for the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) treated in the outpatient setting, and whether lesion or tissue cultures are beneficial in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low; cultures are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue involvement. In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma-associated, surgical site, burn wound, fungal, viral, human and animal bites, and device-related, and although S. aureus, especially MRSA, and S. pyogenes are the causative agents in the majority of these infections, other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are important and require appropriate medical and therapeutic management. At minimum, a Gram stain should be performed to assess and characterize indicators of surface contamination or infection combined with a description of morphotypes.

Initial episode antibiotic therapy for patients with SSTIs and fever and neutropenia — treatment: Hospitalization and empiric antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin plus antipseudomonal antibiotics such as cefepime, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem or doripenem) or piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended. Documented clinical and microbiologic SSTIs should be treated based on antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolated organisms. It is recommended that the treatment duration for most bacterial SSTIs should be 7–14 days. Surgical intervention is rarely necessary to debride soft tissue abscesses after marrow recovery or for a progressive polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis. Adjunct colony-stimulating factor therapy (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) or granulocyte transfusions are not routinely recommended. Acyclovir should be administered to patients suspected or confirmed to have cutaneous or disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection.

### Current international and national guidelines for managing skin and soft tissue infections [^111a7LNw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections account for a significant percentage of both community and nosocomial infections. Several nosological entities are included in this concept. However, there is a very scarce body of doctrine for their treatment based on randomised trials. Therefore, we considered it necessary to review current treatment guidelines to bring new recommendations and improvements to our colleagues. In this review of recent literature, we identified updated guidelines in this area by searching the databases PubMed, evidence-based medicine online, York University reviewers group, Cochrane, MBE-Trip and Sumsearch using the terms: soft tissue infection, therapy, guideline.

Recent Findings

Developments focus on using new antimicrobials and on the prescription of shorter antibiotic treatment courses.

Summary

With the development of new drugs and the current evidence of their use, there is a need to refine the appropriate drug's decision-making. Drugs with a long half-life, which allows weekly administration, can reduce hospital admission and length of stay with fewer healthcare resources. Shorter courses of antibiotics are recommended. The role of stewardship programmes will continue to expand. The surgical indication and its value are evident in many patients. Therefore, management should rely on a collaborative group with experience in this disease.

SSTIs may be also classified according to the anatomical tissue layers involved. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles are located at the epidermal and dermal layer, while cellulitis is located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Deep infections extend below the dermis and may involve the subcutaneous tissue, fascial planes, or muscular compartments presenting as complex abscesses, fasciitis, or myonecrosis.

Complicated SSTIs may also be classified as non-necrotizing or necrotizing infections. Necrotizing infections most commonly involve the muscular fascial layers but may also involve the dermal, subcutaneous, and muscle layers and warrant prompt, aggressive surgical debridement.

In 2014, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections. The guidelines divided infections by purulent and non-purulent, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and tissue necrosis (necrotizing versus non-necrotizing).

Recently, the US FDA has introduced the new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) to more closely define complicated soft-tissue infection for the purposes of registration trials. ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, and major cutaneous abscesses. Thus, an ABSSSI is defined as a bacterial infection of the skin with a lesion size area of ≥ 75 cm 2 (lesion size measured by the area of redness, edema, or induration).

In 2015, the WSES published its guidelines for management of SSTIs proposing a new definition dividing SSTIs in three main groups: surgical site infections (SSIs), non-necrotizing SSTIs, and necrotizing SSTIs. SSIs are classified into two subgroups: incisional and organ and organ/space. The incisional SSIs are further divided into superficial (skin and subcutaneous tissue) and deep (deep soft-tissue muscle and fascia). Organ and organ/space infections are not truly soft-tissue infections. Non-necrotizing SSTIs including erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, simple abscess, and complex abscess may be treated by antibiotics or drainage alone.

Nocardia — cutaneous infection management in immunocompromised hosts: Cutaneous Nocardia infections usually represent metastatic foci from a primary pulmonary source, and the dermatologic manifestations are usually limited to subcutaneous nodules or abscesses and panniculitis. Sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SMX‑TMP) remains the treatment of choice, with alternatives including other sulfa antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole), amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, third‑generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), minocycline, extended‑spectrum fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin), linezolid, and dapsone. Combination therapy with other agents should be considered in patients with severe infections or profound and lasting immunodeficiency. Prolonged therapy is important, and the duration of treatment (6–24 months) should take into account disseminated disease and the extent of underlying immunosuppression. Surgical debridement is recommended for necrotic nodules or large subcutaneous abscesses.

### Clinical characteristics and antibiotic utilization in pediatric patients hospitalized with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection [^114VeMnw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) in children are increasingly frequent, but little is known about antibiotic utilization. In adults, recent studies suggest substantial opportunity to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use and shorten therapy. We sought to determine whether similar opportunity exists in children.

Methods

This was a planned secondary analysis of a pediatric cohort taken from a multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for ABSSSI between June 1, 2010, and May 31, 2012. The prespecified primary endpoint was a composite of 2 prescribing practices: (1) use of antibiotics with broad Gram-negative activity or (2) treatment duration > 10 days.

Results

One-hundred and two patients ≤ 18 years old were included: 43 had non-purulent cellulitis, 19 had wound infection or purulent cellulitis and 40 had cutaneous abscess. The median age was 5 years (range 45 days to 18 years). Clindamycin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic during hospitalization (67% of cases) and at discharge (66% of cases). The median duration of therapy was 11 days (interquartile range 10–12) and was similar for all 3 types of ABSSSI. The primary endpoint occurred in 67% of cases, including broad Gram-negative therapy in 25% and treatment duration > 10 days in 61%. By multivariate logistic regression, admission through an emergency department and management by a medical (vs. surgical) service were independently associated with the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

Children hospitalized for ABSSSI are frequently exposed to antibiotics with broad Gram-negative activity or treated longer than 10 days suggesting opportunity to reduce antibiotic use.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Three hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, comparative study for complicated skin and skin structure infections. The patients were randomized to receive either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (IV followed by oral), or an approved comparator for a median of 10 ± 4.7 days. As is expected in complicated skin and skin structure infections, surgical procedures were performed in the levofloxacin and comparator groups. Surgery (incision and drainage or debridement) was performed on 45% of the levofloxacin-treated patients and 44% of the comparator-treated patients, either shortly before or during antibiotic treatment and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication.

Among those who could be evaluated clinically 2 to 5 days after completion of study drug, overall success rates (improved or cured) were 116/138 (84.1%) for patients treated with levofloxacin and 106/132 (80.3%) for patients treated with the comparator.

Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 68% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with infected wounds and abscesses. These rates were equivalent to those seen with comparator drugs.

In 2018, the US FDA introduced the new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) to more closely define complicated soft-tissue infection for the purposes of registration trials. ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, and major cutaneous abscesses. Thus, an ABSSSI is defined by FDA as a bacterial skin infection with a lesion size area of ≥ 75 cm 2 (lesion size measured by the area of redness, edema, or induration).

In 2015, WSES published its guidelines for the management of SSTIs, proposing a new definition dividing SSTIs into three main groups: surgical site infections (SSIs), non-necrotizing SSTIs, and necrotizing SSTIs. SSIs are classified into two subgroups: (a) incisional and (b) organ and organ/space. The incisional SSIs are divided into superficial (skin and subcutaneous tissue) and deep (deep soft-tissue muscle and fascia). Organ and organ/space infections are not truly soft-tissue infections. SSIs represent a separate topic among soft-tissue infections. They are post-operative infections, and they are framed into a separate group because of their multifaceted aspects. Non-necrotizing SSTIs, including erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, simple abscess, and a complex abscess, may be treated by antibiotics or drainage alone. Necrotizing SSTIs require surgical intervention, including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

In 2018 an expert panel from the WSES and SIS-E recommended the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should always be assessed independently to classify patients with SSTIs.

### Microbiology and initial antibiotic therapy for injection drug users and non-injection drug users with cutaneous abscesses in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114j7ABt]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The incidence of cutaneous abscesses has increased markedly since the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Injection drug use is a risk factor for abscesses and may affect the microbiology and treatment of these infections. In a cohort of patients hospitalized with cutaneous abscesses in the era of CA-MRSA, the objectives were to compare the microbiology of abscesses between injection drug users and non-injection drug users and evaluate antibiotic therapy started in the emergency department (ED) in relation to microbiologic findings and national guideline treatment recommendations.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of two published retrospective cohorts of patients requiring hospitalization for acute bacterial skin infections between January 1, 2007, and May 31, 2012, in seven academic and community hospitals in Colorado. In the subgroup of patients with cutaneous abscesses, microbiologic findings and the antibiotic regimens started in the ED were compared between injection drug users and non-injection drug users. Antibiotic regimens involving multiple agents, lack of activity against MRSA, or an agent with broad Gram-negative activity were classified as discordant with Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline treatment recommendations.

Results

Of 323 patients with cutaneous abscesses, 104 (32%) occurred in injection drug users. Among the 235 cases where at least one microorganism was identified by culture, S. aureus was identified less commonly among injection drug users compared with non-injection drug users (55% vs. 75%, p = 0.003), with similar patterns observed for MRSA (33% vs. 47%, p = 0.054) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (17% vs. 26%, p = 0.11). In contrast to S. aureus, streptococcal species (53% vs. 25%, p < 0.001) and anaerobic organisms (29% vs. 10%, p < 0.001) were identified more commonly among injection drug users. Of 88 injection drug users and 186 non-injection drug users for whom antibiotics were started in the ED, the antibiotic regimens were discordant with IDSA guideline recommendations in 47 (53%) and 101 (54%), respectively (p = 0.89). In cases where MRSA was ultimately identified, the antibiotic regimen started in the ED lacked activity against this pathogen in 14% of cases.

Conclusions

Compared with non-injection drug users, cutaneous abscesses in injection drug users were less likely to involve S. aureus, including MRSA, and more likely to involve streptococci and anaerobes; however, MRSA was common in both groups. Antibiotic regimens started in the ED were discordant with national guidelines in over half of cases and often lacked activity against MRSA when this pathogen was present.

### Should we wait for development of an abscess before we perform incision and drainage? [^111B3HT9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections are infections (either abscess or cellulitis) that are within the potential spaces and fascial planes of the head and neck. Deep neck infections should not be ignored, and no surgeon should underestimate the necessity of appropriate and timely treatment of deep neck infections due to the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of these infections. This article discusses and reviews the literature with regard to a question that has long been debated in the surgical literature, "Should we wait for the development of an abscess before performing incision and drainage?"

### Impact of an electronic medical-record-embedded clinical-decision support tool on duration of antibiotics for outpatient pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections [^11715JoP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Intervention timeline

The Michigan Medicine Ambulatory Antimicrobial Stewardship Program instituted serial interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for outpatient pediatric SSTI. The primary intervention was a pediatric SmartSet, an EMR-embedded CDS tool used to guide therapy at the time of the visit (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, Wisconsin).

Institutional SSTI treatment guidelines for pediatric and adult patients were developed in July 2019, followed by dedicated SSTI education for general pediatricians in May 2020. General medicine and family medicine practitioners received generalized education on the management of common infections, including SSTI. The pediatric SmartSet was developed with a general pediatrics champion and was implemented in December 2020. It includes a templated progress note and prepopulated options for guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing based on diagnosis (impetigo, cellulitis, or abscess). In May 2021, a Tableau dashboard (Tableau software, Seattle, WA) was developed with the quality and analytics team. The dashboard displays the rate of prescriptions with an inappropriate antibiotic duration for adult and pediatric SSTI, as well as rates by clinic and provider, allowing for individual review of inappropriate cases.

Study design, setting, and population

In this quasi-experimental, before-and after study, adult patients (aged ≥ 21 years) and pediatric patients (aged 2 months to < 21 years) were included if they were prescribed an enteral antibiotic within 3 days of a Michigan Medicine primary care or general surgery encounter (ie, in-person, virtual, or telephone) with an International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for impetigo, cellulitis, or cutaneous abscess. Prescriptions of < 3 days or > 14 days were excluded because these durations were likely not prescribed for uncomplicated SSTI. The SmartSet was implemented in December 2020. The preintervention period was July 2019 through December 2020, and the postintervention period was January 2021 through December 2021.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric SSTI with an inappropriate duration, defined as > 7 days. Institutional SSTI guidelines, consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, recommend 5-day treatment courses for impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess, with extension to 7 days for slow clinical response.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^1125JJvB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### Randomized, controlled trial of antibiotics in the management of community-acquired skin abscesses in the pediatric patient [^1126Woy3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Emergency department visits for skin and soft tissue infections are increasing with the discovery of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Whether abscesses treated surgically also require antibiotics is controversial. There are no published pediatric randomized controlled trials evaluating the need for antibiotics in skin abscess management. We determine the benefits of antibiotics in surgically managed pediatric skin abscesses.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Pediatric patients were randomized to receive 10 days of placebo or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after incision and draining. Follow-up consisted of a visit/call at 10 to 14 days and a call at 90 days. Primary outcome was treatment failure at the 10-day follow-up. Secondary outcome was new lesion development at the 10- and 90-day follow-ups. Noninferiority of placebo relative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for primary and secondary outcomes was assessed.

Results

One hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled, with 12 lost to follow-up. The failure rates were 5.3% (n = 4/76) and 4.1% (n = 3/73) in the placebo and antibiotic groups, respectively, yielding a difference of 1.2%, with a 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (-infinity to 6.8%). Noninferiority was established with an equivalence threshold of 7%. New lesions occurred at the 10-day follow-up: 19 on placebo (26.4%) and 9 on antibiotics (12.9%), yielding a difference of 13.5%, with 95% 1-sided CI (-infinity to 24.3%). At the 3-month follow-up, 15 of 52 (28.8%) in the placebo group and 13 of 46 (28.3%) in the antibiotic group developed new lesions. The difference was 0.5%, with 95% 1-sided CI (-infinity to 15.6%).

Conclusion

Antibiotics are not required for pediatric skin abscess resolution. Antibiotics may help prevent new lesions in the short term, but further studies are required.

### Routine packing of simple cutaneous abscesses is painful and probably unnecessary [^111uGL8f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine whether the routine packing of simple cutaneous abscesses after incision and drainage (I&D) confers any benefit over I&D alone.

Methods

In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial, subjects with simple cutaneous abscesses (less than 5 cm largest diameter) underwent incision, drainage, irrigation, and standard abscess preparation in the usual manner. Subjects were then randomized to either packing or no-packing. Visual analog scales (VAS; 100 mm) of pain were recorded in the emergency department (ED). All patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ibuprofen, and narcotic prescriptions, recorded twice daily VAS pain scores, and returned in 48 hours at which time dressings and packing, if present, were removed and a physician blinded to the randomization and not part of the initial visit repeated measurements and determined the need for further intervention.

Results

Forty-eight subjects were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences in age, sex, abscess location, or initial pain scores between the two groups. There was no significant difference in need for a second intervention at the 48-hour follow-up between the packed (4 of 23 subjects) and nonpacked (5 of 25 subjects) groups (p = 0.72; relative risk = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 4.2). Patients in the group that received packing reported higher pain scores immediately postprocedure (mean difference = 23.8 mm; p = 0.014, 95% CI = 5 to 42 mm) and at 48 hours postprocedure (mean difference = 16.4 mm; p = 0.03, 95% CI = 1.6 to 31.2 mm), as well as greater use of ibuprofen (mean difference = 0.32; p = 0.12, 95% CI = -1.4 to 2.0) and oxycodone/acetaminophen (mean difference = 2.19; p = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.2 to 4.1).

Conclusion

In this pilot study, not packing simple cutaneous abscesses did not result in any increased morbidity, and patients reported less pain and used fewer pain medications than packed patients.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111jEtWA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^117Va5vM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Independent risk factors for PD failure are bowel wall thickness, disease length, bowel dilation, and abscess size of greater than 6 cm. Furthermore, multiple percutaneous drainage procedures have been required in 8–20% of patients and it could increase the risk of complications such as damage to vital structures in close proximity to the abscess or severe hemorrhage.

Complications of PD, for both spontaneous and post-surgical abscesses (not specific to CD), occur in approximately 10% of procedures. Major complications such as sepsis, small bowel fistulae, colon perforation, and death (due to sepsis or hemorrhage) have been described in 5–11% of cases. Minor complications (such as bacteremia or infection at the site of the catheter insertion) occur in approximately 3%.

Feagins et al. suggested that non-drainable abscesses smaller than 3 cm and without evidence of fistula and no steroid therapy are likely to respond to antibiotic therapy alone although with high recurrence rates. In this setting, antibiotics should cover Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes and it is important to closely observe the clinical condition of the patient in case of any deterioration.

Antibiotic therapy, including a combination of fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole in patients with CD, should be adapted to the sensitivity of the bacteria (and sometimes fungi) to antibiotics, if PD is performed.

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy is unclear. Clinical improvement should be seen within 3–5 days after starting antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, with a decrease in drainage production. If a patient's condition does not improve, re-evaluation and repeat imaging are indicated to determine whether the abscess has been adequately drained. If not, repositioning of the drain or surgical intervention is required.

If sepsis is controlled after adequate PD, CD medication should be started to prevent recurrence. Patients with a concomitant stenosis, an entero-cutaneous fistula or refractory active disease are likely to require surgery, but preoperative PD, if it is feasible, associated with delayed surgery, can decrease the extent of intestinal resection, postoperative septic complications, and potentially reduce stoma rates.

Q.4: In patients presenting with complications related to IBD, what is the appropriate medical treatment and nutritional support?

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^115egG64]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of surgical therapy of an abscess is to drain the abscess expeditiously, identify a fistula tract, and either proceed with primary fistulotomy to prevent recurrence or place a draining seton for future consideration.

A large abscess should be drained with multiple counter incisions rather than a long incision, which will create a step-off deformity and delay wound healing.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens and are frequently polymicrobial in origin.

Although most cases can be managed by incision and drainage, abscesses in injecting drug users require special considerations as compared to soft-tissue infections, which are not caused by intravenous drug abuse. There are two main sources of organisms: the injecting drug users themselves (their oropharynx, skin, or feces), and the environment. Contamination may occur when the user prepares or injects the drug, uses shared needles, or re-uses injection paraphernalia. Manufacturing and handling of injectable drugs may be far from hygienic rules. Persistent signs of systemic infection require evaluation for the presence of endocarditis. Foreign bodies, such as broken needles, should be ruled out by radiography, and duplex sonography should be performed to identify the presence of vascular complications. Viral (HIV, HCV, HBV) acute or chronic infections should be always ruled out. Broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms should be administered in patients with these infections. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA in some areas, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Management of subcutaneous abscesses: prospective cross-sectional study (MAGIC) [^113tJBcU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subcutaneous abscesses are pus-filled cavities within the dermis and subdermal layers caused by a local bacterial infection, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus. They are a common presentation, with an incidence of 433 per 100 000 presentations in community practice, leading to 236 per 100 000 admissions to hospital each year. Surgical drainage is the conventional approach used to treat abscesses in the hospital setting. This aims to achieve complete evacuation of pus, thorough irrigation, and healing by secondary intention.

In the UK, no widely established guidance exists for the management of subcutaneous abscesses. The results of a survey of general surgeons in 2018 highlighted stark disparities in the everyday management of abscesses, such as in the choice of anaesthesia, the role of cavity packing, and the role of swabs for culture; in particular, uncertainty surrounding the use of general or local anaesthesia during surgical drainage was shown to exist. A cohort study at a large teaching hospital later demonstrated the safety of a protocolized care pathway for drainage under local anaesthesia when applied to the majority (84%) of patients with uncomplicated abscesses. The choice of anaesthesia remains of interest due to its potential impact on health resources, costs, the environment, and emergency care capacity.

Another uncertainty is the role of antibiotics after surgical drainage. In the previous survey, the majority of respondents indicated that antibiotics were only indicated sometimes (39.3%) or in rare circumstances (44.3%). This was in contrast to a recently published practice recommendation, advocating for the routine use of antimicrobial therapy after surgical drainage, specifically trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin. This recommendation was made owing to the results of a systematic review published in 2018, which demonstrated a modest reduction in abscess recurrence with antibiotics across 14 RCTs. In contrast, the review revealed an increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhoea, and also raised concerns about other possible harms, such as from antimicrobial resistance.

The aim of this study was to explore the management of subcutaneous abscesses in emergency surgical practice in the UK. In doing so, the study aimed to describe the UK experience of local anaesthesia as the primary anaesthetic modality for surgical drainage and the experience of antibiotic therapy as an adjuvant treatment after surgery.

### Dalbavancin (Dalvance) [^113D4ccF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A study population of 191 pediatric patients received study medication (DALVANCE single dose regimen n = 83, DALVANCE two-dose regimen n = 78, comparator n = 30); 62% of the patients were male and 89% were white, and 83% were from Eastern Europe. The pediatric age groups who received DALVANCE were as follows: 12 to < 18 years (n = 58), 6 to < 12 years (n = 49), 2 to < 6 years (n = 35), 3 months to < 2 years (n = 14), and birth < 3 months (n = 5). Patients had diagnoses of major cutaneous abscess (53%), cellulitis (29%), or surgical site/traumatic wound infection (18%). The predominant pathogen at baseline was Staphylococcus aureus (84%).

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DALVANCE. The trial was not powered for a comparative inferential efficacy analysis. Efficacy was assessed in the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 183) which included all randomized patients who received any dose of study drug and had a diagnosis of ABSSSI caused by Gram-positive organism(s). Patients with ABSSSI only caused by Gram-negative organisms were excluded. The five patients in the age group birth to < 3 months of age were not included in efficacy analyses since they were enrolled with expanded inclusion criteria and only received the single dose DALVANCE regimen. An early clinical response at 48–72 hours was defined as ≥ 20% reduction in lesion size compared to baseline and no receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. The proportion of patients with early clinical response, was 97.3% (73/75) in the DALVANCE single-dose arm, 93.6% (73/78) in the DALVANCE two-dose arm, and 86.7% (26/30) in the comparator arm. The difference in responder rates between the dalbavancin single-dose and comparator arms was 10.7%, with an exact 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of (-1.7%, 31.6%). The difference in responder rates between the dalbavancin two-dose and comparator arms was 6.9%, with an exact 97.5% CI of (-6.4%, 27.7%).

### Cutaneous Serratia marcescens infections in Korea: a retrospective analysis of 13 patients [^116LydbN]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Serratia marcescens is a Gram-negative bacillus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Because of increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance, this bacterium has received considerable attention and has emerged as an important pathogen. In order to reveal clinical and microbiological characteristics of S. marcescens cutaneous infection and to suggest appropriate antibiotic treatment, we retrospectively analyzed 17 strains isolated from wound swabs of Korean patients between November 2005 and March 2014. A total of 13 patients (five men and eight women) were included in our study, with a mean age of 46.3 years (range, 21–82). Based on medical history, seven patients were classified as immunocompromised. Prior predisposing factors for infections were noted in 12 patients, including pre-existing leg ulcers or dermatitis (5/13), preceding cancer surgeries (2/13), plastic surgeries and filler injection (2/13), traumas (2/13) and medical procedures following cutaneous abscess (1/13). Cutaneous infections showed various clinical presentations, including spontaneous dermal abscess, fingernail change, painful nodules and papular erosions. We found that third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, levofloxacin and meropenem appeared active against all 17 strains in vitro. Clinically, all patients treated with empirical first-generation cephalosporin showed treatment resistance, and oral quinolone monotherapy was the most preferred antibiotic regimen without treatment failure, with an average treatment duration of 25 days (range, 14–42). This study demonstrates the various clinical presentations and treatment responses for cutaneous S. marcescens infection. Moreover, we suggest that initial antibiotic coverage should be broad enough to account for multidrug resistance in this rare pathogen.
