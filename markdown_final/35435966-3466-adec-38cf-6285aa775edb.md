## Question

Antibiotics for dental surgery in pediatric patients with systolic murmur

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for dental procedures in a pediatric patient with a systolic murmur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a systolic murmur implies diagnostically and whether it corresponds to a high-risk cardiac condition. Then, I should verify which pediatric cardiac conditions actually warrant prophylaxis according to current guidelines. Next, I will review the evidence base for prophylaxis efficacy and the balance of benefits versus harms. After that, I need to check pediatric-specific dosing and timing if prophylaxis were indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note any exceptions or controversies that might alter practice in select scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a systolic murmur in a child is common and often innocent, but it can also reflect structural heart disease such as a ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, or other valvular abnormalities. Importantly, the mere presence of a murmur does not by itself define infective endocarditis risk or indicate prophylaxis, so I need to anchor on the underlying cardiac diagnosis rather than the auscultatory finding alone [^notfound].

> Next, I should review which pediatric cardiac conditions are high risk and warrant antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures that manipulate gingival tissue or the periapical region. Current AHA and ACC/AHA guidance restrict prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic valves or prosthetic material used for valve repair, prior infective endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired CHD with residual defects, and cardiac transplant recipients who develop valvulopathy; notably, isolated innocent murmurs, uncomplicated VSDs, and mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation are not included in the high-risk category, so prophylaxis is not recommended for these conditions [^b19e41b1] [^04823e22] [^3b2da4ba].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the evidence base for prophylaxis efficacy. The Cochrane review found no randomized or controlled evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces infective endocarditis in at-risk patients undergoing dental procedures, and a single small case-control study showed no protective effect. Observational data also suggest that everyday bacteremias from chewing or toothbrushing likely contribute more to endocarditis than procedure-related bacteremias, limiting the potential impact of a single preprocedural dose [^438180dc] [^910d77df] [^dc7c83f8].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms and stewardship. Unnecessary antibiotics carry risks including allergic reactions, C. difficile infection, and antimicrobial resistance. Large cohort analyses show that more than 80% of dental prophylaxis prescriptions are discordant with guidelines, underscoring the need to avoid reflexive prescribing in low-risk patients, especially children who also face developmental dental risks with repeated antibiotic exposures such as amoxicillin-associated enamel defects in early childhood [^64ae32b1] [^571af059] [^6482042c].

> Let me consider pediatric dosing in case prophylaxis is actually indicated for a high-risk condition. If indicated, the AHA regimen is a single dose 30–60 minutes before the procedure: amoxicillin 50 mg/kg orally (maximum 2 g), with alternatives for penicillin allergy such as azithromycin 15 mg/kg, clarithromycin 15 mg/kg, clindamycin 20 mg/kg, or cephalexin 50 mg/kg; if unable to take oral medications, ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV/IM or cefazolin/ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV/IM are options, with clindamycin 20 mg/kg IV/IM for severe beta-lactam allergy; I should double-check that these pediatric dosing references align with the AHA dental prophylaxis tables, which they do [^7bdc4db0].

> But wait, what if the murmur reflects mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow obstruction; could that change the calculus? Contemporary guidance still classifies MVP without high-risk features as intermediate risk and does not recommend prophylaxis, and HCM is not a formal indication in AHA/ACC/ESC documents, though some centers and case reports argue for prophylaxis in HCM with obstruction. This remains controversial and not guideline-endorsed, so I should document shared decision-making if a family requests prophylaxis off-label in such scenarios [^dff8a2a6] [^c30b11d9] [^eaab22f5].

> I should confirm real-world impact data to reassure myself that restricting prophylaxis has not increased pediatric endocarditis. Population-level studies after the 2007 AHA restriction showed no significant increase in pediatric IE hospitalizations, supporting the safety of the narrowed indications, although ongoing vigilance is prudent and some studies in adults have suggested possible increases in very high-risk subgroups like prosthetic valve patients, which does not directly alter pediatric low-risk practice [^550c8905] [^19ad56ec].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for a pediatric patient with an isolated systolic murmur unless the murmur reflects one of the high-risk cardiac conditions listed above. The priority is to establish the underlying diagnosis, ensure excellent oral hygiene and access to dental care, and reserve prophylaxis for those who truly meet high-risk criteria, documenting the rationale and counseling families about the limited and unproven benefit in low-risk settings [^b19e41b1] [^04823e22] [^dc7c83f8].

---

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for pediatric patients with a systolic murmur undergoing dental procedures unless the murmur reflects a high-risk cardiac condition [^b19e41b1] [^04823e22]. Prophylaxis is reserved for patients with prosthetic valves, prior infective endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, or repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects [^b19e41b1] [^04823e22]. For high-risk patients, give **amoxicillin 50 mg/kg** orally 30–60 minutes before procedures involving gingival manipulation or periapical tissue [^7bdc4db0]. If amoxicillin is unsuitable, use azithromycin 15 mg/kg, clarithromycin 15 mg/kg, or clindamycin 20 mg/kg orally [^7bdc4db0]. Emphasize **oral hygiene** and regular dental care to reduce risk [^dc7c83f8] [^4bb0cc5a].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

The **AHA 2007 guidelines** state that antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for patients with innocent murmurs or other low-risk cardiac conditions [^b19e41b1]. Prophylaxis is reserved for patients with specific high-risk cardiac conditions, including:

- Prosthetic cardiac valves or prosthetic material used for valve repair [^b19e41b1].
- Previous infective endocarditis [^b19e41b1].
- Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, including palliative shunts or conduits [^b19e41b1].
- Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device during the first six months after the procedure [^b19e41b1].
- Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device [^b19e41b1].

The **ESC 2023 guidelines** similarly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis only for patients with high-risk cardiac conditions undergoing dental procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth [^7c654630] [^b3930614]. For patients at low or intermediate risk, including those with innocent murmurs, prophylaxis is not recommended [^e637b73e].

---

## Evidence supporting current guidelines

The rationale for restricting antibiotic prophylaxis to high-risk patients is based on several lines of evidence:

- **Low absolute risk**: The absolute risk of infective endocarditis from dental procedures is extremely low, even in patients with underlying cardiac conditions [^751eae85].
- **Lack of efficacy**: There is no convincing evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of infective endocarditis in low-risk patients [^438180dc].
- **Potential harms**: Antibiotic prophylaxis carries risks of allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, and other adverse effects, particularly with repeated exposures [^88404cd7] [^70a5c7e9].

---

## Pediatric-specific considerations

Pediatric patients with systolic murmurs often have innocent murmurs or other low-risk cardiac conditions. The **AHA guidelines** explicitly state that antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for innocent murmurs or other low-risk conditions [^b19e41b1]. Additionally, pediatric patients are more susceptible to antibiotic-related adverse effects, including allergic reactions and antibiotic resistance, further supporting the cautious use of prophylaxis [^70a5c7e9].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring antibiotic prophylaxis

In pediatric patients with systolic murmurs, antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated only if the murmur is associated with one of the high-risk cardiac conditions mentioned above. Examples include:

- A child with a systolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation [^notfound].
- A child with a systolic murmur due to a ventricular septal defect with residual shunt [^notfound].
- A child with a systolic murmur due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction [^notfound].

In these scenarios, prophylaxis is recommended because the underlying cardiac condition places the patient at increased risk of adverse outcomes from infective endocarditis [^b19e41b1].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, the following **regimens are recommended**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Route** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 50 mg/kg | Oral | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Azithromycin | 15 mg/kg | Oral | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Clarithromycin | 15 mg/kg | Oral | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Clindamycin | 20 mg/kg | Oral | 30–60 minutes before procedure |

---

If the patient is allergic to penicillin or amoxicillin, alternative antibiotics such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, or clindamycin should be used [^7bdc4db0].

---

## Clinical scenarios not requiring antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for pediatric patients with systolic murmurs in the following scenarios:

- Innocent murmurs (e.g. Still's murmur, venous hum) [^notfound].
- Functional murmurs without underlying structural heart disease [^notfound].
- Mild mitral regurgitation without significant valvular deformity [^notfound].
- Small ventricular septal defects without residual shunt [^notfound].

---

## Emphasis on oral hygiene and regular dental care

Regardless of the need for antibiotic prophylaxis, maintaining **good oral hygiene** and regular dental care is essential for pediatric patients with systolic murmurs. Poor oral hygiene significantly increases the risk of bacteremia and infective endocarditis, making preventive dental care a critical component of overall cardiovascular health [^dc7c83f8] [^4bb0cc5a].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for pediatric patients with systolic murmurs undergoing dental procedures unless the murmur reflects a high-risk cardiac condition [^b19e41b1]. Prophylaxis should be reserved for patients with specific high-risk cardiac conditions, and the decision to administer prophylaxis should be individualized based on the underlying cardiac diagnosis and risk assessment. Emphasis should be placed on maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental care to minimize the risk of infective endocarditis [^dc7c83f8].

### Commentary: experience and expertise prevail when guidelines fail [^c30b11d9]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition, a discussion is warranted regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with HCM. The authors report that the patient underwent "extensive dental work" but did not receive prophylactic antibiotics. According to the 2016 American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines, antibiotics are recommended for patients with congenital heart disease only if they have cyanotic disease or have undergone repair with prosthetic material. Likewise, although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines acknowledge that patients with HCM are at increased risk of endocarditis, prophylaxis is not routinely recommended. Nonetheless, at our institution, patients with HCM and evidence of LVOT obstruction would receive prophylactic antibiotics, as we believe the benefits outweigh the risks for this patient population.

Guidelines specific for pediatric patients with HCM and those with congenital heart disease undergoing dental procedures are not as robust as we would like, making it a necessity to thoroughly weigh the risks and benefits of various treatment options. This case report highlights that necessity. Although the treatment strategy and timing of intervention can be debated, we commend the authors on their successful management of this unique clinical scenario.

Though endocarditis is seen at increased rates in patients with MVP, and despite calls to use prophylaxis in all patients with MVP who have evidence of regurgitation, MVP is currently defined as an intermediate risk cardiac condition for endocarditis, and as such, antibiotic prophylaxis for this condition is not recommended. Historically, this has been a controversial issue. Assuming 2% to 3% of the population are living with MVP, this would mean putting millions of patients on antibiotic prophylaxis, which would be a significant economic burden and, an enormous cost to the healthcare system, and a burden for patients, in addition to the problematic effects such a strategy would have on emerging antibiotic resistance. Nonetheless, since the changes in guidelines in 2007, the prevalence of endocarditis attributable to streptococcal species has been rising. Studies have identified subgroups that would benefit more from prophylaxis; restricting antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with a systolic murmur, for example, is estimated to provide cover to ≈90% of patients likely to develop infective endocarditis. Further, recent studies have suggested that restricting antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with MVP undergoing dental procedures could be of benefit, given that the vast majority of bacteria causing IE in patients with MVP originate from the mouth. Nonetheless, current guidelines find insufficient evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis would be effective in preventing infective endocarditis in MVP.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^34036405]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that despite a substantial decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England since the introduction of NICE guideline No 64 in March 2008 there has been no significant increase in the number of cases of infective endocarditis, as measured using data from hospital episode statistics.

Some clinicians remain concerned that the NICE recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom, and the reduced number of patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in the United States and Europe as a result of the restriction of antibiotic prophylaxis to patients thought to be at high risk in the latest American Heart Associationand European Society of Cardiologyguidelines, will result in an increased incidence of infective endocarditis. Although one small study found no cause for concern after the change in the American Heart Association guidelinesthe present trial is the first large scale study to evaluate the effect of the NICE guideline recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis.

Although these findings lend support to the NICE guideline recommendations and suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures is unlikely to be of value in preventing infective endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, our findings do not exclude the possibility that a small number of patients at highest risk, such as those with prosthetic valves, might benefit. Ongoing monitoring of the data is required for confirmation, and further studies are needed to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in protecting a small group of patients at highest risk from infective endocarditis.

American Heart Association antibiotic regimens — general principles for dental prophylaxis specify that an antibiotic for prophylaxis should be administered in a single dose before the procedure; if the preprocedural dose is inadvertently not given, the dosage may be administered up to two hours after the procedure, and administration after the procedure should be considered only when the patient did not receive the preprocedural dose. When fever or other manifestations of systemic infection are present, it is important to obtain blood cultures and other relevant tests before administration of antibiotics intended to prevent infective endocarditis.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — future considerations emphasize that 'prospective placebo-controlled double-blinded studies of antibiotic prophylaxis of IE in patients who undergo a bacteremia-producing procedure would be necessary to evaluate accurately the efficacy of IE prophylaxis', and that 'additional prospective case-control studies are needed'. The guideline expects that 'significantly fewer patients will receive IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure' and that 'studies are necessary to monitor the effects, if any, of these recommended changes in IE prophylaxis', while noting that 'because the incidence of IE is low, small changes in incidence may take years to detect'. It urges that studies be 'designed and instituted promptly' and that 'subsequent revisions of the AHA guidelines on the prevention of IE will be based on the results of these studies and other published data'.

### Can we really do without antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis? [^2cf7325d]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Current guidance recommends against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis around the time of dental intervention for the prevention of infective endocarditis. The authors report the case of a previously well-patient with an asymptomatic isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) who developed evidence of infective systemic and pulmonary emboli following dental treatment. A diagnosis of severe endocarditis of a previously normal native mitral valve was made. She subsequently underwent surgical repair of her mitral valve, and closure of her VSD. She was deemed fit for discharge on parenteral antibiotics on the thirtieth postoperative day. The authors highlight the need for further re-evaluation of the issues surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the context of dental procedures.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis prophylaxis — dental procedure antibiotic regimens specify a single dose 30–60 minutes before the procedure: oral amoxicillin adults 2 grams and children 50 milligrams per kilogram. If unable to take oral medication, adults may receive ampicillin 2 g IM or IV or cefazolin or ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV, with pediatric doses 50 mg/kg IM or IV for either agent. For patients allergic to penicillins or ampicillin (oral), options are cephalexin 2 g, clindamycin 600 mg, or azithromycin or clarithromycin 500 mg in adults, with pediatric doses cephalexin 50 mg/kg, clindamycin 20 mg/kg, and azithromycin or clarithromycin 15 mg/kg. For patients allergic to penicillins or ampicillin and unable to take oral medication, adults may receive cefazolin or ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV or clindamycin 600 mg IM or IV, with pediatric doses 50 mg/kg IM or IV or 20 mg/kg IM or IV, respectively. An other first- or second-generation oral cephalosporin in equivalent adult or pediatric dosage is acceptable where indicated, but cephalosporins should not be used in a person with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema or urticaria with penicillins or ampicillin.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) background and impetus for guideline revision notes that infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon but life-threatening infection and that despite advances in diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, surgical techniques and management of complications, patients with IE still have substantial morbidity and mortality related to this condition. Since the last American Heart Association publication on prevention of IE, many authorities, societies and the conclusions of published studies have questioned the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients who undergo a dental, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract procedure and have suggested that the AHA guidelines should be revised.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Summary of major changes — rationale and scope: The guideline states that bacteremia resulting from daily activities is much more likely to cause infective endocarditis (IE) than bacteremia associated with a dental procedure, and that only an extremely small number of cases of IE might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis even if prophylaxis is 100 percent effective. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquisition of IE, recommendations for IE prophylaxis are limited only to the conditions listed in Box 3, and antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for any other form of congenital heart disease, except for the conditions listed in Box 3.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^96a03416]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Over the past 10 years a general move has been to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save cost and to prevent the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although this could have played a part in the reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction, its coincidence with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data that show a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not completely tackle the problem of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly answer this question a carefully designed, randomised, placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

Interpretation of the findings

Given that oral viridians group streptococci are clearly implicated in some cases of infective endocarditis, our findings provide support for the growing view that the frequent episodes of bacteraemia that follow daily routines such as eating and tooth brushing may be a greater risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis than the transient bacteraemia that follows an invasive dental procedure. Furthermore, the evidence that the bacteraemia after tooth brushing is significantly greater and more common in patients with poor oral hygiene and gingival diseasesuggests that improving oral hygiene might be more effective at reducing the number of cases caused by oral bacteria than providing antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental procedures.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^64ae32b1]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are antibiotics appropriately prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures?

Findings

In this cohort study of 91 438 patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis for 168 420 dental visits from 2011 to 2015, a total of 90.7% of dental visits had manipulation of the gingiva or tooth periapex, but only 20.9% of patients had a cardiac condition at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. Therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were discordant with guidelines.

Meaning

Most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures are unnecessary.

### Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association rheumatic fever, endocarditis and Kawasaki disease committee, council on cardiovascular disease in the young, and the council on clinical cardiology, council on cardiovascular surgery and anesthesia, and the quality of care and outcomes research interdisciplinary working group [^9ffc2180]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis for dental procedures — scope, timing, and strength: The Committee concludes that prophylaxis is reasonable for dental procedures for these patients during the first six months after the procedure, and the Committee does not recommend prophylaxis for dental procedures more than six months after the procedure provided that there is no residual defect from the repair. In patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE, IE prophylaxis for dental procedures is reasonable, even though we acknowledge that its effectiveness is unknown (Class IIb, LOE B). The Committee no longer recommends IE prophylaxis based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquisition of IE, and no published data demonstrate convincingly that the administration of prophylactic antibiotics prevents IE associated with bacteremia from an invasive procedure. MVP is the most common underlying condition that predisposes to acquisition of IE in the Western world; however, the absolute incidence of endocarditis is extremely low for the entire population with MVP, and it is not usually associated with the grave outcome associated with the conditions identified in Box 3; thus, IE prophylaxis is no longer recommended in this group of patients. Finally, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics is not risk-free.

Dental procedures in patients already receiving antibiotics — agent selection guidance states that if a patient is already receiving chronic antibiotic therapy with an antibiotic that is also recommended for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, it is prudent to select an antibiotic from a different class rather than to increase the dosage of the current antibiotic. For those taking an oral penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever or for other purposes and likely to harbor viridans group streptococci relatively resistant to penicillin or amoxicillin, the provider should select either clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, but only for patients shown in Box 3.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis prophylaxis for dental procedures — major updated recommendations state that the committee concluded that only an extremely small number of cases of IE might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures even if such prophylactic therapy were 100 percent effective. IE prophylaxis for dental procedures should be recommended only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE. For patients with these underlying cardiac conditions, prophylaxis is recommended for all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. Prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquisition of IE. Administration of antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for patients who undergo a genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedure.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis prevention guideline — this statement updates the recommendations by the American Heart Association for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) and was developed by a writing group appointed by the AHA with liaison members representing the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics, after reviewing input from national and international experts. The recommendations reflect analyses of relevant literature regarding procedure-related bacteremia and IE; in vitro susceptibility data of the most common microorganisms, which cause IE; results of prophylactic studies in animal models of experimental endocarditis; and retrospective and prospective studies of prevention of IE; MEDLINE database searches from 1950 through 2006 were done for English language articles. The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Dental Association has approved these guidelines as they relate to dentistry.

AHA infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — scope and consequences of revisions — states that 'substantially fewer patients will be recommended for IE prophylaxis' and that 'Substantive changes in recommendations could (1) violate long-standing expectations and practice patterns, (2) make fewer patients eligible for IE prophylaxis, (3) reduce malpractice claims related to IE prophylaxis and (4) stimulate prospective studies on IE prophylaxis'. The document explains that prior AHA guidelines 'contained ambiguities and inconsistencies and often were based on minimal published data or expert opinion' and that 'Cases of IE either temporally or remotely associated with an invasive procedure, especially a dental procedure, have frequently been the basis for malpractice claims against health care providers'. It further notes that the document 'is intended to identify which, if any, patients may possibly benefit from IE prophylaxis and to define, to the extent possible, which dental procedures should have prophylaxis in this select group of patients' and that recommendations 'must be evidence-based'; a 'placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of IE prophylaxis in patients who undergo a dental, GI or GU tract procedure has not been done' and such a study 'would require a large number of patients per treatment group'.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^7c654630]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis, dental procedures, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with any of the following undergoing oro-dental procedures:

- previous IE

Dental procedure antibiotic prophylaxis for IE — observational evidence indicates limited effectiveness. There are no prospective randomized placebo-controlled studies on the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients who undergo a dental procedure, and retrospective studies were small with insufficient clinical data. Van der Meer and colleagues concluded that dental or other procedures probably caused only a small fraction of IE cases and that prophylaxis would prevent only a small number of cases even if it were 100 percent effective. In a two-year case-control study, among patients for whom prophylaxis was recommended, five of 20 cases of IE occurred despite receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and they concluded that prophylaxis was not effective; poor awareness of recommendations for prophylaxis among both patients and health care providers was also reported. In a multicenter case-control study, control subjects without IE were more likely to have undergone a dental procedure than patients with IE (P = 0.03), dental treatment was not a risk factor for IE even in patients with valvular heart disease, and few cases of IE could be prevented with prophylaxis even if it were 100 percent effective; reported cardiac risk factors included MVP, congenital heart disease (CHD), rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and previous cardiac valve surgery. A French study of predisposed adults undergoing dental procedures with or without antibiotic prophylaxis concluded that a "huge number of prophylaxis doses would be necessary to prevent a very low number of IE cases".

Clinicians also had to weigh the potential efficacy of IE prophylaxis against the risk of adverse reaction to the antibiotic prescribed and consider medicolegal risk, with the guideline noting for dental procedures that IE prophylaxis may prevent only an exceedingly small number of IE cases.

Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a rare illness with high morbidity and mortality. Incidence of IE is on the rise in industrialized countries, particularly as those with congenital heart defects are living longer and the use of indwelling central catheters increases. With the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines, there has been a shift in recommending antibiotic prophylaxis only to high-risk patient populations. This clinical review will highlight the changing epidemiology and etiology of IE, followed by an emphasis on the appropriate indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk populations undergoing specific procedures.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: do the changes make sense? A critical review [^0c08bd23]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

Recent Findings

The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

Summary

While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

Parenteral therapy and dental procedure timing during antimicrobial treatment for infective endocarditis include deferring dental care when feasible and aligning dose timing to the procedure: If possible, it would be preferable to delay a dental procedure until at least 10 days after completion of the antibiotic therapy, and in these cases parenteral antibiotic therapy for IE should be continued with the timing of the dosage adjusted to be administered 30 to 60 minutes before the dental procedure.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis rationale and external guidance — underlying principles included that IE is an uncommon but life-threatening disease and prevention is preferable to treatment of established infection; certain underlying cardiac conditions predispose to IE; bacteremia with organisms known to cause IE occurs commonly with invasive dental, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract procedures; antimicrobial prophylaxis was proven effective for prevention of experimental IE in animals; and antimicrobial prophylaxis was thought to be effective in humans for prevention of IE associated with dental, GI or GU tract procedures. Using an evidence-based grading system, the recommendations would be Class IIb, LOE C, and the quality of evidence was limited to a few case-control studies or was based on expert opinion, clinical experience and descriptive studies, which used surrogate measures of risk. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy issued new IE prophylaxis recommendations and now recommends prophylaxis before dental procedures only for patients who have a history of previous IE or who have had cardiac valve replacement or surgically constructed pulmonary shunts or conduits.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4bb0cc5a]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only 4 categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcome. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

Methods and Results

A writing group was formed consisting of experts in prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

Conclusions

On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis only for categories of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome while emphasizing the critical role of good oral health and regular access to dental care for all. Randomized controlled studies to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective against VGS IE are needed to further refine recommendations.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prevention and dental procedures — evidence and emphasis are summarized as follows: Although it has long been assumed that dental procedures may cause IE in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective, scientific proof is lacking to support these assumptions, and the collective published evidence suggests that an exceedingly small number of cases is caused by bacteremia-producing dental procedures; accordingly, only an extremely small number of cases of IE might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis even if it were 100 percent effective, because the vast majority of cases of IE caused by oral microflora most likely result from random bacteremias caused by routine daily activities, and the presence of dental disease may increase the risk of bacteremia associated with these routine activities; therefore, "There should be a shift in emphasis away from a focus on a dental procedure and antibiotic prophylaxis toward a greater emphasis on improved access to dental care and oral health in patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE and those conditions that predispose to the acquisition of IE".

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — other considerations for dental procedures note that 'There is no evidence that coronary artery bypass graft surgery is associated with a long-term risk for infection', therefore 'antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is not needed for patients who have undergone this surgery', and for coronary artery stents 'antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is not recommended for patients with coronary artery stents (Class III, LOE C)'. For heart transplantation, 'there are insufficient data to support specific recommendations', transplant patients are 'at risk of acquired valvular dysfunction' and IE 'is associated with a high risk of adverse outcome'; accordingly, in 'cardiac transplant recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy' the 'use of IE prophylaxis for dental procedures is reasonable, but the usefulness is not well-established (Class IIa, LOE C)'. The document also clarifies that 'the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection of joint prostheses during potentially bacteremia-inducing procedures is not within the scope of this document'.

Infective endocarditis (IE) risk from dental procedures — absolute risk estimates indicate very low event rates in the general population and across cardiac conditions: if dental treatment causes 1 percent of viridans group streptococcal IE annually, overall risk is one case per 14 million dental procedures; in patients with underlying conditions, estimated risks per procedure are MVP one per 1.1 million, CHD one per 475,000, RHD one per 142,000, presence of a prosthetic cardiac valve one per 114,000, and previous IE one per 95,000. Consistent with these estimates, only an extremely small number of cases might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis even if it were 100 percent effective.

Central Message

Guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive procedures in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need revision in the face of recurrent reports of endocarditis following these interventions.

See Article page.

Dr Lee and colleaguesreport a rare case of infective endocarditis in a 15-year-old patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The patient underwent timely surgical intervention to remove the vegetation and reduce the obstruction across the left ventricular outflow tract. The authors are to be commended for their prompt lifesaving intervention.

In this case report, the authors call attention to the fact that pediatric patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy face a risk of endocarditis much like their adult counterparts. Although this is useful information, the case report brings to the fore a much larger issue facing the medical community: a major lacuna in our understanding of infective endocarditis in patients with heart disease. In 2007, based on the paucity of evidence of benefit, the American Heart Association guidelines on antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis shifted to recommending prophylaxis for a much smaller subset of high-risk cardiac patients that did not include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Subsequent to this change in policy, there have been a multitude of reports of infective endocarditis following dental intervention in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with some even suggesting an increase. Infective endocarditis is a deadly complication with fatal consequences, and the surgical interventions entail significant risks. This case report raises the question of the utility of a blanket policy on antibiotic prophylaxis based on type of heart disease. Perhaps a more scientifically sound policy that takes into account other factors, such as severity of heart disease, vulnerability to infection, and size of the expected bacterial inoculum, among other things, is the need of the hour. As a scientific community, we need to be honest with ourselves and when there is doubt to err on the side of patient safety. The AHA committee's statement to defend the altered policy that only a small number of endocarditis might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis is poor justification, given that these infections are often lethal and involve high-risk surgical operations for treatment. Referring a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to an invasive procedure such as dental work without antibiotic prophylaxis is begging for big trouble, as this case illustrates.

Dental procedure–associated bacteremia and prophylaxis decision-making — published data indicate that the vast majority of dental office visits result in some degree of bacteremia, yet there is no evidence-based method to determine which procedures should require prophylaxis because no data show that the incidence, magnitude or duration of bacteremia from any dental procedure increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). It is also stated that no data show that visible bleeding during a dental procedure is a reliable predictor for bacteremia, and it is not clear which dental procedures are more or less likely to cause a transient bacteremia compared with routine daily activities such as chewing food, tooth brushing or flossing. In patients with underlying cardiac conditions, lifelong antibiotic therapy is not recommended to prevent IE that might result from bacteremias associated with routine daily activities.

Patients who undergo cardiac surgery — preoperative dental care: A careful dental evaluation is recommended so that required dental treatment may be completed whenever possible before cardiac valve surgery or replacement or repair of CHD, and such measures may decrease the incidence of late PVE caused by viridans group streptococci.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — historical rationale and current emphasis — Viridans group streptococci are noted to cause at least 50 per cent of community-acquired native valve IE not associated with intravenous drug use, and early work reported bacteremia related to oral hygiene and dental extraction. Okell and Elliott in 1935 reported that 11 percent of patients with poor oral hygiene had positive blood cultures with viridans group streptococci, and that 61 percent of patients had viridans group streptococcal bacteremia with dental extraction. As a result of these early and subsequent studies, during the past 50 years the AHA guidelines recommended antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients with underlying cardiac conditions who underwent bacteremia-producing procedures, yet most of these factors remain valid, but collectively they do not compensate for the lack of published data that demonstrate a benefit from prophylaxis. The large majority of published studies have focused on dental procedures as a cause of IE and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent IE in patients at risk, and few data exist on the risk of or prevention of IE associated with a GI or GU tract procedure; accordingly, the Committee undertook a critical analysis of published data in the context of the historical rationale for recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for IE before a dental procedure. Available evidence supports an emphasis on maintaining good oral hygiene and eradicating dental disease to decrease the frequency of bacteremia from routine daily activities.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

University and teaching hospital maxillofacial and dental department.

Patients

136 children with severe congenital cardiac disease attending for dental treatment between 1993 and 1998 and for whom full records were available. Each dental procedure was tallied.

Main Outcome Measures

Cumulative exposure per annum to "non-prophylaxis procedures"; cumulative exposure per annum to "prophylaxis procedures".

Results

Cumulative exposure to bacteraemia from prophylaxis procedures was not significantly greater than from non-prophylaxis procedures.

Conclusions

Dental procedure prophylaxis — cardiac conditions at highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (IE) are: prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair; previous infective endocarditis; congenital heart disease (CHD) with unrepaired cyanotic CHD, including palliative shunts and conduits; completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device, whether placed by surgery or by catheter intervention, during the first six months after the procedure; repaired CHD with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device (which inhibit endothelialization); and cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy. Except for the conditions listed above, antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for any other form of CHD, and prophylaxis is reasonable because endothelialization of prosthetic material occurs within six months after the procedure.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis: a survey of practice among pediatric cardiology providers [^0b98ef18]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2007 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines limited antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for infective endocarditis (IE) to fewer patients with predisposing cardiac conditions (PCC). We surveyed the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery (AAP SOCCS) on their recommendations for AP for a number of PCC and procedures. We report on those 173 respondents who follow the 2007 AHA guidelines. AP rates for high-risk PCCs clearly meeting AHA criteria ranged from 70.5–89.8%. Conversely, for PCCs which did not meet AHA criteria, prescribing rates varied from < 1% to 29.5%. PCC for which AP indication was unclear per guidelines, AP rates similarly varied from 9.9–39.8%. Similar variability is noted in AP for various procedures in setting of high-risk PCC. There is variability in AP prescribing practices among pediatric cardiologists based on both underlying PCC and noncardiac procedures in the setting of underlying cardiac disease.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^571af059]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

More than 80% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental procedures are unnecessary: clindamycin use, the presence of prosthetic joints, and residence in the western United States were associated with unnecessary prescribing. While antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriately prescribed for indicated dental procedures in patients with cardiac conditions, most antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed to patients in whom guideline-identified risk factors are not present. Although prescribing is slowly improving, the high proportion of antibiotics that were found to be unnecessary in our study is worrisome. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship efforts in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

### Optimizing guideline-recommended antibiotic doses for pediatric infective endocarditis [^28e727e4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association recently published an updated scientific statement on the management of infective endocarditis in childhood. The recommendations included for vancomycin, aminoglycoside, and β-lactam dosing and monitoring are based primarily on expert opinion and do not consider available evidence for dose optimization based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles in pediatric patients. This is concerning because even when clinically necessary, some practitioners may be hesitant to deviate from guideline-recommended doses. In this perspective, we highlight potential areas for improvement in the statement-recommended doses and summarize evidence supporting antibiotic dosing optimization. The addition of a pediatric clinical pharmacist with expertise in antibiotic dosing to the panel would be beneficial for future updates.

### Prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis: to use or not to use? [^8d28143d]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) published their revised guidelines in 2007 in which they markedly limited the recommendations for the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE), except for patients who are at highest risk of adverse outcomes. A recent focused update on valvular heart diseases changed the recommendation for antibiotic use for patients with many underlying heart conditions including mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which were considered as "low risk" heart defects. In this article, we argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered until concrete clinical evidence is provided to dispute against the use of this strategy, especially for patients with MVP. This approach is cost efficient, and provides a chance to prevent a dreadful disease. We have also enlisted 2 clinical cases to support our argument. These are not uncommon clinical scenarios, and emphasize that IE can be fatal in spite of optimum treatment. Patients have the right to make the final decision, and they should be allowed to participate in choosing for or against this approach until adequate clinical evidence is available.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^2f5ec3c8]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with a high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteraemia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%. Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors therefore suggest that the current focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomised placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing dental and a wide range of other invasive procedures. Although the American Heart Associationand the European Society for Cardiologychanged their guidelines around the same time, they did not recommend the complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Both continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with prosthetic heart valves undergoing invasive dental procedures, patients with cardiac valves repaired using prosthetic material, and patients with significant congenital heart lesions, a heart transplant with valvular lesions, or a history of endocarditis.

We hypothesised that by studying national prescribing data as well as data recorded for all inpatient hospital activity in the United Kingdom, we would be able to quantify the effect of the new NICE guideline on prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of infective endocarditis. We describe the effect of the guideline on the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England and the changes in the incidence of cases of infective endocarditis and deaths from the disease in hospital over that period.

### Association of amoxicillin use during early childhood with developmental Tooth enamel defects… [^6482042c]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The findings from this study suggest a link between amoxicillin use during infancy and developmental enamel defects of permanent teeth; however, further research is needed. From bivariate analyses, amoxicillin use during 3 to 6 months and cumulatively birth to 6 months and birth to 9 months were significantly associated with fluorosis. Comment The primary purpose of this study was to assess the possible relationship between early-erupting permanent tooth fluorosis and amoxicillin use during early childhood. The results show that amoxicillin use during early infancy seems to be linked to dental fluorosis on both permanent first molars and maxillary central incisors. Duration of amoxicillin use was related to the number of early-erupting permanent teeth with fluorosis.

The significantly elevated risk for dental fluorosis associated with amoxicillin use during early infancy was found at all levels of statistical analyses, even after controlling for other potential risk factors, such as fluoride intake, otitis media infections, and breastfeeding. The significance of amoxicillin use as a risk factor was supported by both the analysis on the basis of logistic regression model using the OR, and by analyses on the basis of the log-binomial regression model using the RR. Regardless of which of the 2 modeling approaches was used, the same conclusions were drawn regarding the significance of the potential explanatory variables. While the results of this one study do not warrant recommendations to cease use of amoxicillin early in life, they do further highlight the need to use antibiotics judiciously, particularly during infancy.

Moreover, new guidelines for management of acute otitis media stress that 80% of children's ear infections resolve without antibiotics with no increased risk for serious infections, 29 so that the decision for antibiotic therapy often is not justified. Further, injudicious use of antibiotics could increase risk of antibiotic resistance, and antibiotic use was recently linked to atopic disorders such as asthma30 and, although not verified, also to breast cancer in one report. 31 Therefore, antibiotic use needs special caution and justification among infants and young children because they are in the critical stages of development and growth.

### Trends in endocarditis hospitalizations at US children's hospitals: impact of the 2007 American Heart Association antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines [^550c8905]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) before dental procedures for all but those at highest risk for adverse outcomes from IE. The impact of these guidelines is unclear. We evaluated IE hospitalizations at US children's hospitals during this period.

Methods

Children < 18 years old hospitalized from 2003 to 2010 with IE at 37 centers in the Pediatric Health Information Systems Database were included. Using Poisson regression, we evaluated the number IE hospitalizations over time (raw and indexed to total hospital admissions).

Results

A total of 1157 IE cases were identified; 68% had congenital heart disease (CHD). The raw number of IE cases did not change significantly over time (+1.6% difference post vs pre guidelines, 95% CI -6.4% to +10.3%, P = 0.7). When the number of IE cases was indexed per 1,000 hospital admissions, there was a significant decline during the time period before the guidelines (annual change: -5.9%, 95% CI -9.9 to -1.8, P = 0.005) and a similar decline in the post guidelines period such that the difference between the 2 periods was not significant (P = 0.15). In subgroup analysis, no significant change over time in IE cases (raw or indexed) was found in the CHD subset, those 5 to 18 years old (subgroup most likely receiving dental care), or in cases coded as oral streptococci.

Conclusions

We found no evidence that release of new antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines was associated with a significant change in IE admissions across 37 US children's hospitals.

Risk of adverse reactions and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic therapy — nonfatal reactions (rash, diarrhea and gastrointestinal [GI] upset) occur commonly, but only single-dose therapy is recommended for dental prophylaxis and these reactions are usually not severe and self-limited; fatal anaphylaxis from penicillin was estimated at 15 to 25 per 1 million recipients, with 36 percent of fatalities in those with known allergy and 64 percent in those without a history of allergy, though these may overestimate the true risk. The American Heart Association (AHA) notes that for 50 years penicillin has been the preferred choice for dental prophylaxis for IE, and during these 50 years it is unaware of any cases reported to the AHA of fatal anaphylaxis from a penicillin recommended in its guidelines.

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^250f79a4]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The sharp fall in UK prophylactic antibiotic prescriptions in 2008 reflects a level of adherence to the guideline changes. This is consistent with the results of a survey in which 87% of UK dentists reported adherence to the NICE guidance, although 35% admitted administering antibiotic prophylaxis after the guideline change. Among cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, only 61% reported adherence. A more contemporary US survey of paediatric cardiologists found that more than half of the participants (56%) do not follow current antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. This variable, often low level of adherence, further limits the ability of the studies included in this review to provide reliable estimates of the impact of guideline changes on the incidence of IE.

Since this systematic review was completed, at least two further studies have been published aimed at determining the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis guideline changes on the incidence of IE. Similar limitations to those discussed in this review applied to both studies, one of which reported no impact of the guidelineand the other a negative impact reflected in a significant increase in streptococci-related IE cases.

Concerns that international guideline changes to recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in at-risk patients might lead to an increase in rates of IE have not been resolved by the observational studies included in this systematic review. The heterogeneity of the studies makes robust conclusions impossible particularly given their variable methodological limitations, including study size, duration of follow-up, diagnostic ascertainment, uncertainty about guideline adherence, and absence of relevant prescription and bacteriological data. Many of the studies suggested an upward trend in incident IE not obviously associated with the guideline changes and there is a clear need for onward monitoring. However, further before-and-after observational studies of the type included in this review will not be helpful in determining the impact of the antibiotic prophylaxis guideline changes without detailed clinical phenotyping of unselected registry populations at scale, with linked prescribing and bacteriological data.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing bacterial endocarditis following dental procedures [^438180dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart. It can be caused by fungi, but most often is caused by bacteria. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, which could lead to bacterial endocarditis in a small proportion of people. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis is low, but it has a high mortality rate. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that antibiotics be administered to people at high risk of endocarditis prior to invasive dental procedures. However, guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales states that antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental procedures. This is an update of a review that we first conducted in 2004 and last updated in 2013.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no antibiotic administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis, influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis. Secondary objectives To determine whether the effect of dental antibiotic prophylaxis differs in people with different cardiac conditions predisposing them to increased risk of endocarditis, and in people undergoing different high risk dental procedures. Harms Had we foundno evidence from randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness, and we had found evidence from these or case-control studies suggesting that prophylaxis with antibiotics reduced the incidence of endocarditis, then we would also have assessed whether the harms of prophylaxis with single antibiotic doses, such as with penicillin (amoxicillin 2 g or 3 g) before invasive dental procedures, compared with no antibiotic or placebo, equalled the benefits in prevention of endocarditis in people at high risk of this disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 10 May 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies SELECTION CRITERIA: Due to the low incidence of bacterial endocarditis, we anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, we included cohort and case-control studies with suitably matched control or comparison groups. The intervention was antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. Cohort studies would need to follow at-risk individuals and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping participants according to whether or not they had received prophylaxis. Case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis after undergoing an invasive dental procedure (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing the procedure) with those at similar risk who had not developed endocarditis. Our outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse effects of the antibiotics; and the cost of antibiotic provision compared to that of caring for patients who developed endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search records, selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the included study and extracted data from the included study. As an author team, we judged the certainty of the evidence identified for the main comparison and key outcomes using GRADE criteria. We presented the main results in a summary of findings table.

Main Results

Our new search did not find any new studies for inclusion since the last version of the review in 2013. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included in the previous versions of the review, but one case-control study met the inclusion criteria. The trial authors collected information on 48 people who had contracted bacterial endocarditis over a specific two-year period and had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted bacterial endocarditis. All study participants had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared to establish whether those who had received preventive antibiotics (penicillin) were less likely to have developed endocarditis. The authors found no significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis. No data on other outcomes were reported. The level of certainty we have about the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no clear evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in at-risk people who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. We cannot determine whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners should discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

Infective endocarditis (IE) and dental procedures — temporal patterns and attribution are described as follows: studies suggest the interval between bacteremia and IE symptoms is usually seven to 14 days, with 78 percent occurring within seven days and 85 percent within 14 days; many attributed cases involved a dental procedure three to six months before IE, and incubation longer than two weeks after a dental procedure was likely attributed incorrectly. Bacteremia-producing dental procedures are common, with at least 50 percent of the U.S. population visiting a dentist at least once a year.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of penicillin V should be determined according to the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms and the severity of infection, and adjusted to the clinical response of the patient.

The usual dosage recommendations for adults and children 12 years and over are as follows:

Streptococcal Infections

Mild to moderately severe – of the upper respiratory tract and including scarlet fever and erysipelas: 125 to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours for 10 days.

Pneumococcal Infections

Mild to moderately severe – of the respiratory tract, including otitis media: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 hours until the patient has been afebrile for at least 2 days.

Staphylococcal Infections

Mild infections of skin and soft tissue (culture and sensitive tests should be performed): 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

Fusospirochetosis (Vincent's infection)

of the oropharynx. Mild to moderately severe infections: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea: 125 to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) twice daily on a continuing basis.

For prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis1 in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when undergoing dental procedures or surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract: 2 gram of penicillin V (1 gram for children under 60 lbs.) 1 hour before the procedure, and then, 1 gram (500 mg for children under 60 lbs.) 6 hours later.

### Perspectives on the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^5502afe3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement dramatically changing its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated in an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease. The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift with regard to which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of IE and for what procedures. The shift in recommendations is striking in that the recommendations are based not on new data, but on no data. (There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis.) However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis. Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio. On an individual basis, patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention have something very real to risk if they develop IE, and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

- prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repairs, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips

- previous IE

- unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease, with residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^71776653]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) is controversial. In recent years, guidelines to cardiologists and dentists have advised restriction of AP to high-risk groups (in Europe and the USA) or against its use at all (in the UK). The objective of this systematic review was to appraise the evidence for use of AP for prevention of bacteraemia or IE in patients undergoing dental procedures.

Methods

We conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and ISI Web of Science. We assessed the methodological characteristics of included studies using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for trials. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies, assessed the methodology of included studies and extracted the data.

Results

We identified 178 eligible studies, of which 36 were included in the review. This included 10 time-trend studies, 5 observational studies and 21 trials. All trials identified used bacteraemia as an endpoint rather than IE. One time-trend study suggests that total AP restriction may be associated with a rising incidence of IE, while data on the consequences of relative AP restriction are conflicting. Meta-analysis of trials indicates that AP is effective in reducing the incidence of bacteraemia (risk ratio 0.53, 95%CI 0.49 to 0.57, p < 0.01), but case-control studies suggest this may not translate to a statistically significant protective effect against IE in patients at low risk of disease.

Conclusions

The evidence base for the use of AP is limited, heterogeneous and the methodological quality of many studies is poor. Postprocedural bacteraemia is not a good surrogate endpoint for IE. Given the logistical challenges of a randomised trial, high-quality case-control studies would help to evaluate the role of dental procedures in causing IE and the efficacy of AP in its prevention.

### Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis use in children's hospitals… [^70a5c7e9]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Receipt of surgical AP. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes included procedure- and hospital-specific rates of AP use and appropriateness of use based on clinical guidelines and consensus statements. We also assessed rates of Clostridium difficile infection and potential allergic reactions after AP receipt. We examined the occurrence of 2 specific adverse drug events potentially associated with AP: CDI and allergic reactions. C difficile infection associated with AP was captured by identifying patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code for CDI within 30 days after the index procedure. This diagnostic code has been shown to reliably and accurately identify children with CDI. 21 Receipt of diphenhydramine or epinephrine by any route on the day of surgery was identified as a surrogate for the potential presence of an allergic reaction.

The median procedure-specific AP utilization rate was 78. 1%, ranging from a low of
11. 5% of cases receiving AP for laryngeal procedures to a high of 100% for ventriculostomy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and spinal cord procedures. The procedures with the greatest variability by hospital for AP use included chordee repair, uretheral meatoplasty, and circumcision. Clostridium difficile infection was documented in 46 of 671 255 cases within 30 days after surgery. Children who received AP had significantly higher odds of developing CDI. Diphenhydramine was administered after surgery in 7292 of 671 255 cases and epinephrine was administered in 26 199 of 671 255 cases; children who received AP had significantly higher odds of receiving these medications. The importance of proper AP use cannot be overemphasized because appropriate use of AP is associated with decreased incidence of SSI after a variety of operations.

18, 20 However, antibiotics are one of the most common medication classes associated with potential adverse drug events in children, 33 and studies have demonstrated that CDI can occur after exposure to perioperative AP. 11, 17, 34, 35 In this study, we found that across a wide spectrum of pediatric surgical procedures, administration of AP was associated with both CDI and proxy measures of potential allergic reaction after surgery. Further studies should assess adverse drug reactions related to AP use in more detail.

### A not very NICE case of endocarditis [^236e28cf]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 69-year-old man, previously independent and with a pre-existing metallic aortic valve, presented with a history of fevers, confusion and malaise and was diagnosed with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Blood cultures taken on presentation grew Streptococcus sanguinis and vegetations were confirmed on transoesophageal echocardiogram. He had had a dental procedure 10 days before presentation but had not received prophylactic antibiotics; he had been receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment up until the change in NICE guidelines in 2008. He was treated with high dose antibiotics and was referred for cardiothoracic surgery, but developed a cerebrovascular event, thought to be embolic, and deteriorated and died. Given that the patient had a metallic aortic valve and poor dentition, and therefore was at increased risk of infective endocarditis, should the new guidelines have been followed so rigidly, particularly as American and European guidelines still recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in this patient group?

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^19ad56ec]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe disease with an in-hospital mortality rate of about 20% and a five year mortality rate of 40%. This disease is also associated with high morbidity and a high cost burden, as the treatment of infective endocarditis requires prolonged hospital stay, and one out of two patients undergoes valve surgery during the acute phase of the disease. Strategies for antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis have been proposed for many years for patients with heart disease at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing invasive procedures responsible for bacteraemia, despite the lack of proof of efficacy: neither randomised clinical trials (providing the highest level of evidence) nor cohorts studies have been conducted to support an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy. Over the past three decades five case-control studies have been conducted; only two of them established an association between dental procedures and streptococcal infective endocarditis and none of them was sufficiently powered to establish the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis.

In addition to the lack of scientific evidence of efficacy for an antibiotic prophylaxis strategy, statistical modelling showed that "everyday low level bacteraemia" that occurs after tooth brushing, flossing, or chewing (and not covered by antibiotic prophylaxis) may more frequently trigger oral streptococcal infective endocarditis bacteraemia than invasive dental procedures. On the basis of these hypotheses, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis have been restricted to two different strategies in all guidelines over the past decade. The 2007 USand 2009/2015 European guidelinesrecommend antibiotic prophylaxis only in patients with prosthetic heart valves, a history of infective endocarditis, or congenital cyanotic heart disease undergoing invasive dental procedures, whereas the UK 2008 NICE guidelinesrecommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be withheld from all patients for all procedures.

However, a trend towards an increased incidence of infective endocarditis has been reported in some studies from the US and Germany after implementation of the 2007–09 guidelines and in the UK after the 2008 NICE guidelines, highlighting the possible role of invasive dental procedures in the development of infective endocarditis. In the UK this increased incidence, reported in 2015 in various patient groups, was observed in those with prosthetic heart valves who no longer received antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures. Despite discordant findings from other studiesthese results raised the question of whether the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis may be broadened again. Although NICE guidelines were not modified immediately following this publication, the 2016 guidelines clearly specified that "antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate in individual cases".

HEPATIC DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS Cirrhosis is associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A dental assessment and treatment are critical in preparing patients with cirrhosis for liver transplantation by optimizing oral health and minimizing the risk of oral infections. 25, 29 The traditional practice of performing a perioperative platelet transfusion for patients with platelet counts below 50 × 10. The preferred analgesic for patients with dental pain and compensated hepatic dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol is acetaminophen, sometimes limited to 2 g per day. 27, 28 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, except aspirin when prescribed for cardiovascular disease, are usually avoided because of platelet, kidney, and gastric risks. 28, 29.

OSTEOPOROSIS Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious complication associated with the use of bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive agents or antiangiogenic cancer treatments. 9, 30 A history of exposure to these drugs can increase the patient's lifetime risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw by up to 100-fold, depending on the treatment regimen and indication for which it was prescribed. 9 Dental extraction and implant procedures are known to trigger osteonecrosis; therefore, the dentist may need to modify the care plan in these patients.
30. Table 3, details such as drug name, dosage, route of administration, indication, and treatment duration should be communicated to the dentist. 9, 30 Patients should optimize their oral health before initiating bisphosphonates if possible. 30 For those already taking bisphosphonates, current literature has not shown a benefit to discontinuing the treatment perioperatively.

PAIN AND NARCOTICS Studies show that multimodal analgesia is more effective than monomodal analgesia in the management of acute dental pain; combining acetaminophen with NSAIDs is highly effective. 35, 36 Despite a declining trend, opioids are often prescribed for dental pain. 46 Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain; therefore, the risks of opioid addiction, including death, should be discussed with patients considering opioids. 37–39.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid atresia/single ventricle — infections: infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis recommendations include the following. CLASS I: "Antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa is reasonable in those patients with the following indications" including prosthetic cardiac valve, previous IE, unrepaired and palliated cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) including surgically constructed palliative shunts and conduits, completely repaired CHD with prosthetic materials placed by surgery or catheter intervention during the first 6 months after the procedure, and repaired CHD with residual defects at or adjacent to a prosthetic patch or device that inhibit endothelialization. It is further stated that "It is reasonable to consider antibiotic prophylaxis against IE before vaginal delivery at the time of membrane rupture in select patients with the highest risk of adverse outcomes", including those with prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair and those with unrepaired and palliated cyanotic CHD including surgically constructed palliative shunts and conduits. CLASS III: "Prophylaxis against IE is not recommended for nondental procedures (such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy) in the absence of active infection".

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^9f3b6143]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Antibiotics are recommended before certain dental procedures in patients with select comorbidities to prevent serious distant site infections.

Objective

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures using Truven, a national integrated health claims database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study. Dental visits from 2011 to 2015 were linked to medical and prescription claims from 2009 to 2015. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Participants were US patients with commercial dental insurance without a hospitalization or extraoral infection 14 days before antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as a prescription with ≤ 2 days' supply dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit).

Exposures

Presence or absence of cardiac diagnoses and dental procedures that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis. To assess associations between patient or dental visit characteristics and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, multivariable logistic regression was used. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with an α level of .05.

Results

From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed for 168 420 dental visits for 91 438 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 55–72 years; 57.2% female). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most dental visits were classified as diagnostic (70.2%) and/or preventive (58.8%). In 90.7% of dental visits, a procedure was performed that would necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk cardiac patients. Prevalent comorbidities include prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Per guidelines, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were unnecessary. Clindamycin was more likely to be unnecessary relative to amoxicillin (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15). Prosthetic joint devices (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41), tooth implant procedures (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), female sex (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25), and visits occurring in the western United States (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) were associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis.

Conclusion and Relevance

More than 80% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: a national cohort study [^5b56817a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

The present study was a nationwide cohort study conducted using Swedish health registers. Record linkage was achieved because of the Swedish national registration number assigned to every citizen has been used since 1947. The study is reported according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

Study Population

The study population consisted of two cohorts, one at high risk of IE because of prior IE, a prosthetic heart valve, or cyanotic congenital heart disease, and a reference cohort at low risk of IE not eligible for AP. Table 1 and Table 2 describe the high-risk cohort. The low-risk cohort was included to calculate and compare hazard rate ratios (HRRs) for IE before and after the change in recommendations. Figure 1 is a flow chart describing the inclusion of individuals in the study.

Figure 1.
Flow chart describing of the inclusion of individuals. Those who underwent heart valve surgery before or during infective endocarditis (IE) hospitalization were included in the prior IE group. Individuals diagnosed with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) after implantation of a prosthetic heart valve, or after hospitalization because of IE, were categorized as patients with a prosthetic heart valve or as patients with prior IE. ∗The reference cohort consisted of individuals with no previous heart disease. Index = start of follow-up.

The high-risk cohort consisted of adult individuals (> 17 years of age) living in Sweden during the 10-year study period (January 2008–January 2018), with a main or secondary International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code or a surgical procedure code indicating high risk of IE (Table 3). To identify high-risk individuals, data were collected on all inpatient episodes with the relevant ICD and surgical procedure codes (Table 3) in the National Patient Register (NPR) and the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) since 1964 and 1973, respectively. Children and adolescents younger than age 17 years were not included, as they are treated at pediatric clinics not reporting to the SRIE.

Codes for Inclusion of High-risk Individuals

The reference cohort consisted of adult low-risk individuals with diabetes, and no medical history of heart disease, hemodialysis, pacemaker, heart transplant, rheumatic fever, or drug use (Z86.4, Z72.2, R78.1–R78.6) before study entry according to NPR or MBR records. The reference cohort was selected to represent individuals with relatively low risk of IE not affected by the change in recommendations of AP.

It further states "The 1997 document was notable for its acknowledgment that most cases of IE are not attributable to an invasive procedure but rather are the result of randomly occurring bacteremias from routine daily activities and for acknowledging possible IE prophylaxis failures". The rationale section emphasizes that "the AHA guidelines for IE prophylaxis have been in a process of evolution for more than 50 years" and that "The rationale for prophylaxis was based largely on expert opinion and what seemed to be a rational and prudent attempt to prevent a life-threatening infection".

General pediatric antibiotic dosing — In adult patients, drug doses are standardized; however, in children, drugs are prescribed based on the patient's age, weight, body surface area, and/or clinical condition. For pediatric antibiotic regimens, doses are usually weight-based, and therefore careful calculation is required to ensure correct dosage. Pediatric patients therefore are at a higher risk than adults for experiencing the effects of dosing errors; this may result in subtherapeutic antibiotic dosing causing treatment failure and the emergence of resistant organisms or supratherapeutic dosing and toxicity. Many institutions performing pediatric interventional procedures have an antibiotic dosing standardization that minimizes the risk of calculation errors and reduces the time required for dose calculation by the prescriber.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^9b5c8711]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Dentists prescribe 1 in 10 antibiotic prescriptions and are the top specialty prescriber of antibiotics in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing by dentists is common, comprising almost 60% of prescriptions to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. While decreases in prescribing of antibiotics have been observed nationally, dental prescribing has remained steady. This is despite changes in clinical guidelines narrowing the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.,

Prior infection prophylaxis guidelines recommended that patients with certain conditions (ie, patients with recent prosthetic joint implants) receive antibiotic prophylaxis before a dentist visit. The rationale for prophylaxis was that patients with these conditions have an increased risk for serious distant site infections (eg, infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections) secondary to bacteremia introduced during dental care. However, guidelines for the use of antibiotics for the prevention of infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections were revised in 2007 and 2013, respectively. The rationale for these revisions was secondary to poor evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis, lack of an association between endocarditis and joint infections and dental care, and the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events. Antibiotic resistance, risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and general adverse effects outweigh any potential benefit, which is likely to be small. Therefore, antibiotics before dental procedures are only recommended per guidelines in patients with cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis undergoing invasive dental procedures.

While studies in outpatient primary medical care settings have demonstrated that 30% of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary, no study has evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing by dentists. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.

Outpatient care of children with pulmonary hypertension (PH) — guideline recommendations are as follows: Children with PH should be evaluated and treated in comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinics at specialized pediatric centers (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Outpatient follow-up visits at 3- to 6-month intervals are reasonable, with more frequent visits for patients with advanced disease or after initiation or changes in therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Preventive care measures for health maintenance are recommended for pediatric patients with PH, including respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis (if eligible), influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, rigorous monitoring of growth parameters, prompt recognition and treatment of infectious respiratory illnesses, and antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of subacute bacterial endocarditis in cyanotic patients and those with indwelling central lines (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Careful preoperative planning, consultation with cardiac anesthesia, and plans for appropriate postprocedural monitoring are recommended for pediatric patients with PH undergoing surgery or other interventions (Class I; Level of Evidence C), and elective surgery for patients with pediatric PH should be performed at hospitals with expertise in PH and in consultation with the pediatric PH service and anesthesiologists with experience in the perioperative management of children with PH (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Because of the significant maternal and fetal mortality associated with pregnancy in patients with PH, it is recommended that female adolescents with PH be provided age-appropriate counseling about pregnancy risks and options for contraception (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Because of the risks of syncope or sudden death with exertion, it is recommended that a thorough evaluation, including CPET and treatment, be performed before the patient engages in athletic (symptom-limited) activity (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Pediatric patients with severe PH (WHO functional class III or IV) or a recent history of syncope should not participate in competitive sports (Class III; Level of Evidence C). During exercise, it is recommended that pediatric patients with PH engage in light to moderate aerobic activity, avoid strenuous and isometric exertion, remain well hydrated, and be allowed to self-limit as required (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

### Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: current tendencies, continuing controversies [^8770da01]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe disease with high mortality, and results most often from the combination of bacteraemia (sometimes provoked) and a predisposing cardiac condition. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis has been recommended by different countries on the basis of the supposed pathophysiology of the disease, although no randomised clinical trial has confirmed its efficacy. We review the data presented over the past few decades, challenge the principles underlying prophylaxis recommendations, and analyse the arguments that explain the general tendency in very recent years to decrease prophylaxis indications. Such arguments include the probable important role of everyday-life bacteraemia in the occurrence of infective endocarditis, the estimated huge number of prophylaxis doses to be given to avoid a single case of infective endocarditis, and the lack of scientific evidence to identify those procedures that should lead to prophylaxis. Recommendations for prophylaxis are now essentially focused on patients with high-risk predisposing cardiac conditions before dental procedures.

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^2cb2b1d8]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 3–10 cases per 100 000 per year. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, prognosis remains poor, as reflected by hospital mortality of about 22%, rising to 40% at 5 years. Morbidity rates are also high; 50% of patients require operative management in the acute phase of the disease, often with ongoing consequences for quality of life. The substantial risk associated with IE has driven recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups, particularly those with valvular heart disease and other structural cardiac disorders.

Ever since the 1950s when the large-scale commercial production of penicillin was established, the American Heart Association (AHA) has advocated antibiotic prophylaxis in subgroups of patients undergoing invasive procedures, including dental extraction and certain gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures, that are likely to cause secondary bacteraemia. Secondary bacteraemia in relation to these procedures is well documented but a causal relationship with IE has never been established in randomised trials or case–control studies. Despite this, antibiotic prophylaxis has remained a central component of management in at-risk individuals for over 50 years.

In 2002, innovative guidelines in France challenged accepted practice by suggesting restriction of prophylaxis against IE to patients with the highest ratio of benefit to individual and collective risk while emphasising the importance of general and oral hygiene in populations at risk. In 2007, the AHA — followed in 2009 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) — withdrew recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in all but the highest risk individuals such as those with previous IE, prosthetic heart valves or immunodeficiency disorders. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made the yet more radical recommendation for complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in all individuals regardless of risk. These new guideline recommendations, summarised in table 1, broke with a long-established principle of care and caused deep concern among many clinicians who cited historical, often small studies in questioning whether the recommendation was evidence based and whether it was safe for patients.NICE was unrepentant arguing that the absence of an evidence base was precisely why the need for antibiotic prophylaxis had been questioned and that the harms of anaphylaxis through wide-scale application of antibiotic prophylaxis were likely to exceed any potential benefits of IE prevention.
