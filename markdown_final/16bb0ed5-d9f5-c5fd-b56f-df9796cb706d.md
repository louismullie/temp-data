## Question

Work up for 8 yo female with abdominal pain and headaches for 4 days

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for an 8-year-old girl with 4 days of abdominal pain and headaches. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis. Next, I will outline the focused history and physical examination. After that, I need to define the initial laboratory and imaging strategy. Finally, I will consider management pathways, follow-up, and when to escalate care, ensuring each step is evidence-linked and internally consistent.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities and red flags, because missing a serious condition in a child with abdominal pain and headache would be unacceptable. I need to check for fever, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, papilledema, projectile vomiting, peritoneal signs, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or bleeding, as these features push me toward urgent evaluation and possible neuroimaging or surgical consultation [^21af8865] [^73e94ef0] [^9985c86c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should build a prioritized differential that spans surgical, medical, neurologic, infectious, metabolic, and functional etiologies. In children, functional abdominal pain is common, but I must not anchor prematurely on that diagnosis without excluding organic disease, especially when headache coexists, which broadens the neurologic differential and raises concern for intracranial processes even if the baseline risk is low [^e54cc008] [^73e94ef0].

> I will now examine the history elements I must elicit with precision, because the history drives the pretest probabilities. I need to characterize the abdominal pain by location, quality, severity, periodicity, relation to meals, associated GI symptoms, and nocturnal awakening; for the headache, I should confirm location, quality, severity, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, aura, timing relative to abdominal pain, and any nocturnal or morning predominance; I should also ask about fever, weight change, travel, sick contacts, animal exposures, trauma, medication use, and family history of migraine or GI disease, since these can pivot the workup toward infection, migraine spectrum disorders, or functional disease [^e54cc008] [^05cd063d] [^5025bef8].

> Wait, let me verify the physical examination priorities so I do not miss key signs. I need to check vitals for fever, tachycardia, or hypertension; perform a careful abdominal exam for tenderness, guarding, rebound, masses, or organomegaly; and complete a focused neurologic exam including fundoscopy for papilledema, cranial nerves, strength, coordination, and gait, because papilledema or focal deficits mandate urgent neuroimaging and neurosurgical involvement [^73e94ef0] [^9985c86c].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory strategy, keeping it targeted to the pretest probability. A reasonable first pass includes CBC with differential, ESR and/or CRP, basic metabolic panel, liver enzymes, urinalysis, and stool testing if diarrhea or travel risk is present; I should add specific tests only if the history directs me, such as EBV serology for fever and adenopathy, or celiac serology for diarrhea, weight loss, or growth issues, because indiscriminate panels add little value and increase false positives [^ca81ec2a] [^27e5841b] [^e8be4861].

> I need to ensure the imaging plan is judicious and aligned with risk. In a stable child without red flags, right lower quadrant ultrasound is appropriate to evaluate for appendicitis or mesenteric adenitis; if headache red flags are present, brain MRI is indicated; if fever and adenopathy coexist, abdominal ultrasound can assess for hepatosplenomegaly; I should avoid routine CT unless the diagnosis remains unclear and the result will change management, given radiation risks in children [^9985c86c] [^73e94ef0] [^0035915f].

> Let me consider the most likely diagnosis first, but I should double-check that I am not anchoring. Functional abdominal pain is common in children and can coexist with headache, but I should confirm the absence of alarm features and ensure that the pain pattern fits Rome criteria before labeling it functional; if the headache is migrainous and the abdominal pain is episodic, severe, periumbilical, and associated with vasomotor symptoms, abdominal migraine becomes more likely, especially with a family history of migraine [^e54cc008] [^05cd063d] [^6a608a82].

> But wait, what if the vomiting predominates and the pain is less prominent. Cyclic vomiting syndrome can mimic abdominal migraine and is more likely when intense, stereotyped vomiting episodes occur with intervening wellness; I should confirm discrete episodes, absence of organic findings, and consider that CVS and abdominal migraine share migraine biology and can evolve into classic migraine over time [^c5e0ec57] [^3461966f] [^59b088f5].

> I should confirm that I am not missing infection. Viral illnesses like EBV can present with fever, abdominal pain, headache, and hepatosplenomegaly; in children with travel or epidemiologic risk, I need to consider arboviruses such as dengue or chikungunya, which can cause fever, headache, and abdominal pain; and in the right context, I should remember that Dientamoeba fragilis can cause abdominal pain and may be underrecognized, though it is not typically associated with headache [^e8be4861] [^5025bef8] [^7e8ed152].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking neurologic emergencies. Although rare, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and other intracranial processes can present with headache and abdominal pain; new-onset persistent headaches, especially with vomiting, visual changes, or neurologic deficits, warrant brain MRI and urgent neurology input, even if the baseline prevalence is low [^85b54025] [^73e94ef0].

> Let me reconsider metabolic and genetic conditions if the history suggests. Acute intermittent porphyria is rare in children but can present with severe abdominal pain, headache, seizures, and neuropathy; ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can present with recurrent abdominal pain and encephalopathy; and hereditary angioedema can cause recurrent severe abdominal pain with complete resolution between attacks, often misdiagnosed for years, so I should ask about cutaneous swelling and family history if episodes recur [^46a1f08d] [^07e09c13] [^0c49de00].

> I should double-check that my management plan aligns with the most likely diagnosis and current guidance. If no red flags are present and the presentation fits functional abdominal pain, reassurance, education, and a biopsychosocial approach are first-line; if abdominal migraine is suspected, I can consider migraine-directed strategies and, for recurrent disabling episodes, discuss prophylaxis; if CVS is suspected, I should follow consensus guidance on acute and preventive management; if any red flags emerge, I should escalate to urgent imaging, subspecialty referral, or inpatient observation as indicated [^e54cc008] [^05cd063d] [^c5e0ec57] [^3461966f].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting, because missed serious disease is the key risk. I will arrange close follow-up within 24 to 48 hours to reassess symptoms, vitals, and exam; I will provide clear return precautions for fever, persistent vomiting, severe headache, visual changes, weight loss, or new neurologic symptoms; and I will document the rationale for deferring imaging or invasive testing so that subsequent clinicians understand the decision-making trajectory [^73e94ef0] [^e54cc008].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: screen for red flags, elicit a meticulous history, perform a focused exam, order targeted labs and imaging based on risk, consider functional and migraine-spectrum diagnoses when appropriate, and maintain vigilance for infection, neurologic, and metabolic causes. This balances the high likelihood of benign functional disease with the imperative not to miss serious pathology in an 8-year-old with 4 days of abdominal pain and headache [^e54cc008] [^05cd063d] [^73e94ef0].

---

For an 8-year-old girl with 4 days of abdominal pain and headache, the workup should be **guided by red flags** and the **most likely diagnoses**. Start with a focused history and exam to identify alarm features, then order targeted labs (CBC, CMP, ESR/CRP, urinalysis) and consider abdominal ultrasound if pain is persistent or localized. If red flags are present (fever, weight loss, neurologic deficits, papilledema, or focal findings), escalate to CT/MRI or lumbar puncture. Most cases are benign (viral, functional, or abdominal migraine), but **exclude appendicitis, UTI, constipation, and migraine** before labeling as functional.

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough history and physical examination are essential to guide the diagnostic workup. Key elements include:

- **Pain characteristics**: Location, intensity, quality, duration, periodicity, relation to meals, activity, and bowel movements.
- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, weight loss, dysuria, frequency, urgency, rash, joint pain, or swelling.
- **Headache features**: Location, intensity, duration, frequency, associated photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, or neurologic symptoms.
- **Family history**: Migraine, gastrointestinal disorders, or autoimmune diseases.
- **Social history**: Recent travel, sick contacts, dietary changes, stressors, or trauma.
- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, general appearance, abdominal examination (tenderness, guarding, rebound, masses, organomegaly), neurologic examination (cranial nerves, motor strength, coordination, reflexes), and skin examination (rash, bruising, petechiae).

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for abdominal pain and headache in an 8-year-old female includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Viral gastroenteritis <br/> - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Streptococcal pharyngitis <br/> - Epstein-Barr virus <br/> - Meningitis/encephalitis |
| Gastrointestinal | - Constipation <br/> - Functional abdominal pain <br/> - Irritable bowel syndrome <br/> - Celiac disease <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Appendicitis <br/> - Mesenteric adenitis <br/> - Intussusception <br/> - Hernia <br/> - Gallstones |
| Neurologic | - Migraine <br/> - Abdominal migraine <br/> - Tension headache <br/> - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension <br/> - Brain tumor <br/> - Encephalitis <br/> - Meningitis |
| Metabolic/endocrine | - Diabetic ketoacidosis <br/> - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances |
| Hematologic | - Sickle cell disease <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Lymphoma |
| Rheumatologic | - Henoch-Schönlein purpura <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus |
| Psychiatric | - Anxiety <br/> - Depression <br/> - Somatic symptom disorder |

---

## Initial diagnostic workup

Based on the clinical presentation, the following initial diagnostic tests are recommended:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for infection, anemia, or hematologic disorders.
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and glucose.
- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Screen for inflammation or infection.
- **Urinalysis**: Evaluate for urinary tract infection or renal involvement.
- **Stool studies**: If diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms are present, consider stool culture, ova and parasites, or fecal calprotectin.
- **Abdominal ultrasound**: If pain is persistent, localized, or if organomegaly is suspected.

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

Further diagnostic testing is indicated if any of the following red flags or concerning features are present:

- **Persistent fever**: Temperature > 38°C lasting more than 5 days.
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss or failure to thrive.
- **Neurologic symptoms**: Seizures, altered mental status, focal deficits, papilledema, or severe headache with vomiting.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.
- **Severe or progressive abdominal pain**: Especially if localized to the right lower quadrant (suggesting appendicitis).
- **Signs of systemic illness**: Rash, joint swelling, or lymphadenopathy.

If red flags are present, consider the following additional tests:

- **Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis**: Evaluate for appendicitis, intra-abdominal abscess, or malignancy.
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain**: Evaluate for intracranial pathology, such as tumor, encephalitis, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
- **Lumbar puncture**: Evaluate for meningitis or encephalitis if neurologic symptoms are present.
- **Endoscopy**: Evaluate for inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other gastrointestinal disorders if symptoms persist or if red flags are present.

---

## Management and follow-up

Management depends on the underlying diagnosis. For benign functional abdominal pain or migraine, provide reassurance, dietary modifications, and symptomatic treatment. For organic pathology, manage according to the specific diagnosis. Follow-up should be arranged within 1–2 weeks to reassess symptoms and ensure improvement.

---

A structured approach to an 8-year-old female with abdominal pain and headache includes a focused history and physical examination, initial laboratory tests, and selective imaging. Further testing is guided by red flags and the most likely diagnoses, with management tailored to the underlying cause.

Background

Abdominal migraine is a diagnostically challenging childhood disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, which has not been clearly demonstrated to occur in adults.

Methods

We used 2 sets of consensus criteria for the diagnosis of abdominal migraine in children to evaluate adults suspected of having this condition in both our own patient population and in the medical literature. Two patients in our clinic and 11 patients from the medical literature composed our initial study cohort and were analyzed using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2(nd) Edition and American College of Gastroenterology Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for abdominal migraine in children.

Results

Ten of these patients met inclusion criteria for definite or probable abdominal migraine and comprised our final study cohort. The 10 patients from this adult cohort shared common demographic and clinical characteristics with children suffering from abdominal migraine, including a familial history of migraine in 90%.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that abdominal migraine occurs and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain in adults, especially if there is a family history of migraine headaches.

### Abdominal migraine in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain [^996626d2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although traditionally regarded as a specific pediatric disease, abdominal migraine may also be observed in adults. Unfortunately, however, this condition is frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in the emergency department (ED). A 30-year-old woman presented to our ED complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting, lasting for 12 hours. The pain was periumbilical, continuous, and not associated with fever or diarrhea. The physical examination and the results of conventional blood tests were normal. The patient was treated with intravenous ketoprofen, metoclopramide, and ranitidine, obtaining a prompt relief of symptoms. She had a history of similar episodes in the last 15 years, with several ED visits, blood test examinations, ultrasonography of the abdomen, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Celiac disease, porphyry, sickle cell disease, and inflammatory bowel disease were all excluded. In July 2012, she became pregnant, and she delivered a healthy baby on April 2013. Until November 2014, she has remained asymptomatic. Based on the clinical characteristics of the abdominal pain episodes, the exclusion of any alternative diagnosis, and the relief of symptoms during and after pregnancy, a final diagnosis of abdominal migraine could be established. A skilled emergency physician should always consider abdominal migraine in the differential diagnosis of patients admitted to the ED with abdominal pain, especially when the attacks are recurrent and no alternative diagnosis can be clearly established.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### Abdominal migraine [^6a608a82]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal migraine (AM) is a syndrome usually recognised in childhood. The syndrome is characterised by episodic attacks of severe abdominal pain and vasomotor symptoms, nausea and vomiting. It is a poorly understood disorder largely due to a limited recognition of this condition by the medical community. However, the publication of AM diagnostic guidelines by the International Headache Society a decade ago and the recognition of AM in the Rome Classification of functional gastrointestinal disorders have helped to legitimise this disorder and facilitate research.

Overview

AM is relatively common, affecting up to 4% of the paediatric population. Whilst AM is not believed to continue into adulthood for the majority of children, it has the propensity to develop into probable migraine and recurrent abdominal pain in adulthood. The pathophysiology of this condition remains unclear and as a result treatment for this condition is suboptimal with avoidance of triggers and prophylactic treatment currently recommended when an episode begins.

Conclusion

The recognition of AM by the IHS and the Rome Foundation should help facilitate future research into the pathophysiology of this debilitating condition and as a result better treatments for AM should emerge. Randomised controlled trials should be a priority.

### Adult abdominal migraine: a new syndrome or sporadic feature of migraine headache? A case report [^6b3aa217]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Abdominal migraine is one of the variants of migraine headache typically occurring in children and coded as 1.3.2 in the revised edition of IHS classification within the group 'Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine'. The affected children frequently develop typical migraine later in their life. We report a case of a 23 years old woman affected by attacks of recurrent abdominal pain accompanied by migraine. Abdominal pain attacks started in the adolescence and persisted without headache until the patient was 21. At this time, she experienced migraine pain accompanied by nausea, photophobia and phonophobia and associated to acute abdominal pain. Neuroimaging investigations and laboratory testing excluded any underlying organic disease. Complete remission of abdominal attacks was obtained during 4-month treatment period with pizotifen. Attacks fulfil IHS diagnostic criteria for 'abdominal migraine', although of late onset. This case report suggests that 'abdominal migraine' is a migraineous disorder to be hypothesized in adult patients after having disclosed any organic disease. As reported in the literature, 'adult abdominal migraine' is a sporadic migraine subtype in adult patients and it is not to be considered as a new migraineous syndrome.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease. Lymphoma would be the most likely malignancy given her age and constitutional symptoms.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^41101443]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Patients with undiagnosed HAE with GI symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe and often recurrent abdominal pain, with or without skin manifestations, may improve the diagnosis rate of HAE. Careful history-taking and a physical examination along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^d615127a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis.

### Serious diagnoses for headaches after ED discharge [^73e94ef0]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Headache is a common complaint among children presenting to the emergency department (ED) and can be due to serious neurologic and nonneurologic diagnoses (SNNDs). We sought to characterize the children discharged from the ED with headache found to have SNNDs at revisits.

Methods

We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study using data from 45 pediatric hospitals from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2019. We included pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) discharged from the ED with a principal diagnosis of headache, excluding patients with concurrent or previous SNNDs or neurosurgeries. We identified rates and types of SNNDs diagnosed within 30 days of initial visit and compared these rates with those of control groups defined as patients with discharge diagnoses of cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, and soft tissue complaints.

Results

Of 121621 included patients (57% female, median age 12.4 years, interquartile range: 8.8–15.4), 608 (0.5%, 95% confidence interval: 0.5%-0.5%) were diagnosed with SNNDs within 30 days. Most were diagnosed at the first revisit (80.8%); 37.5% were diagnosed within 7 days. The most common SNNDs were benign intracranial hypertension, cerebral edema and compression, and seizures. A greater proportion of patients with SNNDs underwent neuroimaging, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid testing compared with those without SNNDs (P < .001 for each). The proportion of SNNDs among patients diagnosed with headache (0.5%) was higher than for control cohorts (0.0%-0.1%) (P < .001 for each).

Conclusions

A total 0.5% of pediatric patients discharged from the ED with headache were diagnosed with an SNND within 30 days. Further efforts to identify at-risk patients remain a challenge.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 16-year-old female presented with a four-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, headache, myalgias and cough. Her initial vital signs in the referring emergency department were temperature 39.4° Celsius, pulse 154, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 115/61, and oxygen saturation 96%. Physical examination was notable for pallor and right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound. Initial laboratory testing significant for white blood cell (WBC) count 5.8 10³/uL (reference range 4–10.5) with 93% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL (12–15), platelets 102 10³/uL (150–450), C-reactive protein 11 mg/dL (0–1.0), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 26 mm/hr (0–20), and procalcitonin 0.50 ng/mL (< 0.09). Urine hCG negative. Urinalysis showed trace leukocyte esterase (negative), negative nitrites, and 1–5 WBCs (0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis showed mesenteric edema, dilation of the appendix (8mm), and fat stranding throughout the lower abdomen and pelvis. She received two intravenous (IV) fluid boluses, anti-pyrectics and was transferred to our pediatric hospital.

### Nutcracker syndrome mimicking new daily persistent headache: a case report [^ee1e8a3f]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

This is the first literature report of co-existing superior mesenteric artery syndrome and Nutcracker syndrome where surgical correction led to a prompt relief of refractory new daily persistent headache.
In patients with refractory new daily persistent headache and orthostatic symptoms, one may consider a differential diagnosis of Nutcracker syndrome, especially in children, patients with comorbid hypermobility syndromes, and in the presence of hematuria or gastric symptoms.
In patients with confirmed Nutcracker syndrome and headache, a trial of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid may be attempted.

### Assessing and investigating children with suspected bone and abdominal tumours: an e-Delphi consensus process [^2d4ff583]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Childhood cancer is often perceived to be rare; however, while individual childhood cancer types are rare, collectively they are more common than many believe. An individual's cumulative risk of cancer from birth to age 15 years is 1 in 450, with 1840 new cases diagnosed in children and young people (CYP) aged 0–15 each year in the UK. Incidence of childhood cancer has increased by 15% since the 1990s. Although survival estimates are also increasing (from 77% in 2001 to 84% in 2016 across all childhood cancers) progress in the UK lags behind other Western European countries.

Many CYP experience delays in their cancer diagnosis. Such delays are multifactorial. Unlike in adult cancers, prevention and screening strategies are not available, therefore early diagnosis is key to optimising outcomes, reducing morbidity, mortality and treatment burden. A possible explanation behind delayed diagnosis lies with childhood cancer symptomatology posing a diagnostic dilemma. Symptoms are often non-specific, mimicking other more common ailments such as gastroenteritis, migraines or can masquerade as pain attributed to minor injury. Furthermore, perceived rarity means childhood cancer is not often considered as a potential diagnosis by the parent or clinician. The 2015 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued a guideline on 'Suspected cancer: recognition and referral'which covers all ages. There is a real need for paediatric-specific guidance, as adult cancers manifest and present differently. This current guidance is directed at primary care with the 'end-point' being referral onto secondary care. Children with cancer experience diagnostic delay throughout the health service both at primary care and secondary care level and a referral from primary to secondary care can add significant length to the patient's diagnostic journey.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^0c49de00]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Health care providers are likely to encounter patients with recurrent unexplained abdominal pain. Because hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease, it may not be part of the differential diagnosis, especially for patients who do not have concurrent skin swelling in addition to abdominal symptoms. Abdominal pain is very common in patients with HAE, occurring in up to 93% of patients, with recurrent abdominal pain reported in up to 80% of patients. In 49% of HAE attacks with abdominal symptoms, isolated abdominal pain was the only symptom. Other abdominal symptoms that commonly present in patients with HAE include distension, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 6 to 23 years. Under-recognition of HAE in patients presenting with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms is a key factor contributing to the delay in diagnosis, increasing the likelihood of unnecessary or exploratory surgeries or procedures and the potential risk of related complications. HAE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with unexplained abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea who have complete resolution of symptoms between episodes. As highly effective targeted therapies for HAE exist, recognition and diagnosis of HAE in patients presenting with isolated abdominal pain may significantly improve morbidity and mortality for these individuals.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^486b4c8f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### A 59-year-old man with fatigue and abdominal pain [^bbdf875d]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man with a history of nephrolithiasis and gastroesophageal reflux who sought evaluation for fatigue and abdominal pain. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is iteratively refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Abdominal pain in children [^efde89e0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons pediatric patients seek emergency care. The emergency physician must be able to distinguish diagnoses requiring immediate attention from self-limiting processes. Pediatric patients can be challenging, particularly those who are preverbal, and therefore, the clinician must rely on a detailed history from a parent or caregiver as well as a careful physical examination in order to narrow the differential diagnosis. This article highlights several pediatric diagnoses presenting as abdominal pain, including surgical emergencies, nonsurgical diagnoses, and extraabdominal processes, and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of each.

TABLE 2
Gastrointestinal Disorders That Overlap the Abdominal Symptoms of HAE

Episodic abdominal pain; recurrent small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology; or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis. Pertinent history may include recurrent episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria. Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with GI symptoms are summarized in Table 3. Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, HAE attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. In HAE, recurrent abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks. Abdominal pain in HAE is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting. During an attack, patients may have abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an abdominal HAE attack. In our clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs and symptoms would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks. Nonresponse to glucocorticoids, antihistamines, or epinephrine is an additional indication that a mechanism other than histamine-mediated angioedema is involved.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^4889bbb3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^aa4755be]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric somatic symptom and related disorders — risk factors and psychiatric comorbidity across outpatient settings — are linked to identifiable demographics and high rates of diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Patients who are adolescents, female, from minority ethnicities, from nonintact families, from urban dwellings, with past psychological trauma, lower parental education, or family history of these disorders are more likely to present with unexplained medical symptoms and are also at much higher risk of comorbid psychiatric problems. In a pediatric neurology cohort for headache, vertigo, and syncope, 31 patients were evaluated and 93.5% had a diagnosable disorder by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. In a pediatric cardiology clinic chest pain cohort with normal workups, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 74%. In primary care, standardized interviews found recurrent abdominal pain patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety (79%) and depressive disorders (43%) than controls. Among juvenile fibromyalgia patients, a high prevalence of current and lifetime anxiety and mood disorders was detected. Longitudinally, after referral to a pediatric neurology headache clinic for 8 years, persistence or worsening of headaches was highly associated with comorbid psychiatric conditions and resolution strongly correlated with absence of mental health conditions.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^ed658d62]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

### Diagnoses of exclusion in the workup of abdominal complaints [^8feea1c7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

Managing acute pain in individuals with preexisting chronic pain — prevalence and opioid avoidance for common syndromes are outlined: Frequent headaches occur in up to 15% of adolescents, and functional abdominal pain occurs in 13.5% of children and adolescents. Some chronic conditions that PHCPs commonly encounter (eg, headache, migraine, abdominal pain) should generally not be treated with opioids; in these cases, opioid treatment might mask a more serious underlying diagnosis, and nonopioid medications are often more effective at providing symptomatic relief, and hence, in general, these pain syndromes should not be treated with opioids.

### A pediatric patient with ascites, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia: a rare presentation for a common illness [^e8be4861]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 7-year-old female patient presented to our pediatric emergency department with 5 days of fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and 2 days of periorbital swelling. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed a negative monospot test, neutropenia, atypical lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia in addition to transaminitis and proteinuria. An abdominal ultrasound obtained identified hepatosplenomegaly, moderate ascites, acalculous cholecystitis, and a distended appendix with periappendiceal fluid. She was admitted to gastroenterology for further management with antibiotics and surgery and hematology consults. Ultimately, Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction was positive. This case highlights an atypical presentation of Epstein-Barr virus and the collaborative approach to diagnosis.

### Abdominal and lower back pain in pediatric idiopathic stabbing headache [^1b423624]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic stabbing headache (ISH) is a primary headache syndrome characterized by transient, sharp, stabbing pains located in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Reports of pediatric ISH are rare, and extracephalic pain in pediatric ISH is extremely rare. Here we report the case of a 7-year-old male patient suffering from frequent, short, stabbing headache, which was occasionally associated with abdominal and lower back pain. Various investigations were normal. He was diagnosed with ISH, and valproic acid was administered to relieve his headache and accompanying symptoms. Our case demonstrates that abdominal and lower back pain may occur in pediatric ISH. This case may provide new evidence linking ISH and migraine by showing that extracephalic symptoms accompanying ISH are similar to those of migraine. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying the headache and abdominal and lower back pain associated with ISH may be similar to that of a migraine headache. Accumulating additional cases by asking specific questions regarding the presence of the unusual symptoms presented in our case may help to establish a detailed clinical profile of these unfamiliar and peculiar symptoms in the pediatric ISH population.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^8755fe23]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

### Abdominal epilepsy, a rare cause of abdominal pain: the need to investigate thoroughly as opposed to making rapid attributions of psychogenic causality [^7077f24a]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Study

To illustrate, we present the case of a fifty-two-year-old woman with a 15-year history of recurrent, paroxysmal abdominal pain, absence episodes and two genralized seizures diagnosed as abdominal epilepsy by a gastroenterologist and neurologist following a lengthy period of clinical assessment.

The abdominal epilepsy was experienced as abdominal pain occurring suddenly, resolving spontaneously and lasting for 10–15 mins with palpitation and stuttering. These attacks occcured at random intervals, sometimes every few days and sometimes once a month. Her symptoms during these episodes included cramps, episodic vomiting, headache and pain experienced as a pressure sensation in her abdomen that radiated to her lumbar area. Although the patient experienced two episodes of generalized seizures, her abdominal pain was typically not associated with convulsions or loss of consciousness, although was typically followed by somnolence, lethargy, and increased sleep. The patient also reported absence episodes, independent of the abdominal pain. She described the absence episodes as "like watching the world from the TV — I know what is happening but I cannot interact". The patient's pain was reportedly not helped by any medication.

At the age of 10 years, the patient reportedly experienced an episode in which she felt dizzy and lost the ability to concentrate, experienced frequent odd sensations in her left ear persisting until the present and, occasionally, a pulling sensation on her teeth. In spite of the unremarkable results yielded by an EEG investigation, the episodes of compromised consciousness continued. Her emotional response to these symptoms was a depressed mood throughout her adolescence and she was consequently referred for counseling. During her mid-20s, the patient continued to experience sensations in her left ear, with these symptoms progressing to the point that she believed that she was suffering from some type of auditory condition. At the age of thirty seven, the patient suffered her first episode of the abdominal symptoms combined with a generalized seizure. Specifically, she awakened with abdominal pain during the night and went to the toilet, where she collapsed and had a generalized seizure. This event included tongue biting and incontinence, with the entire episode lasting ten minutes. She was confused post-ictally, and the patient required several days to fully recover. She was prescribed carbamazepine and reportedly did not suffer any further generalized seizures for well over a decade.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — clinical features and burden include recurrent, discrete, self-limited episodes defined by symptom-based criteria and the absence of positive laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic testing, with intense vomiting and early-morning onset described. A large case series found that although it affects only 5% to 15% of a child's lifetime, it results in 24 days of missed school and an annualized cost of care of $17,035. The vomiting is intense (median 6 times/ hour at peak), often bilious (83% in some series), and episodes often commence in the early morning (eg, 3–4 AM or upon awakening). CVS starts commonly in early childhood, and the vomiting symptoms may abate with the onset of classical migraine headaches during adolescence.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^d6c741af]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Index case (IV1)

A 7-year-old schoolgirl awoke at 02:00, crying, pale and distressed with a diffuse, severe ache in her left foot lasting for 15 minutes. She was afebrile, lucid and the foot was normal with no tenderness or allodynia. She could walk during the pain. A similar episode occurred a few days later. Before investigations for a focal cause of left foot pain took place, she awoke twice with right foot pain, nausea and abdominal pain. On a fifth occasion, she awoke with a right-sided severe throbbing frontal headache, photophobia, nausea, pallor and right foot pain.

This patient reported over 30 episodes involving the left or right foot over the next 2 years. The foot pain occurred prior to the headache or concurrently. Sometimes the foot pain or headache occurred independently. The headache was frontal, unilateral, moderate to severe, pounding, with marked photophobia and lasted up to 5 hours. The initial episodes were nocturnal, but five episodes subsequently occurred during the day. On 12 occasions she had malaise and tingling in her foot for 30–60 minutes before the onset of limb pain. At follow-up at 15 years of age, the episodes of limb pain usually occurred when awake, often starting in the evening, and were coupled with ipsilateral or contralateral headache in 50% of occurrences.

Patient IV2

This female patient had severe motion sickness aged 2–4 years and daytime episodes of foot pain at 6 years of age, starting with dizziness and a deep aching in the left or right foot or hand for about 10 minutes. One limb was involved at a time, followed by a unilateral, fronto-orbital, throbbing headache, ipsilateral or contralateral to the limb pain, sometimes with abdominal pain. She was quiet, pale, nauseated and photophobic during the episodes and wanted to sleep in a dark room, awakening pain-free a few hours later. Episodes occurred at a maximum every 2 months. On some occasions the headaches were preceded by dizziness, but not by limb pain.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^804394ba]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^833f6b24]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sporadic reports of migraine limb pain date back to 1873 (see), with subsequent reports of recurrent limb pain temporally related to migraine, cluster headache or cluster migraine episodes. The estimated frequency of such limb pain in adult migraineurs is 2–4.4%. Two-thirds of children with migraine have one or more periodic syndromes, most commonly limb pain (44%), abdominal migraine (48%) and motion sickness (41%). The disorder may be mistaken for joint or bone pathology, 'growing pains' or a psychological disturbance.

There is one previous report of a family with childhood limb pain and migraine, usually in adulthood, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, including male to male transmission (see II2 to III3 in their figure 1), but there was no temporal association between the limb pain and headache. We report here a four-generation family with recurrent limb pain in close temporal association with headache and review the evidence for limb pain as part of the migraine spectrum.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

Somatic symptom and related disorders — overview and pediatric clinical features are outlined, with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition recognizing 7 distinct somatic symptom and related disorders. Presentations are myriad, most often involving neurologic, pain, autonomic, or gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and children and adolescents often have multiple visits in primary care and other settings; vague, poorly described complaints, stress-linked fluctuations, and lack of physical or laboratory findings are common. Common symptoms include pseudoneurologic complaints (amnesia, difficulty with swallowing or voice, vision or hearing impairment, syncope, seizure, paralysis or paresis), pain symptoms (headache, back pain, extremity pain, dysuria), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, multiple food intolerances), and cardiopulmonary symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness). Epidemiology notes that in adult primary care populations, between 10% and 15% of patients have a diagnosis of 1 of these disorders; among children and adolescents, recurrent abdominal pain and headaches account for 5% and between 20% and 55% of pediatric office visits, respectively; 10% of adolescents report frequent headaches, chest pain, nausea, and fatigue. Health-care utilization is high: patients use all types of medical services more frequently, are more likely to "doctor shop", and in 2005 were estimated to have incrementally added $265 billion to the cost of health care in the United States.

We present an adolescent girl with a 1-day history of acute urinary retention and lower abdominal pain. She was admitted to the paediatric ward for ongoing treatment and investigations. Due to a myriad of factors including pain and anxiety, challenges posed included an incomplete initial abdominal and external genital examination. This case report highlights the importance of a focused history and performing an appropriate sensitive examination at the time of presentation. Furthermore, we explore the common causes of new onset urinary retention and unravel the case as it unfolds. We also highlight differential diagnoses (however, uncommon), which must be considered and not overlooked to avoid unnecessary investigations and to ensure timely management.

### Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency presenting as recurrent abdominal pain in childhood [^07e09c13]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain remains one of the most common symptoms in pediatrics. We present the case of a 3-year-old girl who had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain requiring more than 13 visits to the emergency department. A diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was eventually made. Urea cycle disorders often present beyond the neonatal period with frequent vomiting episodes; however, recurrent abdominal pain as a presenting symptom is unusual. Unnecessary invasive investigations of recurrent abdominal pain in childhood can be avoided by considering inborn errors of metabolism earlier in the differential diagnosis.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^a54ac5f4]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient III1

Aged 46 years at the index time, this patient had episodic abdominal pain and motion sickness as a child. In her 20s and 30s she had episodes of a moderately severe deep ache in her right hip, lasting half an hour at a time, with normal examination during and between the pain. She could not recall the frequency of these episodes. At other times she had a sharp, severe, stabbing pain in her right or left hip, behind either eye, or in her right third toe. These pains came for a period of a day or two, occurred up to 20 times per day, and then abated for weeks or months. She had mild unilateral throbbing fronto-orbital headaches at other times, but never with the hip or stabbing pain. From her early 40s she had episodes of severe pain in the lower left half of her face, awakening her at night and localized to the lower molars, together with watering of both eyes. The pain lasted 20–40 minutes and was relieved by aspirin within 20–30 minutes. Sometimes she had the unilateral sensation that part of her face or her hand was enlarged for about 30 minutes just before the head pain started. From her early 40s she noted episodes of limb pain in her right or left hip, independently or associated in 50% of episodes with unilateral throbbing headache of moderate severity, nausea, photophobia and malaise. The limb pain occurred before and/or during the headache and lasted for about 30 minutes. The headache lasted longer than the limb pain (up to 60 minutes).

Patient III2

As a child, this patient had recurrent hip pain that was never diagnosed or investigated. As an adult, she had monthly (usually premenstrual) heavy, severe pain in her left jaw starting in the morning and accompanied later by pain in her left shoulder and left neck. During these pains she had blurring of her vision for 5–10 minutes and, at the same time, pain in her left hip and knee. The pains stopped her from doing her usual activities.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^54888e46]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Educational Objectives

Appendicitis is a common presentation in pediatric urgent cares, emergency departments, and primary clinic sites that can have various confounding presentations, and this case directs the reader's attention to Dientamoeba fragilis, a parasite that can go overlooked when evaluating and working up acute abdominal pain.
With the rise of global migration and the burgeoning discipline of newcomer medicine, the case report concludes that the role of expanded infectious workups with the consideration of stool ova and parasite testing for abdominal pain in these vulnerable populations is critical for providing high-value care.

### An infected urachal cyst in a 4-year-old girl presenting with recurrent abdominal pain [^4061bf57]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urachal cysts are remnants of urachal ducts and usually present when they get infected or undergo malignant transformation.

Case Report

A 4-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with intermittent abdominal pain, fever, dysuria, and umbilical swelling. She was diagnosed with an abscess related to an infected urachal cyst by ultrasound. The patient was treated with antibiotics, and the abscess was drained by Interventional Radiology with ultrasound guidance. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged home. The urachal cyst was excised a month later. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Though urachal cysts are rare, it is important to consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen and recurrent abdominal pain in the ED setting.

Educational Objectives

Given the rising prevalence of cannabis use in youth, cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) should be on the differential diagnosis and a lipase level should be assessed when a patient presents with symptoms of acute pancreatitis, especially when there is no clear etiology from initial investigations.
A comprehensive cannabis history should be obtained, including consumption patterns in the days and weeks prior to AP and the method of consumption.

### Silently suffering: a pediatric black widow spider envenomation [^1ab0278b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Black widow spiders are distributed worldwide and, although rarely fatal, account for significant morbidity. Diagnosis can be challenging, and children are at risk of increased morbidity due to their small size.

Case Report

We present a case of a 3-year-old boy who was brought to our emergency department because of sudden ear pain followed by labored breathing, abdominal pain, refusal or inability to speak, and grunting respirations. A black widow spider bite was suspected based on additional history obtained, and the spider was found in his helmet, confirming the diagnosis. The patient had progressive respiratory distress and somnolence and was intubated and transferred to a local pediatric intensive care unit. Antivenom was not initially available and eventually declined by the family. The child received supportive care and recovered after several days. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This case illustrates the potentially deadly effects a black widow envenomation could cause in a child, and that bite location can affect the constellation of symptoms. It is a reminder that toxins, including that of the black widow spider, should be on the differential for acute abdominal pain, especially with autonomic features.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^19f31541]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Signs and symptoms of childhood cancer: a guide for early recognition [^21af8865]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although cancer in children is rare, it is the second most common cause of childhood mortality in developed countries. It often presents with nonspecific symptoms similar to those of benign conditions, leading to delays in the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Primary care physicians should have a raised index of suspicion and explore the possibility of cancer in children who have worrisome or persisting signs and symptoms. Red flag signs for leukemia or lymphoma include unexplained and protracted pallor, malaise, fever, anorexia, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hemorrhagic diathesis, and hepatosplenomegaly. New onset or persistent morning headaches associated with vomiting, neurologic symptoms, or back pain should raise concern for tumors of the central nervous system. Palpable masses in the abdomen or soft tissues, and persistent bone pain that awakens the child are red flags for abdominal, soft tissue, and bone tumors. Leukokoria is a red flag for retinoblastoma. Endocrine symptoms such as growth arrest, diabetes insipidus, and precocious or delayed puberty may be signs of endocranial or germ cell tumors. Paraneoplastic manifestations such as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, rheumatic symptoms, or hypertension are rare and may be related to neuroblastoma, leukemia, or Wilms tumor, respectively. Increased suspicion is also warranted for conditions associated with a higher risk of childhood cancer, including immunodeficiency syndromes and previous malignancies, as well as with certain genetic conditions and familial cancer syndromes such as Down syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hemihypertrophy, neurofibromatosis, and retinoblastoma.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). As prognosis has improved, CF has changed from a pediatric disease to the current situation wherein most people with CF are adults. With improved survival, the spectrum of pathologies causing abdominal pain in CF has shifted. Despite this, there have been relatively few previous publications focusing on gastrointestinal disease in CF adults. The aim of this review was to examine the characteristics, differential diagnosis, investigation, and optimal management of adults with CF presenting with abdominal pain.

### Sexually active cisgender female adolescent with red urine and abdominal pain [^101d1af0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical Course

A sexually active cisgender female adolescent with a two-week history of back pain presented to clinic with red urine, dysuria, nausea, and diarrhea. On examination, she was found to have CMT and negative STI screens. She was diagnosed with PID. The patient visited the ED for continued abdominal pain three days after initiating treatment for PID. Imaging ruled out tubular ovarian abscess (TOA). She later returned to her PCP's office with improved nausea and pain.

Final Diagnosis

Pelvic inflammatory disease.

Making a Diagnosis of PID

PID is a clinical diagnosis, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends presumptive treatment for women at risk of STIs with pelvic or lower abdominal pain AND at least one of the following four criteria: (1) no other cause for the illness can be identified, (2) CMT, (3) uterine tenderness, or (4) adnexal tenderness.

Supportive examination and laboratory findings include fever, vaginal discharge with white blood cells (WBCs) on microscopy, elevated CRP and ESR, and positive STI tests. These are not required for diagnosis. This patient had abdominal pain, CMT, and mildly elevated ESR. Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment should not wait for laboratory results and are imperative to avoid complications. Frequently, as with this patient, STI results may be negative as testing for many implicated pathogens is not readily accessible (see section "Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female") and the available STI testing is conducted on a sample collected from the lower reproductive tract, not the upper reproductive organs.

Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female

Several diagnoses were considered for this patient (Table 1). The differential diagnosis for PID can be even more broad.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^7474e955]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial workup included a complete blood count (CBC) that showed a normal white blood cell count without anemia or platelet derangements but with a small elevation in eosinophils. While possibly incidental, the elevation was notable given her recent immigration, lack of prior testing or prophylactic treatment, and mother's concern for parasitosis. An abdominal ultrasound was unable to visualize the appendix. Urinalysis showed elevated ketones but was otherwise unremarkable. Based on the elicited history, a stool ova and parasite test was sent and the patient was discharged home with strict return precautions. This course of action was taken as she was low risk for appendicitis based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC), her pain improved with oral acetaminophen, and the family lived near the hospital and had the ability to return quickly if needed. No abdominal computed tomography (CT) was ordered in favor of watchful waiting. Her pARC score of 14% was based on her sex, age, white blood cell count and neutrophilic percentage, duration of symptoms, maximal tenderness in her right lower abdominal quadrant, positive guarding without pain migration from the periumbilical region or demonstrated pain with walking. The following day, the stool ova and parasite test resulted positive for Dientamoeba fragilis. The patient's family was contacted, and due to her persistent pain, she was prescribed metronidazole 3 times daily for 10 days with appropriate resolution of her symptoms.

### Chronic abdominal pain in children [^e54cc008]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain, defined as long-lasting intermittent or constant abdominal pain, is a common pediatric problem encountered by primary care physicians, medical subspecialists, and surgical specialists. Chronic abdominal pain in children is usually functional, that is, without objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. The Subcommittee on Chronic Abdominal Pain of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has prepared this report based on a comprehensive, systematic review and rating of the medical literature. This report accompanies a clinical report based on the literature review and expert opinion. The subcommittee examined the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a medical and psychological history, diagnostic tests, and pharmacologic and behavioral therapy. The presence of alarm symptoms or signs (such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent fever, chronic severe diarrhea, and significant vomiting) is associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease. There was insufficient evidence to state that the nature of the abdominal pain or the presence of associated symptoms (such as anorexia, nausea, headache, and joint pain) can discriminate between functional and organic disorders. Although children with chronic abdominal pain and their parents are more often anxious or depressed, the presence of anxiety, depression, behavior problems, or recent negative life events does not distinguish between functional and organic abdominal pain. Most children who are brought to the primary care physician's office for chronic abdominal pain are unlikely to require diagnostic testing. Pediatric studies of therapeutic interventions were examined and found to be limited or inconclusive.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^740e294c]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Limb pain without headache

In three patients (IV1, IV3 and III1) limb pain also occurred on occasion without headache, when it was similar to that occurring with headache, but sometimes associated with abdominal pain for 30 minutes (patient IV1), back pain (patient IV3) and stabbing pains (patient III1).

Periodic syndrome and limb pain

Four of our patients had abdominal pain (patient IV1) or motion sickness (patient IV4) or both (patients IV2 and III1) during childhood. One patient (IV1) had both abdominal and limb pain during childhood, but only the recurrent limb pain continued into adolescence was associated with migraine headache. Another patient had abdominal and limb pain concurrently with MA* (IV2) and one patient (III1) had recurrent abdominal pain and motion sickness during childhood, but MO with limb pain and LHH starting in adulthood.

Response to treatment

Headaches and limb pain responded well to analgesia during episodes. In one patient (III1) prophylaxis was indicated and the frequency of headaches and limb pain was reduced by propranolol.

### Abdominal hereditary angio-oedema caught on magnetic resonance imaging [^92425e24]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Hereditary angio-oedema (HAE) is a rare condition which normally presents with recurrent swelling of the lips, extremities and pharynx. Abdominal angio-oedema, which presents typically with abdominal pain and distension, is often missed due to the large number of differentials of acute abdominal pain. The average time from first presentation to diagnosis in HAE has been reported as 8–10 years.

We report a case of a 17-year-old woman presenting with recurrent admissions to hospital with acute abdominal pain, who was later diagnosed with HAE. She had no extra-abdominal symptoms of the disease other than ankle swelling. An MRI of the small bowel was performed during an acute attack of pain. This demonstrated ascites and small bowel submucosal oedema, in what may be the first example of abdominal angio-oedema visualised on MRI. These findings spontaneously resolved on repeat imaging 72 hours later.

### Acute intermittent porphyria in children: a case report and review of the literature [^46a1f08d]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant inborn error of heme metabolism, typically presents in adulthood, most often in women in the reproductive age group. There are limited reports on the clinical presentation in children, and in contrast to the adults, most of the reported pediatric cases are male. While acute abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom in children, seizures are commonly seen and may precede the diagnosis of AIP. As an example, we report a 9year old developmentally normal pre-pubertal boy who presented with acute abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation followed by hyponatremia, seizures, weakness and neuropathy. After a diagnostic odyssey, his urine porphobilinogen was found to be significantly elevated and genetic testing showed a previously unreported consensus splice-site mutation IVS4-1G > A in the HMBS gene confirming the diagnosis of AIP. Here, we discuss the clinical presentation in this case, and 15 reported pediatric cases since the last review 30years ago and discuss the differential diagnosis and challenges in making the diagnosis in children. We review the childhood-onset cases reported in the Longitudinal Study of the Porphyrias Consortium. Of these, genetically and biochemically confirmed patients, 11 of 204 (5%) reported onset of attacks in childhood. Most of these patients (91%) reported recurrent attacks following the initial presentation. Thus, AIP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, seizures, weakness and neuropathy.

### Abdominal pain in children: from the eternal city to the examination room [^09196710]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom in children. The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain is extensive; however, a vast majority of patients ultimately are diagnosed with functional abdominal pain disorders. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined using the recently released Rome IV criteria. These are not diagnoses of exclusion. If there are no alarm signs, the diagnosis may be made with a focused evaluation. Treatment of these disorders requires a biopsychosocial approach to the disorder and an individualized and multipronged treatment plan.

Case presentation

A 41 year-old Hispanic female with known uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 8 years treated with metformin presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest and abdominal pain, dyspnea, intractable nausea, and vomiting. She was in acute distress with tachycardia and hypertension, found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis, and diagnosed with an active COVID-19 infection prompting hospitalization. She was admitted to ICU and treated with continuous insulin infusion and IV fluids. She also acknowledged longstanding complaints of headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations started several years ago prior to this presentation. Given chest pain at initial presentation, and elevated serum troponin level, she underwent further evaluation with CT chest, which revealed a 12 × 8 cm adrenal mass and a horseshoe kidney. The clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed with elevated urine and serum metanephrine and noremetanephrine. Her diabetic ketoacidosis improved, and her COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic during her admission. She was discharged with long-acting insulin, and an alpha-blocker (terazosin), and the initial treatment plan was to proceed with resection of her adrenal mass. Nonetheless, her planned surgery was cancelled a few times due to patient's insurance problems, and incompliance with use of phenoxybenzamine.

### Ovarian cyst torsion in a toddler [^aafcafa4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is encountered frequently, and the differential diagnosis is extensive. Acute ovarian torsion in children is rare, especially at a very young age, and a difficult diagnosis to make. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will result if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely fashion. We presented a case of acute ovarian cyst torsion in a 2-year-old girl who originally presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultimately, she was found to have a 2-cm cyst of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Because acute ovarian torsion in a very young child is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimize morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential of any female children with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware that the potential of acute ovarian torsion in a very young child has a high index of suspicion and seek early operative intervention.

### Perspectives on the clinical significance of functional pain syndromes in children [^177beffb]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Lack of a common language hampers clinical and scientific progress

Too often, a patient receives a diagnostic label or labels that reflect the specialist's area of expertise as opposed to the patient's overall experience. For example, a patient with excessive bowel symptoms might present to a gastroenterologist who diagnoses her with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), whereas a patient who has widespread muscle pain and tenderness may go to a rheumatologist who diagnoses him with fibromyalgia. A recent study showed that these different conditions may actually reflect a common entity but have labels that reflect the specialists' area of expertise. The most common diagnoses that reflect this functional overlap in pediatrics include headache, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The involvement of organ-system specialists in evaluating and diagnosing these complex chronic pain conditions mean that very little research has been done across disciplines to determine if these conditions are truly different or do in fact reflect a common entity.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^0035915f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome in children — background and burden — is prevalent in 1.9%–2.3% of children, markedly affects quality of life and healthcare utilization with recurrent emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school-related disability, and presents as stereotypical attacks of emesis that closely resemble migraine. There is insufficient knowledge of exact pathophysiology and lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms, leading to inconsistency and poor consensus among practitioners; therapies are typically empiric and/or targeted towards common comorbidities with substantial focus on pharmacological interventions. These guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty in evidence and formulate recommendations.

### The spectrum of pediatric amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome [^7e0ec1cb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain gained widespread medical attention in the middle of the twentieth century. The nascency of the field resulted in a host of names for the presentations of idiopathic musculoskeletal pain. Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMPS) is a term that encompasses the spectrum of manifestations of chronic pediatric musculoskeletal pain. The common thread underlying these different subtypes is central and/or peripheral sensory pain amplification, hence the name amplified musculoskeletal pain. The term AMPS is understandable and provides the patient with a mechanism by which to understand and validate the reality of his/her pain.

Most reports focus on one specific subset of chronic pain such as fibromyalgia, widespread pain, idiopathic localized or diffuse pain, functional pain (frequently functional abdominal pain), or headache. One group uses complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) spectrum disorder to include patients with limited pain but who did not fulfill CRPS criteria. However, we argue that these presentations are subsets of pediatric amplified pain. Many children exhibit features of multiple subsets of AMPS, having one initial subset followed later by another, or develop intermittent symptoms. Those with intermittent pain are not well described in the literature and frequently languish without a diagnosis. It does not seem reasonable that these children have multiple different pain conditions, but rather one condition with varying manifestations that may fluctuate in an individual over time. An appreciation of where these children fit into the spectrum may lead to insights into the pathophysiology and psychopathology of the condition in addition to having implications for treatment.

### An 8-year-old boy with fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia [^218c5fd6]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with 5 days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED), out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania 10 months before admission. The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and was evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multiorgan involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.

### High-risk chief complaints III: abdomen and extremities [^ba24b425]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal and extremity complaints are common in the emergency department (ED) and, because of their frequency, clinical vigilance is vital in order not to miss the timely diagnosis of occult or delayed emergencies. Such emergencies, if not timely managed, are sources of significant patient morbidity and mortality and may expose ED physicians to possible litigation. Each patient complaint yields to a nuanced approach in diagnostics and therapeutics that can lead physicians toward the ruling in or out of the correct high-risk diagnosis. This article discusses the approach and risk management of this high-risk subset of abdominal and extremity diagnoses.

### Lead poisoning as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with chronic abdominal pain: a case-control study in tehran-iran [^cbb77cd9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study showed that lead poisoning is still a serious problem in Iran, despite the precautions against utilizing lead in different industries. Lead poisoning could result in various symptoms in children, including chronic abdominal pain, poor appetite, and growth failure. These results should be taken seriously as a health concern, especially for children. Neglecting the risks of lead exposure in pediatrics might have irreversible effects.

### Adolescent abdominal pain due to rare mullerian duct anomaly [^6a9111bf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint to the Emergency Department (ED). Often, rare etiologies can be discovered in the work up of this common complaint. Here we present the case of an adolescent female who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) or Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich Syndrome. A 12 year old female with known renal agenesis presented with 5 days of left sided abdominal pain that then developed into right lower quadrant pain. She had regular menses for the last 2 years. Ultrasound (US) showed a fluid collection in the lower uterine segment and a complex cystic structure anterior to the uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the patient to have didelphys uterus with "severe dilatation of the cervix/vaginal canal… extending from the right uterine horn" and left-sided ovarian and Fallopian tube torsion. She was taken to the operating room where she underwent vaginal septum excision and a left salpingo-oopherectomy. OHVIRA includes the triad of obstructed hemivagina, uterine didelphys, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. This occurs due to embryologic arrest of the mullerian and mesonephric ducts at 8 weeks of gestation. Most abnormalities are right sided which leads to right lower abdominal and pelvic pain approximately 4 months post-menarche. Diagnosis of OHVIRA is made utilizing US and CT scans. MRI can also be useful to further delineate specific anatomy. It is important for the emergency physician to be aware of this entity as most patients don't present to care until acute, severe symptoms develop. This makes it more likely for them to seek care in the ED as opposed to the outpatient setting.

D. fragilis as an Appendicitis Mimicker

The role of D. fragilis in acute and chronic abdominal pain is likely underappreciated. An intestinal protozoan, it preferentially inhabits the cecum and ascending colon. It has a global distribution with a greater prevalence in Europe and the Americas. The prevalence has been shown to be highly variable, however, and is dependent on the individual study populations and detection methods with measurements between 0.4% and 71% of specific populations. The mechanism by which D. fragilis is transmitted has not been conclusively elucidated, although the most accepted route is fecal-oral, and asymptomatic colonization rates in children can be high. It has been postulated that the nematode Enterobius vermicularis could serve as a vector. Both theories would also explain why D. fragilis has a higher affinity for children in daycare settings and has shown higher prevalence in populations experiencing limited sanitation or overcrowded conditions.

In children, D. fragilis has been identified as benign, causing asymptomatic colonization, and treatment of asymptomatic infections is not indicated. Treatment is often reserved to patients with immunodeficiencies (usually hyper-IgM syndrome) or infections with severe symptoms in healthy children. However, there is a growing body of evidence that this protozoan could play a more active role in gastrointestinal disturbances than previously thought, since it is often not tested, and despite its known pathogenicity with well-established roles in both acute and chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain, it remains relatively unknown among general and subspecialized pediatricians. Moreover, it likely goes undetected in equivocal appendicitis cases as stool ova and parasite testing is not frequently obtained, suggesting that its causative role in abdominal pain could be greater than currently appreciated. In our case, with highly concerning exam findings but equivocal vital sign and laboratory findings of acute appendicitis, careful history taking not only led to a diagnosis but also spared the patient from further CT imaging — a relevant concern, with well-established links between childhood radiation exposure and future malignancies. Taken together, a nuanced history and thorough evaluation of confounding causes of acute appendicitis is critically important, with particular respect to D. fragilis.
