## Question

What infectious causative agents are associated with a dod bite?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which infectious causative agents are associated with dog bites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and infection rates in dog bites. Then, I should catalog the core bacterial flora and highlight high-consequence pathogens. Next, I will consider anaerobes and skin contaminants that contribute to polymicrobial infections. After that, I need to review viral threats, especially rabies, and any emerging zoonoses. Then, I should weigh host and wound risk factors that modify pathogen risk. Finally, I will synthesize management: empiric antibiotic choices, wound care, and rabies/tetanus prophylaxis, cross-checking guideline nuances as I go [^112mVfHi] [^111ECh8k].

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic frame before listing organisms: dog-bite infections are polymicrobial and occur in roughly 3–25% of bites, with risk modulated by wound depth, site (hands and face are higher risk), time to care, and host factors like immunosuppression or diabetes; I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing these ranges across all settings, so I'll anchor them to contemporary reviews and consensus statements [^1153v47K] [^111ECh8k] [^111qxQys].

> Now, about the primary bacterial pathogens — wait, let me verify the most prevalent organism in canine bite flora: Pasteurella species, particularly Pasteurella multocida, are frequently present and drive early-onset cellulitis; I initially thought "in 50% of infected dog bites", but I should correct that to "about 50% of dog bites are associated with the presence of P. multocida", with clinical isolation rates varying by series; severe invasive disease, including sepsis and purpura fulminans, is rare but documented and should keep us cautious when patients appear systemically ill [^1153v47K] [^113gydtT] [^111q3mxx].

> I will now examine Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a high-consequence pathogen carried by many healthy dogs; it can cause fulminant sepsis, DIC, meningitis, and endocarditis, especially in patients with asplenia or alcohol use disorder, but also in immunocompetent hosts; mechanistically, immune evasion and coagulation factor interference have been described — hold on, I should verify those mechanistic data because they influence the clinical picture of purpura and shock, and yes, both TLR4 signaling escape and factor X protease activity have been reported [^114EVN7o] [^114xEEMz] [^1142ffV6] [^112GXniK].

> Next, I should review the common contributors from human skin and mixed oral flora that complicate these wounds: Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA in some communities) and beta-hemolytic streptococci often act as co-pathogens, while anaerobes such as Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella are part of the polymicrobial mix — let me double-check guidance that emphasizes targeting both aerobic and anaerobic organisms when treating established infection or high-risk wounds, which is consistent across surgical and infectious disease sources [^111ECh8k] [^111qxQys] [^116TuMqa] [^114mbgxG].

> But wait, what about viral pathogens — this is where public health risk can overshadow bacterial concerns: rabies virus remains the most critical global threat, with dogs responsible for more than 99% of human cases and essentially 100% mortality once symptomatic; I need to ensure we consistently pair any discussion of pathogens with rabies risk assessment and timely post-exposure prophylaxis because that alters outcomes more than any antibiotic choice [^114FUUur] [^117XmJvT] [^111b3yDd].

> I should also consider rare and emerging agents; severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) has documented dog-to-human transmission by bite in South Korea, and although rare, it broadens the differential in endemic regions; Francisella tularensis infection can occur via dog-associated exposure after contact with infected wildlife, and multidrug-resistant organisms may be transmitted from dogs exposed to prolonged antibiotics; I'll also note uniquely canine organisms like Mycoplasma canis that have been implicated in invasive infections, albeit infrequently — hold on, these are low-incidence but high-consequence edge cases and should be tied to epidemiologic context and exposure history [^112c866x] [^111DwJ1R] [^114j6oP9] [^112fxmHK] [^117Y5AUL].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers: immunocompromised states such as asplenia or significant alcohol use elevate the risk of Capnocytophaga sepsis; diabetics, especially with peripheral neuropathy, face higher infection and limb risk; hand wounds are notorious for deep space infections and osteomyelitis, and children are prone to facial wounds with significant morbidity — let me double-check that these associations are consistently reported across orthopedic and case-based literature before over-asserting them [^114EVN7o] [^11148xnm] [^111qxQys] [^116ShkzW] [^115LbDj5].

> I need to ensure management implications mirror the pathogen spectrum: for empiric therapy, amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line because it covers Pasteurella and oral anaerobes; MRSA coverage is added based on local prevalence and patient risk factors; for severe infection or sepsis risk (e.g., asplenia after a dog bite), escalation to parenteral broad-spectrum agents with reliable aerobic and anaerobic coverage is appropriate; hold on, guidelines diverge on prophylaxis — AAFP supports prophylaxis for higher-risk bites (and often broadly), whereas the WSES/SIS-E consensus cautions against routine prophylaxis except in high-risk wounds or hosts; I should explicitly state that local protocols and patient factors should guide the decision [^112mVfHi] [^1151yZdu] [^116TuMqa] [^111ECh8k].

> I will now emphasize wound care and procedures because they modify infection risk independent of microbiology: copious irrigation, meticulous debridement, exploration for tendon or bone involvement, and removal of foreign bodies are foundational; primary closure is reasonable for low-risk dog-bite wounds (especially on the face) but high-risk wounds should heal by secondary intention; injuries to underlying structures and complex wounds warrant surgical consultation — let me verify those procedural recommendations against both emergency surgery and primary care sources for consistency [^113Xs2eU] [^112mVfHi] [^114wZCqa] [^114HTnXm].

> Hold on, I should verify the prevention bundle beyond bacteria: every dog-bite evaluation must include rabies risk assessment and tetanus status review; PEP for rabies should follow exposure risk stratification, and tetanus vaccination should be updated per guideline intervals; I will also remind myself that excellent wound cleansing is a critical rabies PEP component and is time-sensitive [^111b3yDd] [^116MHbsi] [^114FUUur].

> In summary — and let me briefly reconsider for completeness — dog-bite infections are typically polymicrobial with Pasteurella multocida and Capnocytophaga canimorsus as key canine oral pathogens, plus staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes as frequent co-pathogens; rabies remains the paramount viral threat globally, with emerging zoonoses like SFTSV and occasional rare agents expanding the differential; management hinges on rigorous wound care, targeted empiric antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, and universal rabies and tetanus risk assessment, tailored to wound characteristics and host risk profile [^1153v47K] [^111ECh8k] [^114FUUur] [^112mVfHi].

---

Dog bites transmit a **polymicrobial mix** of bacteria, with **Pasteurella spp**. and Capnocytophaga canimorsus as key pathogens [^1153v47K]; C. canimorsus can cause rapid, severe sepsis [^114EVN7o], especially in asplenic or immunocompromised hosts. Other common bacteria include **Staphylococcus aureus** (including MRSA), Streptococcus species, and anaerobes such as Fusobacterium and Bacteroides [^111ECh8k] [^111qxQys]. Rarely, dog bites can transmit **rabies virus**, Leptospira, or Francisella tularensis. Prompt wound care [^113Xs2eU], targeted antibiotics [^1151yZdu], and assessment for rabies [^111b3yDd] and tetanus prophylaxis [^116MHbsi] are essential to prevent severe complications.

## Bacterial pathogens

Dog bite wounds are typically **polymicrobial**, harboring both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria [^116TuMqa] [^1112RfdJ]. The most commonly isolated bacterial species include:

| **Bacterial species** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Pasteurella spp. (e.g. P. multocida, P. canis) | - Commonly isolated from dog bite wounds [^111ECh8k] <br/> - Causes soft tissue infections, cellulitis, abscesses, and rarely systemic infections (e.g. endocarditis, prosthetic joint infections) [^1124kZW1] [^116kV4AP] |
| Capnocytophaga canimorsus | - Gram-negative rod [^114EVN7o] associated with severe sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^112GXniK] <br/> - Particularly dangerous in immunocompromised individuals, alcoholics, and asplenic patients |
| Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) | - Commonly causes soft tissue infections, abscesses, and systemic infections [^111ECh8k] |
| Streptococcus species (e.g. S. pyogenes) | - Associated with cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and systemic infections [^111ECh8k] |
| Anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas) | - Contribute to polymicrobial infections, abscess formation, and chronic wound infections [^111ECh8k] |

---

## Viral pathogens

Although bacterial infections are most common, certain **viral pathogens** can also be transmitted through dog bites. These include **Rabies virus** [^114FUUur] — a neurotropic virus causing fatal encephalitis if untreated [^117XmJvT], with dog bites the primary source of human rabies globally, particularly in endemic regions [^112kt874] — and **Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV)** [^111DwJ1R], which is rarely transmitted through dog bites [^112c866x] and causes severe febrile illness with thrombocytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction.

---

## Fungal pathogens

Fungal infections from dog bites are rare but can occur — particularly in immunocompromised individuals — with **Sporothrix schenckii** associated with sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous infection that may follow animal bites or scratches.

---

## Parasitic pathogens

Parasitic infections are uncommon but possible through dog bites; dogs serve as reservoirs for visceral leishmaniasis due to **Leishmania infantum** [^112a2g6Y], although direct transmission through bites is rare.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Dog bite infections can cause significant morbidity, including soft tissue infections, abscesses, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and systemic infections such as sepsis and endocarditis. Prompt medical evaluation, wound irrigation, debridement [^113Xs2eU], and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent complications [^1151yZdu].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include:

- **Rabies vaccination**: Mass dog vaccination campaigns significantly reduce rabies transmission [^111hPJDS].

- **Public education**: Awareness campaigns on responsible pet ownership and bite prevention [^112mVfHi].

- **Prompt medical care**: Immediate wound care, antibiotic prophylaxis [^1151yZdu], and post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies [^111b3yDd] and tetanus when indicated [^116MHbsi].

---

Dog bites can transmit a variety of infectious agents, primarily bacteria such as Pasteurella spp. and Capnocytophaga canimorsus, but also viruses, fungi, and parasites [^116TuMqa]. Prompt medical evaluation and preventive measures are essential to reduce the risk of severe complications.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin, such as burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infections. These measures can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, or severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin comprise a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on several factors, including the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. Generally, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders, such as S. aureus and GAS. Additionally, Staphylococcus spp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus spp. (including S. pyogenes) may also be involved.

### Rabies [^114FUUur]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Rabies is a life-threatening neglected tropical disease: tens of thousands of cases are reported annually in endemic countries (mainly in Africa and Asia), although the actual numbers are most likely underestimated. Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by infection with viruses of the Lyssavirus genus, which are transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal. Dogs are the most important reservoir for rabies viruses, and dog bites account for more than 99% of human cases. The virus first infects peripheral motor neurons, and symptoms occur after the virus reaches the central nervous system. Once clinical disease develops, it is almost certainly fatal.

Primary prevention involves dog vaccination campaigns to reduce the virus reservoir. If exposure occurs, timely post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent progression to clinical disease and involves appropriate wound care, the administration of rabies immunoglobulin, and vaccination. A multifaceted approach for human rabies eradication involving government support, disease awareness, vaccination of at-risk human populations and, most importantly, dog rabies control is necessary to achieve the WHO goal of reducing the number of cases of dog-mediated human rabies to zero by 2030.

### Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis following a minor DOG bite to the finger: Case report [^114xEEMz]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative bacillus present in the oral cavities of 22% to 74% of healthy dogs. Capnocytophaga canimorsus has unique virulence factors that enable it to evade the human immune system and cause life-threatening sepsis following a dog bite. We report a previously well 68-year-old woman who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure following a seemingly minor dog bite to the finger. The patient required intensive care treatment, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and multiple surgical procedures, including amputation of the affected finger. The septicemia and coagulopathy that ensued resulted in gangrene and amputation of additional fingers and toes. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of this organism among hand surgeons when faced with a patient presenting in septic shock and minimal signs at the site of a dog bite.

### Diagnosing capnocytophaga canimorsus infections [^114EVN7o]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Dogs are the most common household pets in the United States. Estimates predict that 50% of all Americans will be bitten in their lifetime by an animal and that approximately 1 million dog bites will occur annually. Capnocytophaga canimorsus is the main human pathogen associated with dog bites; this organism causes septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, and rare ocular infections. Individuals at increased risk of developing C. canimorsus infections include patients who have undergone a splenectomy and those who abuse alcohol. We describe a series of 56 isolates submitted to California's Microbial Diseases Laboratory (MDL) over a 32-year period, highlighting the laboratory and epidemiologic factors associated with these infections.

### Notes from the field: Fatal pneumonic tularemia associated with DOG exposure - Arizona, June 2016 [^114j6oP9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 125 human tularemia cases are reported in the United States annually. Humans are infected through arthropod bites, contact with infectious tissues, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms commonly begin 3–5 days after exposure and can include fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea.

Two F. tularensis subspecies, tularensis (Type A) and holarctica (Type B), cause human tularemia. Distinct clades within Type A (A. I and A. II) are associated with different virulence in humans and laboratory animals. A. II strains are localized to the western United States and associated with milder illness than are A. I strains.

Based on the patient's respiratory symptoms, radiographic findings, and lack of alternative exposure history, exposure likely occurred at her property through inhalation of F. tularensis, potentially via close contact with her dog. The dog might have transmitted infectious material through oral secretions after mouthing an infected carcass or brought infectious material on its fur into contact with the patient. Human illness linked to dogs has been documented.

The role of pulmonary sarcoidosis in this patient's illness is unclear, but it might have contributed to the severe outcome of infection with an A. II strain. Coinfection with C. difficile might also have exacerbated the clinical course of tularemia. Diagnosis of tularemia is challenging because symptoms are nonspecific and exposure history is often unclear. Thorough ascertainment of animal exposures, including the nature of contact, might refine clinical suspicion for tularemia.

### Periprosthetic joint infection in an immunocompetent patient: A case report [^1171PWCt]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a rare cause of infection, even more unusual in an immunocompetent patient. It was likely caused by a dog bite; the resulting PJI was treated with an antibiotic spacer and ceftriaxone. Cultures, laboratory markers, and clinical examination indicated that the patient was clearing the infection. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a myocardial infarction four months after antibiotic treatment and died. Our study highlights the importance of considering C. canimorsus as a cause of PJI, regardless of the patient's immunologic status. Early detection and treatment are crucial for the patient's prognosis.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of integrated bite case management and sustained DOG vaccination for rabies control [^115Y6FWN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Achieving zero wastage of PEP for low-risk bite victims is unlikely in dog rabies endemic areas. Vaccine from vials must be discarded 6–8 hours after opening. Rabies exposures constitute a small proportion of dog bites in Haiti. Our deterministic model categorizes rabies infections as confirmed, probable, suspected, and negative, using these as references. IBCM is the only program where this information is ascertainable. Total annual dog investigations and clinical outcomes indicate an increase in confirmed, probable, and suspected rabid dogs when programs are implemented. This may be due to the community and training staff becoming adept at reporting and following up on bite victims. However, data from rabies-free countries show that, despite vaccination interventions, the actual number of dog bites does not change. Although rabies among dog bite victims is rare, dog bites are common, emphasizing the importance of risk assessment to prevent administering PEP for low/no risk bites, which will grow in proportion as control programs succeed. The number of dogs testing negative for rabies increases annually due to improved vaccination and surveillance.

### Infectious complications of bite injuries [^116TuMqa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Animal and human bite injuries are a significant public health burden. Dog bites outnumber cat bites; however, cat bites pose the greatest risk for infection. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most frequent infectious manifestations resulting from bite injuries. Invasive infections may occur through direct inoculation or dissemination through the bloodstream. Although contemporary and well-designed trials are needed to inform clinical practice, preemptive antibiotic therapy following a bite injury is warranted for injuries posing a high risk for infection and for patients at risk of developing severe infection. Antibiotics should target aerobic and anaerobic microbes that comprise the oral and skin flora.

### DOG bites and diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A dangerous combination [^11148xnm]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

All animal bites have the potential to cause significant infection. In the UK, dogs are the most common source of bites. The incidence of hospital attendances attributable to dog bites has risen over the last decade. Patient groups at particular risk of bites and/or complications of infection include those at extremes of age, the immunosuppressed, and patients with diabetes. We report the case of a patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who was admitted on two separate occasions with unprovoked bites to his toes while asleep, by his pet dog. He ultimately required terminalisation of the affected digits. Although unusual, this mechanism of injury has been previously described in the literature. However, we are unaware of cases reporting multiple separate incidents involving the same patient and animal. We present this case to highlight the perils of untrained pet ownership in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and the importance of prompt medical and surgical treatment of injuries.

### Human rabies in China [^11321pW2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Most of the human patients were infected with rabies through dog bites. The number of dogs in China has increased gradually since the late 1970s. Currently, approximately 70% of households in Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Hunan — where the most cases have been recorded in recent years — own more than one dog (data not shown). However, the rate of dog vaccination remains insufficient.

The rabies epidemics in China since 1950 may be partially explained by dog population dynamics. The first major epidemic subsided at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, coinciding with a pet reduction policy. The second major epidemic peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when economic reforms were initiated in China, and the dog population increased dramatically. Population immunity may also play a role in these cyclic epidemics. However, neither the dramatic decline in rabies cases in the early part of the 1990s nor the initiation of the third epidemic around the turn of the millennium can be simply explained by dog population dynamics. Other factors may include untimely and inappropriate post-exposure treatment and the existence of healthy carrier dogs.

Wounds of 118 of 178 patients were not treated; 60 patients washed the wounds with soap and water. A total of 129 (72%) patients did not receive the vaccine. Of the remaining 49 (28%) patients, 35 received vaccination in a timely manner. Two of the 178 patients received antirabies serum intramuscularly. Among the 49 patients who received post-exposure vaccination, 30 did not complete the immunization requirements. Healthy carriers have been detected, and rabies virus has been isolated from them.

### Mycobacterium marinum infection after iguana bite in Costa Rica [^115regL8]. Emerging infectious diseases (2023). High credibility.

Zoonotic infections associated with animal bite injuries are common and can result in severe illness. Approximately 5 million animal bites occur annually in North America, and 10 million injuries occur globally from dog bites alone. Pathogens causing infections after dog or cat bites are well described; pathogens from other animal bites are less well defined, although their oral microbiota are known. We report a case of cutaneous Mycobacterium marinum infection after an iguana bite to inform clinicians of potential infectious etiologies of lizard bites.

A previously healthy 3-year-old girl was on vacation with her family in Costa Rica. She was eating cake on the beach when an iguana approached her. While attempting to take the cake, the animal bit the dorsum of her left hand. She was immediately taken to a local clinic and found to have a single, superficial bite wound over the dorsum of her third metacarpal. The wound was immediately disinfected and irrigated; she was prescribed a 5-day course of oral amoxicillin. The family returned to the United States after the incident. Her wound completely resolved over the ensuing days without immediate complications.

Five months after the bite, her parents noted a small lump on the dorsum of her left hand that was not present previously. The child was otherwise well. The lump became progressively larger, erythematous, and mildly painful over the next 3 months (Figure, panel A). Because of persistent symptoms, her parents sought medical attention at Stanford Medicine Children's Health (Stanford, California, USA).

### Dog and cat bites to the hand: Treatment and cost assessment [^116ShkzW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the demographic patterns, clinical morbidity, and treatment costs associated with domestic animal bites to the hand, a retrospective review was conducted on 111 patients who suffered either a dog or cat bite to the hand. Demographic data were collected for both the patient and the animal involved.

The patient population had suffered 71 dog bites and 40 cat bites. Two scenarios were identified that increased the likelihood of a bite: attempting to separate fighting animals and attempting to aid an injured animal. More than half of the victims (61 of 111) were bitten by an animal with which they were familiar. Bite injuries ranged from relatively minor wounds to major injuries, including open fractures, persistent deep infection such as osteomyelitis, nerve laceration, tendon laceration, or tissue loss.

Approximately two-thirds of patients required hospital admission at least for intravenous antibiotics. Roughly one-third of animal bite victims required at least one surgical procedure. Thirteen patients required long-term intravenous antibiotics and/or multiple surgeries, incurring medical expenses in excess of $77,000.

Domestic animal bites to the hand are common injuries that can produce considerable morbidity. Stray animals did not account for the majority of incidents. Bite prevention strategies should focus on the careful handling of animals that are fighting or injured. Animal bite wounds often require intravenous antibiotics and hospitalization, and the cost of care for deep infections can be enormous.

### Sepsis-induced purpura fulminans caused by Pasteurella multocida [^111q3mxx]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old man was admitted with a cutaneous rash associated with septic shock and multiorgan failure, six days following a dog bite. He was started on empiric antibiotherapy and supportive measures. The patient's condition worsened, necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation and intermittent haemodialysis. The rash evolved from petechiae-like lesions to purpura and gangrene, ultimately requiring bilateral lower limb amputation. Blood cultures revealed only Pasteurella multocida after 10 days of incubation. P. multocida infection is a rare cause of soft tissue infection that generally resolves with oral antibiotherapy. Infections causing sepsis are rare and usually occur in immunocompromised patients. Purpura fulminans induced by sepsis is a rare, life-threatening disorder that should be recognized promptly to enable early treatment. We found no case reports of purpura fulminans caused by Pasteurella infections in our literature review.

### DOG bite transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to a human [^112fxmHK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the community is increasing, and companion animals serve as a potential reservoir for such bacteria. This report describes a case of a companion dog that was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics for a chronic illness and transmitted multidrug-resistant bacteria to a human through a bite.

### Dog and cat bites: Rapid evidence review [^114HTnXm]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for animal bites, particularly concerning wound care, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend referring patients with injuries to underlying structures, such as tendons, joints, and bones, as well as injuries that could lead to scarring, for possible surgical exploration and repair.

### Gastric perforation following a DOG attack [^115CnY98]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Dog bites are a major cause of injury, especially in the pediatric population. Common anatomic sites of dog bites on children are the peripheries and the head and neck. The torso is reportedly injured less frequently, and only two cases of intra-abdominal injury secondary to dog bites have been reported. We recently encountered a 3-year-old boy presenting with peritonitis who had sustained multiple dog bites to his trunk and upper limbs.

Emergency laparotomy was performed, and surgical findings revealed penetration of the peritoneum and a single perforation of the anterior gastric wall with multiple tooth marks. Consequently, the gastric perforation was debrided and repaired. After receiving rabies prophylaxis and amoxicillin-clavulanate, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.

- **Principles of management**:
	- Debridement of wounds and use of prophylactic antibiotics are crucial.
	- Because rabies is always fatal, postexposure prophylaxis should be considered in appropriate cases.

Dog bites can be life-threatening, and prevention is the best approach to solving this problem. Clinicians need to be aware that some dog bites can be devastating and should be familiar with the principles of managing these wounds.

### Mycotic aneurysm following a DOG bite: The value of the clinical history and molecular diagnostics [^113j2ktD]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old Caucasian taxi driver presented with a 3-week history of malaise, night sweats, a 7 kg weight loss, generalized arthralgia, and persistent mid-lower abdominal pain. Blood inflammatory markers were raised, and a computed tomography scan demonstrated an irregular degeneration of the infrarenal aorta, with a differential diagnosis including aortic infection. An urgent type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair was performed with a rifampicin-soaked aortic tube graft during an open procedure. No organisms were grown from multiple peripheral blood cultures or culture of the affected aorta.

However, subsequent 16S ribosomal polymerase chain reaction analysis of the resected aorta identified Capnocytophaga canimorsus as the causative organism, a commensal that lives in the mouth of dogs and cats. The patient subsequently gave a history of multiple bites from his pet dog over recent months, the likely source of infection. He was treated with 8 weeks of intravenous antibiotics before switching to oral antibiotics for an additional 6 weeks.

### Rabies: changing prophylaxis and new insights in pathophysiology [^111xUegf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in decoding disease mechanisms, rabies remains one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. To achieve the elimination of human rabies deaths by 2030, feasible and affordable post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must be made available, with expansion to rural areas in rabies-endemic countries. Vaccination and population control of dogs, which are the principal reservoirs and transmitters, must be conducted in concert.

Recent advances have been made in understanding rabies neuropathogenesis and pathophysiology. These include experimental findings on host- and virus-specific mechanisms mediating neuronal survival, which explain clinical differences between furious and paralytic rabies. The forthcoming World Health Organization guide on rabies, based on data from pathogenesis and immunization mechanisms with support from clinical evidence, introduces new accelerated one-week intradermal PrEP and PEP schedules. The use of rabies immunoglobulin injected into the wound is endorsed at amounts that do not exceed doses interfering with active immunization. Potential therapeutics, designed in line with rabies neuro-pathophysiology, appear promising.

Clinical practice and rabies awareness can be enhanced through transboundary collaboration across various regions. Advances in prophylaxis and perspectives on animal control offer a promising path to conquer rabies by 2030.

### Control of rabies as a victim of its own success: Perception of risk within a Latin American population [^113YH1rS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Of the zoonotic diseases that afflict humans, rabies is among the most well-known, having been described for at least four millennia. Historically, in the urban environment, dogs have been responsible for maintaining the disease and are the primary source of transmission to humans. During the 1980s, Latin America was affected by hundreds of human cases of rabies. Although there is no cure, timely care through immunization of people exposed to rabies is one of the key tools for its prevention. This measure, combined with vaccination campaigns targeting the canine population, sensitive and active epidemiological surveillance, and awareness and education of the population, forms the basis of disease control and elimination programs in the region. Additionally, the population's knowledge and perception of the disease is another determining factor for disease control. As a result, Latin America has achieved a reduction of 95% in the incidence of human rabies. Gradually, like other diseases that have been successfully eliminated, rabies has become less relevant and lately neglected.

After an exposure, an individual must seek primary health care to receive guidance on rabies, to have a wound treated, and to receive postexposure immunization, which prevents the development of the disease. Therefore, because it is a disease with straightforward, effective prevention, rabies control is seen as a parameter to measure the quality of health services.

### Rabies acquired through mucosal exposure, China, 2013 [^11222K4o]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Rabies, caused by the rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus), is a zoonotic encephalitis with a mortality rate of almost 100%. Although rare in industrialized countries because of mandatory vaccination of dogs and other domestic pets, rabies frequently occurs in developing countries. In industrialized countries, the virus is transmitted to humans mostly by contact with wild animals; in developing countries, by dog bites.

We report a fatal case of rabies in a man who had sucked the wounds of his son who had been bitten by a stray dog. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review committees of the Second Hospital of Nanjing and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, China, and was performed in accordance with the ethics standards in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's son.

The patient was a 41-year-old man from a village in northern Jiangsu Province, China. On August 19, 2013, the man's 17-year-old son was bitten on the left leg by a stray dog, leaving bleeding wounds on the lower part of the gastrocnemius muscles. Because of concern about rabies, the man and other family members immediately washed the boy's wounds with water, and the man's neighbors killed and buried the stray dog. While washing his son's wounds, the man made a dramatic scene by crouching down to suck "toxic blood" from his son's wounds and spitting out the blood several times. He then sent his son to a local hospital, where the physicians immediately (within 1 hour after the dog bite) cleaned the wounds.

### Rabies: Relevance, prevention, and management in travel medicine [^113iEr35]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease transmitted only in mammals. Terrestrial rabies, predominantly transmitted by dogs, is the most significant rabies cycle threatening humans. The causative neurotropic virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. This genus contains several rabies-related viruses, all of which are known or suspected to cause rabies-like diseases. Transmission occurs when the virus enters through the skin or mucosa following bites, scratches, or preexisting injuries contaminated by the saliva of an infected mammal. Only 51 human rabies cases that have not been transmitted by animal bites have been described.

### Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome acquired through DOG bite, South Korea [^112c866x]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

This case underscores the importance of personal protective equipment and infection control in both veterinary and human healthcare settings to prevent zoonotic transmission. Prompt wound care after animal bites or scratches, including washing with soap and running water for more than 20 minutes, can reduce the risk of infections such as B virus or rabies. Although the effectiveness of this approach against SFTS is unproven, the same principle may reduce the risk of other viral infections transmitted through animal bites or saliva exposure.

In conclusion, this case emphasizes the risk of SFTSV transmission not only via tick bites but also directly through bites from infected dogs. Enhanced awareness and preventive strategies in both veterinary and human healthcare settings are critical to mitigating the risks of SFTS.

### Dog and cat bites: Rapid evidence review [^114wZCqa]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for animal bites, more specifically in wound care, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend considering primary closure at the time of injury for dog bite wounds that are at low risk of infection. Wounds at risk of infection should be allowed to heal by secondary intention.

### Camel bites: A case study with a summary of current epidemiology, injury patterns, and treatment modalities [^115S4bVS]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Animal bites are a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, the majority of animal bites come from domestic pets, including dogs, cats, and rodents. Camel bites, on the other hand, are exceedingly rare in the United States and are poorly described in the western medical literature. Special considerations must be made when camel bite injuries occur, as they may be therapeutically challenging. Although some clinical features of camel bites resemble those of more common animal bite injuries, the camel's unique dentition and bite force must be taken into account when managing these wounds.

### Rabies re-examined [^117XmJvT]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Rabies is an acute, progressive, incurable viral encephalitis. The causative agents are neurotropic RNA viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. Mammalian reservoirs include the Carnivora and Chiroptera, but rabid dogs still pose the greatest hazard worldwide. Viral transmission occurs mainly via animal bite, and once the virus is deposited in peripheral wounds, centripetal passage occurs towards the central nervous system. After viral replication, there is centrifugal spread to major exit portals, the salivary glands. The epidemiological significance of any host "carrier" state remains highly speculative. Although incubation periods average 1–3 months, disease occurrence days or years after exposure has been documented.

Rabies should be suspected in patients with a concomitant history of animal bite and traditional clinical presentation, but a lack of such clues makes antemortem diagnosis a challenge. Pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood, and care entails palliative measures only. Medical emphasis relies heavily on prevention of exposure and intervention before clinical onset. Prophylaxis encompasses thorough wound treatment, vaccine administration, and inoculation of rabies immunoglobulin.

Although it is a major zoonosis, canine rabies can be eliminated, and application of new vaccine technologies permits significant disease control among wildlife species. Nevertheless, despite much technical progress in the past century, rabies is a disease of neglect and presents a modern public health conundrum.

### Control of rabies as a victim of its own success: Perception of risk within a Latin American population [^112apW8y]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Another important issue addressed is the extent of potential exposure to the rabies virus. In this sense, two crucial points are studied and discussed: the higher rate of dog bites in the peri-urban environment, and how epidemiological surveillance should look more at this phenomenon. Among those who work with rabies, it is said that when a case occurs, we are facing a lost battle because the infectious event that culminated in the occurrence of the disease occurred weeks before. Therefore, health systems should pay more attention to the transmission of the disease via dog bites.

The population should be more aware of the need to report dog bites and to seek timely care when potential exposures happen. The number of dog bites could serve as indicators to measure variations in the canine population size, determine the amount of immunobiologicals needed for postexposure prophylaxis, and assess the level of rabies awareness in the population. In peri-urban areas specifically, a higher rate of bites was observed than in urban areas. As pointed out in the study, there may be many reasons for this discrepancy. In particular, the peri-urban environment provides better conditions for maintaining a large dog population that is neglected by people, thus allowing more infectious contacts between dogs and people and creating an enabling environment for the rabies virus to survive and continue circulating.

Cases of rabies in humans are not reported in Arequipa, indicating some success in measures to prevent the disease, despite various difficulties in primary health systems.

### Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by a Pasteurella dagmatis-like isolate originating from a patient's cat [^1124kZW1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Pasteurella species are part of the oral flora of cats and dogs. In humans, they are frequently found in infected animal bite wounds, but invasive infections are rare. This is the first report of prosthetic-valve endocarditis with a Pasteurella dagmatis-like species, which originated from the patient's cat.

### Microvascular replantation following facial DOG bites in children: Systematic review and management algorithm [^1114168M]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Pediatric dog bite injuries account for 1% of emergency department visits per year and represent an underrecognized and underreported public health problem. Reconstructive surgery is frequently utilized, and in the most extreme injuries, microvascular replantation may be considered. We sought to systematically review the available literature on microvascular replantation after facial dog bite injuries in children, with particular attention to perioperative morbidity and long-term follow-up.

- **Methods**: We reviewed a case of microvascular replantation following a facial dog bite injury in a child from our own institution and conducted a systematic literature search to identify other similar reports. Clinical variables were collected from the reported cases, and descriptive statistics were calculated. A management algorithm was developed from the reviewed published experience.

- **Results**: We report the youngest child at the time of writing in the literature to undergo replantation following a facial dog bite injury. Nineteen other cases were found involving children aged 18 months to 17 years, with follow-up ranging from 2 weeks to 28 years. Anastomosis techniques varied considerably and included both an artery and vein in only 9 (47%) of 19 cases. Venous congestion was nearly universal, and multimodal techniques were used until native venous outflow was reestablished. Blood transfusion was common, but intensive care unit utilization was not frequently reported. Long-term outcomes were excellent, with growth of the replanted part and recovery of function; however, minor revision procedures were occasionally necessary.

### Dog and cat bites [^111CjnYD]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Animal bites account for 1% of all emergency department visits in the United States and more than $50 million in healthcare costs per year. Most animal bites are from a dog, usually one known to the victim. Children are the most common victims of dog bites. Bite wounds should be cleaned and copiously irrigated with normal saline using a 20-mL or larger syringe or a 20-gauge catheter attached to the syringe. The wound should be explored for tendon or bone involvement and possible foreign bodies.

Wounds may be closed if cosmetically favorable, such as those on the face or gaping wounds. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered, especially if there is a high risk of infection, such as with cat bites, puncture wounds, wounds to the hand, and in persons who are immunosuppressed. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is the first-line prophylactic antibiotic. The need for rabies prophylaxis should be addressed with any animal bite because even domestic animals are often unvaccinated. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis consists of immune globulin at presentation and vaccination on days 0, 3, 7, and 14.

Counseling patients and families about animal safety may help decrease animal bites. In most states, physicians are required by law to report animal bites.

### The association of antimicrobial prophylaxis with return visits after DOG bites in children [^114sVmbA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

Dog bites occur frequently in the United States, yet there are no clear guidelines for prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis in healthy children following a dog bite. The aim of this study was to assess antibiotic prophylaxis and subsequent rates of infection after dog bites in children. It was hypothesized that there is a negative association between prophylactic prescription of any antimicrobial and return visits within 14 days for infection.

In this retrospective cohort study, the frequency of antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed after dog bite injuries in patients aged 0 to 18 years and subsequent return visits for infection were assessed using 2016 to 2017 medical and pharmacy claims derived from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases. The International Classification of Diseases-10 code W54 for dog bites was used, followed by keyword searches to find diagnoses (including infection), wound descriptions, and medications.

Over the 2-year period, 22,911 patients were seen for dog bites that were not coded as infected. The majority, 13,043 (56.9%), were prescribed an antibiotic at the initial visit, while 9868 (43.1%) were not. Of those prescribed antibiotics, 98 (0.75%; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.90) returned with an infection, compared with 59 (0.60%; 95% CI, 0.44–0.75) of those not prescribed antibiotics. Receiving an antibiotic prescription at the initial visit was associated with a reduced rate of return for wound infections only among children whose wounds were repaired or closed. Children not receiving a prescription whose wounds were repaired were more than twice as likely to return with an infection.

### Epidemiology, socioeconomic analysis, and specialist involvement in DOG bite wounds in adults [^113Nbw89]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Dog bites have been well described and characterized in the pediatric population. Comparatively, dog-bite injuries in adults and the settings in which surgeons become involved are less studied. An electronic hospital database identified all patients 18 years or older who were treated for dog bites from 2010 to 2014. Demographics, injury information, intervention type, and payer source were collected. Socioeconomic analysis was performed using Geographic Information Systems mapping.

A total of 189 adults presented to the emergency department with dog-bite-related injuries. The most common injury location was the hand (n = 62, 32.8%), followed by the head and neck (n = 36, 19.1%). Of the 189 patients, 33 adults (17.5%) were forwarded to a surgical subspecialist for repair. A head and neck injury was significantly more likely to be repaired by a surgical specialist (P = 0.011). The most common breed of dog identified was pit bull (n = 29, 47.5%). The majority of pit bull attacks involved the extremities (65.5%) compared to other breeds of dogs.

Pit bull victims were noted to have a lower average annual income compared to other breed victims ($64,708 versus $75,004; P = 0.16). Annual income between intervention group and no intervention group was not significantly different (P = 0.26). This study is the first to perform a socioeconomic analysis in the adult dog-bite population and encourages the use of a surgical specialist in the setting of a head and neck bite.

### Human pasteurellosis health risk for elderly persons living with companion animals [^113gydtT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Most injuries (74.6%) in the localized-infection group were attributed to animal bites. Scratch wounds caused by cats were recorded in 12 patients; however, some of them had simultaneous bite injuries. Six cases of cat-associated injury were observed in women 21–30 years of age. In the same age group of male patients (3 patients), none had animal contact. Differences in the distribution of various Pasteurella spp. between localized and invasive infections could not be detected.

- **Distribution of various Pasteurella species**: Analysis conducted in Szeged, Hungary, from 2002 to 2015.

When we compared data about hospitalization in patients with localized and invasive infections, we found 71 (62.3%) of 114 patients with localized infections had hospitalizations; the average length of stay was 8 days (range 1–30 days). In the invasive-infection group, 40 of 48 patients (83.3%) were hospitalized, and the average length of hospital stay was 12.7 days (range 1–60 days). Patients with invasive infections were more frequently hospitalized than patients with localized infections (χ² = 5.999, df = 1, p = 0.014), and the average length of stay among patients with invasive pasteurellosis was also longer.

- **Hospital admission comparison**: Hospital admission was almost the same in patients with dog bites (68.3%) and in patients with cat-induced injury (64.2%). The average length of hospital stay was longer (11 days [range 1–60 days]) in cases of dog bites than in cases of cat bites or scratches (8.3 days [range 3–41 days]). In patients with localized infections, injuries affected mostly the upper extremities.

### Modification of the 1-phosphate group during biosynthesis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus lipid A [^117BSAme]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

We have previously characterized the lipid A structure of Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a bacterial species that can cause rare but severe sepsis or meningitis in humans after dog bites or scratches. This bacterium belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae in the phylum Bacteroidetes and is a usual member of a dog's mouth flora.

Lipid A consists of a 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-D-glucose (GlcN3N′) β-(1′→6)-linked to 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (GlcN) [β-D-GlcpN3N′-(1→6)-D-GlcpN lipid A hybrid backbone], containing a phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) group attached to the C-1 reducing end and lacking a 4′-phosphate. The structure includes 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoic acid [i 17:0(3-OH)], 3-hydroxy-13-methyltetradecanoic acid [i 15:0(3-OH)], 3-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-15-methylhexadecanoic acid [i 17:0(3-O(i 15:0))], and 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid [16:0(3-OH)], attached to the backbone at positions 2, 3, 2′, and 3′, respectively.

This structure differs from that of a potent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist like Escherichia coli lipid A, which consists of a β-(1′→6)-linked GlcN disaccharide phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′ and carries four (R)-3-hydroxymyristate chains [14:0(3-OH)] at positions 2′, 3′, 2, and 3. The 2′ and 3′ 3-hydroxylated acyl groups in GlcN(II) are further esterified with laurate and myristate, respectively.

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: Evaluation and management [^111qxQys]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Due to specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and the organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity.

Human and animal bites most commonly lead to polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, and Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals. Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound.

Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require débridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

### Pediatric DOG bites: A review of 1422 cases treated at a level one regional pediatric trauma center [^115LbDj5]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Children under the age of 14 account for over 40% of the almost 900,000 annual hospital visits associated with dog bites. Care for dog bites ranges from simple wound irrigation to complex surgical reconstruction. Due to a number of factors, children frequently sustain dog bites to highly vulnerable regions, often necessitating intervention by plastic surgeons.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study analyzed data from the 1422 pediatric patients who sustained dog bites and presented to the Le Bonheur Children's Hospital Emergency Room from January 2011 to May 2017.

- **Results**: The typical pediatric dog bite case was male (63.5%), African-American (57.4%), and less than 10 years old (69.4%). The head and neck were the most commonly affected areas (64.7%). Of the head and neck regions, the cheeks and lips were the most frequently injured structures (34.5%). Hospital admission was required for 188 patients (13.2%), and operative repair was deemed necessary in 16.9% of all cases. Of the patients requiring inpatient operative repair, most (78.3%) were discharged in less than 24 hours. Operative complications occurred in 5.8% of all cases, with infections accounting for the majority (92.9%). No fatal dog bites occurred in this study.

- **Conclusions**: Age, bite location, and number of bites sustained are several factors of significance, which may aid the novice plastic surgeon in identifying which pediatric dog bite cases will require surgical intervention.

### Dog and cat bites: Rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to healthcare systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush injuries and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds.

Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, whereas adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g. pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection.

Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is a low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Role of oral rabies vaccines in the elimination of DOG-mediated human rabies deaths [^111hPJDS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Domestic dogs are responsible for nearly all the approximately 59,000 global human rabies deaths that occur annually. Numerous control measures have successfully eliminated dog-mediated human rabies deaths in upper-income countries. These measures include dog population management, parenteral dog vaccination programs, access to human rabies vaccines, and education programs for bite prevention and wound treatment. Implementing these techniques in resource-poor settings can be challenging; perhaps the greatest challenge is maintaining adequate herd immunity in free-roaming dog populations.

Oral rabies vaccines have been a cornerstone in the elimination of rabies virus from wildlife populations; however, they have never been effectively used to control dog-mediated rabies. Here, we convey the perspectives of the World Organisation for Animal Health Rabies Reference Laboratory Directors, the World Organisation for Animal Health expert committee on dog rabies control, and the World Health Organization regarding the role oral vaccines play for dogs. We also issue recommendations for overcoming hesitations to the expedited field use of appropriate oral vaccines.

### Bite injuries among vaccination staff participating in a mass canine rabies vaccination campaign, Haiti 2016–2017 [^112vNKgS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Elimination of dog-transmitted human rabies worldwide will require large-scale dog vaccination campaigns. However, this places participating vaccinators at increased risk. Data from the 2016–2017 Haitian mass rabies vaccination campaign was analyzed to determine dog bite incidence among vaccinators. A survey was then developed for completion by all identifiable bitten vaccinators covering demographics, experience and training, bite episode details, attitudes toward dogs and rabies, and medical care. A parallel group of unbitten vaccinators was also surveyed.

Dog bite incidence was 0.03% (43/127,000) of all dogs vaccinated. The capture, vaccinate, and release method of vaccination carried a significantly higher risk of dog bite (0.35%, 6/1,739 vaccinations) than other methods (P < 0.001). Twenty-seven bitten vaccinators and 54 control vaccinators were included in the survey analysis. No differences were found between groups in demographics, experience, or training. However, bitten vaccinators were significantly more likely than the control group to have experienced a dog bite before the study period (P < 0.001). This may be associated with a lesser appreciation of dogs, and/or a poorer ability to interpret dog behavioral signals within this group.

Although 98% of the control group indicated they would seek medical care for a dog bite, only 35% of bitten vaccinators sought such care. On a yearly basis, for the Haitian campaign, a full series of post-exposure rabies vaccinations for all bite victims would prove more cost-effective than pre-exposure vaccination of all.

### Inactivation of human coagulation factor X by a protease of the pathogen Capnocytophaga canimorsus [^112GXniK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus causes severe dog bite-related bloodstream infections. We investigated if C. canimorsus contributes to bleeding abnormalities during infection. The C. canimorsus protease CcDPP7 causes factor X dysfunction by N-terminal cleavage. CcDPP7 inhibits coagulation in vivo, which could promote immune evasion and trigger hemorrhage.

- **Summary**:

- **Background**: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacterium present in the oral flora of dogs and causes fulminant sepsis in humans who have been bitten, licked, or scratched. In patients, bleeding abnormalities, such as petechiae, purpura fulminans, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur frequently.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether C. canimorsus could actively contribute to these bleeding abnormalities.

- **Methods**: Calibrated automated thrombogram and clotting time assays were performed to assess the anticoagulant activity of C. canimorsus 5 (Cc5), a strain isolated from a fatal human infection. Clotting factor activities were measured with factor-deficient plasma. Factor X cleavage was monitored with the radiolabeled zymogen and western blotting. Mutagenesis of Cc5 genes encoding putative serine proteases was performed to identify the protease that cleaves FX. Protein purification was performed with affinity chromatography. Edman degradation allowed the detection of N-terminal cleavage of FX. Tail bleeding times were measured in mice.

- **Results**: We found that Cc5 inhibited thrombin generation and increased the prothrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time of human plasma.

### Escape from immune surveillance by Capnocytophaga canimorsus [^1142ffV6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from dogs' mouths, can cause septicemia or meningitis in humans through bites or scratches. Here, we describe and characterize the inflammatory response of human and mouse macrophages upon C. canimorsus infection. Macrophages infected with 10 different strains failed to release tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 alpha. Macrophages infected with live and heat-killed (HK) C. canimorsus 5 (Cc5), a strain isolated from a patient with fatal septicemia, did not release IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and nitric oxide (NO). This absence of a proinflammatory response was characterized by the inability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 to respond to Cc5.

Moreover, live but not HK Cc5 blocked the release of TNF-alpha and NO induced by HK Yersinia enterocolitica. Additionally, live Cc5 down-regulated the expression of TLR4 and dephosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results highlight passive and active mechanisms of immune evasion by C. canimorsus, which may explain its capacity to escape from the host immune system.

### Puzzling encounter of idiopathic Pasteurella bacteraemia [^115cAVcZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative coccobacillus commonly transmitted through animal bites, including those from cats and dogs. The degree of infection can be particularly concerning in immunosuppressed populations, with a notable correlation in patients with cirrhosis. Despite this, only 13 cases of P. multocida bacteraemia have been documented, most of which involved patients with cirrhotic liver disease and multiple comorbidities. Here, we present a case involving an elderly patient with a pertinent medical history of mixed hyperlipidaemia, who presented following a mechanical fall with acute renal failure and septic shock secondary to P. multocida bacteraemia.

### Emergence of rabies among vaccinated humans in India: a public health concern [^114CzMHo]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

A choropleth map (Fig. 1) illustrates dog-bite cases in the states and Union Territories of India between January and October 2022, as reported by local media. The map was created using QGIS 3.26.3, with the base layer sourced from the Survey of India.

Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease. India currently adheres to the updated Thai Red Cross Schedule for intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) vaccination. The regimen for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) includes eight ID doses (two sites per visit on days 0, 3, 7, and 28) or five IM doses on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Improper or non-administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) or poor wound management can allow more time for the virus to spread. Despite receiving the proper PEP, an unfortunate outcome might occur. Once the vaccine is administered, the body's production of antibodies competes with the virus's potential to reach the brain. It has been suggested that in cases where body parts rich in nerves or close to the brain are affected, the vaccine may not have sufficient time to act. Hence, the vaccine alone is insufficient to prevent rabies in category III exposure, and RIG must be promptly administered to provide passive immunity. There have also been rare instances of cold chain failure and substandard or fake vaccines documented.

In Kerala, rabies deaths among vaccinated individuals were attributed to the nature of wounds and failure to seek prompt care. Awareness about first aid measures after an animal bite in the country is inadequate. A survey conducted in six Indian states revealed that only 38% of animal bite victims reported washing wounds after being bitten.

### New insights into the transmissibility of Leishmania infantum from dogs to sand flies: Experimental vector-transmission reveals persistent parasite depots at bite sites [^112a2g6Y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The relative contribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs in propagating *L. infantum* in vector populations, the backbone of maintaining ZVL foci, remains unclear. Skin lesions observed in symptomatic dogs have been associated with the ability to transmit *L. infantum* back to the sand fly population. However, the significance of intact skin in transmission to sand flies is less clear. By use of xenodiagnoses, some studies concluded that only symptomatic dogs act as reservoirs and that only a small proportion of dogs with high skin parasite loads, correlated to more severe disease, are infectious to sand flies. In contrast, other studies showed that both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs were infectious to sand flies.

In one study, *L. infantum* was isolated from intact skin of 78.7% of seropositive dogs, of which only 21.9% were classified as symptomatic. By use of xenodiagnoses, another study detected parasites by polymerase chain reaction analysis in sand flies fed on asymptomatic dogs. Unfortunately, CanL studies suffer from a lack of consistency in the definition of asymptomatic dogs, which may have factored in the contradictory conclusions reported above. Since examination of the bite sites in naturally infected dogs is not possible, skin at the site of infected bites has never been considered as a source of parasites or as a contributor to the cycle of parasite transmission between dog and sand fly.

Here, we report that experimental vector transmission of CanL by *Lutzomyia longipalpis*, the natural vector of *L. infantum*, reveals long-term persistence of the parasite.

### Pasteurella multocida urinary tract infection in a pediatric patient with end-stage renal disease [^111ofpx6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacillus that is part of the normal oral flora of cats and dogs. Most infections involving P. multocida are soft tissue infections following animal bites or scratches. We present a case of P. multocida urinary tract infection in a 13-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis. He was successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam, followed by oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. Thirteen additional cases of P. multocida urinary tract infection (12 adults and one pediatric patient) reported in the literature were reviewed. Underlying medical illnesses and structural urologic abnormalities are risk factors.

### Human pasteurellosis health risk for elderly persons living with companion animals [^1153v47K]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Pasteurella spp. infections can cause various diseases in wild and domestic animals. In humans, most infections are associated with cat or dog bites, licks, and scratches. Annually, in the United States, approximately 300,000 visits to emergency departments are recorded for animal bites or scratch wounds; however, not all of these are associated with infections. Regarding animal bites, 3%–18% of dog bites and 28%–80% of cat bites become infected. Fifty percent of dog bites and 75% of cat bites are associated with the presence of Pasteurella multocida, which can be frequently detected as part of the oral microbiota in various animals such as cats, dogs, pigs, and various wild animals.

Data about injuries associated with animal bites or scratches in Hungary are not available; however, rabies vaccines are given to more than 4,000 patients annually (4,784 in 2017). This number mainly represents cases in which the animal could not be observed after an accident or injury. Of the 35,000 traumatic injury cases (such as various injuries from accidents, bites, scratches, sport injuries, falls, and injuries that occur at home) that are recorded annually at our university hospital in Szeged, Hungary, 14–37 (0.04%–0.1%) are associated with animal bites or scratches.

### Role of oral rabies vaccines in the elimination of DOG-mediated human rabies deaths [^113fdRQF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Domestic dogs are responsible for nearly all the 59,000 global human rabies deaths that occur annually. Various control measures have been successful at eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths in upper-income countries, including dog population management, parenteral dog vaccination programs, access to human rabies vaccines, and education programs for bite prevention and wound treatment. Implementing these techniques in resource-poor settings can be challenging. Perhaps the greatest challenge is maintaining adequate herd immunity in free-roaming dog populations.

Oral rabies vaccines have been a cornerstone in rabies virus elimination from wildlife populations. However, oral vaccines have never been effectively used to control dog-mediated rabies. Here, we convey the perspectives of the World Organisation for Animal Health Rabies Reference Laboratory Directors, the World Organisation for Animal Health expert committee on dog rabies control, and the World Health Organization regarding the role of oral vaccines for dogs. We also issue recommendations for overcoming hesitations to expedited field use of appropriate oral vaccines.

### Zoonoses of dermatologic interest [^11746kau]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Zoonoses are infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Transmission occurs directly or through vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, or flies. The causative agents include bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi. Domestic pets and livestock, as well as wild animals, can be sources of disease. This summary focuses on dermatologically relevant examples.

### Utilization of imaging in the management of pediatric DOG bites [^116528DJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that imaging is overused in the initial workup of dog bite patients. To reduce radiation exposure, we aim to determine which circumstances surrounding dog bites, patient population, and injury patterns would necessitate imaging studies for management.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed on all patients presenting with dog bites to our Level I pediatric trauma center between 2013 and 2015. Data collected included circumstances surrounding the injury, patient demographics, injuries, and imaging studies performed. Our analysis focused on maxillofacial and head CT scans, and plain radiographic studies of the limbs, hands, and feet. Imaging studies were considered positive if there was evidence of bony injury.

- **Results**: We identified 615 patients with dog bites, with 114 patients having had at least one imaging study performed (a total of 145 imaging studies to analyze). Only 13 (11%) patients had a positive study. In the CT scan group, 6 (22.2%) of 27 studies were positive. In the plain radiographic group, 7 (5.9%) of 118 studies were positive.

- **Conclusions**: Our review indicates that imaging studies are overused in the initial workup of these patients, and the majority of these studies are negative. This study confirms that it is feasible to institute guidelines for ordering imaging studies in dog bite patients. This will ultimately reduce radiation exposure and the cost of care for these injuries.

### Vaccinating children in high-endemic rabies regions: What are we waiting for [^113dWUqy]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

On September 28 this year, World Rabies Day served as a reminder that a fully preventable viral encephalitis still claims at least 59,000 victims per year in over 150 countries, particularly in rural Africa and Asia where over 40% of individuals bitten by a suspect rabid animal are children. Sadly, these figures are likely underestimated.

Rabies is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) identified by the WHO. This group comprises diverse communicable diseases that predominantly affect poor populations lacking adequate sanitation and living in close contact with infectious vectors. In 2013, the World Health Assembly called for intensified measures against NTDs. In 2015, the WHO called for action to achieve zero dog-mediated rabies deaths in humans by 2030. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance prevention, diagnosis, control, and treatment through an integrated One Health approach. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a rabies vaccine plays an important role in prevention but is almost unavailable in high-endemic settings.

### Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome acquired through DOG bite, South Korea [^111DwJ1R]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

A veterinary technician in South Korea contracted severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus from a dog bite. Molecular evidence, including PCR sequencing, supports dog-to-human transmission. The case underscores the zoonotic risks posed by companion animals and highlights the importance of preventive measures.

### Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Pasteurella dagmatis, Germany [^116kV4AP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pasteurella spp. are gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacteria that are part of the oral flora of domestic animals, including cats and dogs. In cases of animal bites, Pasteurella spp. bacteria can be culturally detected in 50%-75% of cases. Infections are typically caused by Pasteurella multocida; however, P. dagmatis is rarely isolated from wounds, and severe P. dagmatis infections are exceedingly uncommon or unreported. Few cases of infective endocarditis (IE) attributable to P. dagmatis bacteria have been reported in the English-language literature. We report an additional case in a man in Germany. Given the rarity of gram-negative non-HACEK endocarditis (caused by species other than Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, or Kingella) and the unfavorable prognosis associated with it, case reports are essential to improve the management of affected patients.

An 81-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with a fever of up to 39.3°C. He reported a weight loss of 10 kg during the preceding month. Vital signs and physical examination revealed no relevant pathologies. A domestic cat bite on the foot 2 months before admission was the only potential source of infection, but the wound had already healed weeks prior. Underlying medical conditions included a mechanical aortic valve implanted 20 years previously due to a combined vitium.

After obtaining a set of blood cultures, we administered empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam. Results of chest ra

### Bite injuries among vaccination staff participating in a mass canine rabies vaccination campaign, Haiti 2016–2017 [^1153GecW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). High credibility.

Elimination of dog-transmitted human rabies worldwide will require large-scale dog vaccination campaigns. However, this places participating vaccinators at increased risk. Data from the 2016–2017 Haitian mass rabies vaccination campaign were analyzed to determine dog bite incidence among vaccinators. A survey was developed for completion by all identifiable bitten vaccinators, covering demographics, experience and training, bite episode details, attitudes toward dogs and rabies, and medical care. A parallel group of unbitten vaccinators was also surveyed. Dog bite incidence was 0.03% (43/127,000) of all dogs vaccinated. The capture, vaccinate, and release method of vaccination carried a significantly higher risk of dog bite (0.35%, 6/1,739 vaccinations) than other methods (P < 0.001).

Twenty-seven bitten vaccinators and 54 control vaccinators were included in the survey analysis. No differences were found between groups in demographics, experience, or training. However, bitten vaccinators were significantly more likely than the control group to have experienced a dog bite before the study period (P < 0.001). This may be associated with a lesser appreciation of dogs, and/or a poorer ability to interpret dog behavioral signals within this group. Although 98% of the control group indicated they would seek medical care for a dog bite, only 35% of bitten vaccinators sought such care. On a yearly basis, for the Haitian campaign, a full series of postexposure rabies vaccinations for all bite victims would prove more cost-effective than preexposure vaccination of all vaccinators.

### Canine-to-human transmission of Mycoplasma canis in the central nervous system [^117Y5AUL]. Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

Dog bites remain a common occurrence in society, particularly affecting toddlers and small children under the age of 2. Injuries to the head and face, more prevalent in younger children, often lead to significant morbidity. Additionally, standardized post-dog bite injury management continues to lack consensus. Here, we present the only reported pediatric case in the literature of Mycoplasma canis-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection in an 11-month-old infant who sustained a dog bite to the calvarium.

In one particular pediatric emergency department in Colorado, the prevalence of dog bites tripled during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic following stay-at-home orders. This observation, paired with advances in microbiological identification like MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer), may lead to the identification of future cases where uniquely canine pathogens play a role in human infection.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^1169mWXG]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common issue, accounting for approximately 0.1% of attendances to emergency medicine departments. The morbidities associated with these injuries are numerous. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection at the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3,136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one incident every three days!

- **Demographics and management**: The majority of those bitten were young males, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1, and 44% were in the age group of 16 to 25 years. The management of these wounds was found to be poor. Seventeen percent of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover, while 21% either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered. Additionally, 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered.

- **Consequences and recommendations**: This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis for infectious agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that these findings will be replicated in other centers. In view of the inadequacies highlighted by this study, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of human bites. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Capnocytophaga canimorsus: an emerging pathogen in immunocompetent patients-experience from an emergency department [^113NQwQ3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a bacterium of the normal oral flora of dogs and cats. Human infection is caused by animal bites but is rarely observed, mainly in immunocompromised patients. We present two cases of C. canimorsus infection that occurred in immunocompetent patients, causing multiorgan failure and severe neurologic involvement in both cases.

- **Case report**: In the first case, we discuss a 69-year-old immunocompetent woman with septic shock derived from a skin and soft tissue infection following a dog's bite. She developed ischemic necrosis evolving into gangrene of both forefeet and hands, infective aortic endocarditis, and neurologic involvement caused by large hemispheric hypodense lesions compatible with ischemic septic lesions. In the second case, we present a 65-year-old immunocompetent man with meningitis following a dog's bite. Despite antibiotic therapy, he developed neurologic clinical deterioration, with right sensitive hemisyndrome associated with a lack of strength and motor skills in the right hand. Radiologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of cerebritis.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Clinicians should always be aware of this pathogen, both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, and consider prophylactic antibiotics after exposure.

### Postoperative wound infection after primary closure in pediatric DOG bite injuries [^1155C9Di]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend three to five days of antibiotic prophylaxis after dog bite injury, but variation exists in clinical practice after primary closure of wounds. The purpose of this study was to analyze antibiotic duration and incidence of infection during a study period in which an institutional protocol limiting post-repair antibiotics to a maximum of three days was implemented.

- **Methods**: Dog bite injuries that underwent primary closure in patients aged ≤ 18 years were retrospectively identified from 2018 to 2022 at a level 1 pediatric trauma center. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Protocol compliance and a short course of antibiotics were defined as ≤ 3 days of antibiotics. Multivariable regression analysis for variables associated with wound infection was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 455 injuries were included for analysis. After protocol implementation, the mean antibiotic duration decreased from 6.8 to 4.4 days (P < 0.001). Post-repair follow-up data were available for 235 (51.6%) cases in the cohort. Multivariable logistic regression identified superficial wounds and anatomic injury location to be significantly associated with wound infection. Shorter antibiotic duration was not associated with increased risk of wound infection on regression analysis, and there was no difference in postoperative wound infection rate between short-course and long-course groups (7.5% versus 7.1%, P = 0.912).

- **Conclusions**: Standardization of postoperative antibiotic duration was associated with a decrease in antibiotic duration without an increase in the incidence of wound infections after closure of wounds.

### Animal-related injuries in a resource-limited setting: Experiences from a tertiary health institution in northwestern Tanzania [^111RV4cW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In our study, dog bite was the most common cause of injuries and commonly affected children more than adults. This finding is in agreement with several studies that indicated dogs as the primary animal species implicated in animal-related injuries, ranging from 63–80%, but contrary to other studies which reported that equestrian traumas are common. Higher dog attacks in children are thought to be attributable to their size and the proximity of their face to the dogs' mouth, and these attacks are generally related to the children's interaction with the dog, possibly provoking the attack.

Given the proximity of our northwestern Tanzania hospital to Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, and the Serengeti National Park, one would expect a large number of injuries resulting from aquatic and wild animals. The low rate of injuries from aquatic and wild animals in our study can be explained by the fact that the majority of patients sustaining these severe injuries may have died before reaching the Accident and Emergency department. These animals can produce severe injuries by grasping victims with their powerful jaws and dragging them underwater, where they roll while crushing their prey.

In keeping with other studies, the majority of injuries in the present study were in the lower and upper limbs. Attempts at using the foot and hand to avoid animal bites may be the possible reason for these parts being affected more. Another thought is that animals may find it easier to attack moving body parts.

The type of wounds in injuries resulting from animal attacks can range from minor bruises to more severe forms.

### Bite injuries among vaccination staff participating in a mass canine rabies vaccination campaign, Haiti 2016–2017 [^116Zj3MF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

As dog vaccination efforts further intensify across the world, striving toward "Zero by 30", more vaccinators will be needed. A single vaccinator can encounter thousands of unfamiliar animals during a campaign, each presenting a risk of bite injury and rabies exposure. There is little, if any, information available as to the incidence of dog bite injury to vaccinators during a mass vaccination campaign, the factors that might mitigate this risk, or the cost of bite treatments incurred by the campaign. This study was conducted during a national vaccination campaign in Haiti to ascertain the rate of dog bite injuries to vaccinators, examine the healthcare-seeking behavior of bite victims, and investigate risk factors for bite injuries in an effort to develop planning and safety guidelines in the context of future mass dog vaccination campaigns.

### Bites (mammalian) [^1112RfdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Mammalian bites are usually caused by dogs, cats, or humans and are more prevalent in children (especially boys) than in adults. Animal bites are typically caused by the person's pet and, in children, frequently involve the face. Human bites often occur in children as a result of playing or fighting, while in adults, they are usually the result of physical or sexual abuse. Mixed aerobe and anaerobe infection is the most common type of infection and can occur in up to half of human bites.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent complications of mammalian bites? What are the effects of treatments for infected mammalian bites? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found five systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic prophylaxis (human bites, non-human bites), antibiotics, debridement, decontamination, and irrigation.

### Low-incidence, high-consequence pathogens [^112kt874]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Rabies, one of the oldest known infectious diseases, is nearly 100% fatal and continues to cause tens of thousands of human deaths globally. Canine rabies has been eliminated in North America and many South American and European countries, but it is still the source of most human rabies cases in other areas, primarily in many African and Asian countries. Urbanization and lack of aggressive rabies elimination programs may have contributed to the resurgence of canine rabies–associated human deaths in several provinces in China. In the United States, the number of human deaths from rabies has declined to an average of 3 cases per year during the last several decades. Apart from a few imported canine rabies cases, most human cases in the United States resulted primarily from bat rabies virus variants. Nonetheless, suspected or confirmed human exposures in the United States result in tens of thousands of postexposure prophylaxis regimens every year.
