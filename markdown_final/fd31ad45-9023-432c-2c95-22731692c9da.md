## Question

What are the treatments for in hospital VT prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about in-hospital ventricular tachycardia prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and scope of "prophylaxis" versus treatment. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine prophylactic antiarrhythmics in acute coronary syndromes. Next, I will examine the evidence for beta-blockers as the cornerstone and any exceptions. After that, I need to check electrolyte and ischemia management as foundational measures. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like torsades de pointes, perioperative settings, and VT storm, and close with a practical, risk-stratified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "In-hospital VT prophylaxis" generally refers to preventing ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in patients at risk, particularly during acute coronary syndromes or in the early post–myocardial infarction period, and it is distinct from treating established VT/VF or from long-term secondary prevention with devices or ablation, so I need to keep the time window and intent clear as I proceed [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c].

> Wait, let me verify the bottom line on routine prophylactic antiarrhythmics. Contemporary AHA/ACC/HRS guidance issues a Class III recommendation against prophylactic lidocaine or high-dose amiodarone for VT prevention in suspected acute myocardial infarction, reflecting harm signals and lack of benefit, so routine prophylaxis with these drugs is not advised in ACS [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c] [^a23fba26].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the rationale. Historical data show that while lidocaine may reduce early ventricular fibrillation, it is associated with increased mortality, and a randomized trial of high-dose amiodarone in the early post-MI period also showed higher mortality, whereas moderate-dose amiodarone was not superior to placebo, which explains the strong recommendation against routine prophylaxis in this setting [^ccccf27c] [^427405ea].

> I need to ensure I anchor the positive strategy correctly. Beta-blockers are the cornerstone for in-hospital VT/VF prophylaxis in ACS and recent MI, with multiple guidelines emphasizing their mortality benefit and reduction in ventricular arrhythmias; they are first-line unless contraindicated, and early use is beneficial when hemodynamics allow, though caution is warranted in patients at high risk for cardiogenic shock [^1d939bf9] [^7e3a6871] [^0462e58b].

> Let me consider the strength of evidence and any nuances. Meta-analytic data in AMI show beta-blockers reduce mortality, and in recurrent polymorphic VT/VF after MI, beta-blockers improve survival, reinforcing their role as the primary pharmacologic prophylaxis; however, in patients with shock risk features, early beta-blockade can worsen outcomes, so timing and hemodynamic stability must guide initiation and titration [^0462e58b] [^7e3a6871].

> Next, I should review foundational measures that reduce VT/VF risk without antiarrhythmic prophylaxis. Aggressive correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia is recommended, and prompt recognition and treatment of myocardial ischemia with revascularization when indicated are key, because ischemia is a major precipitant of early VT/VF in ACS and addressing it reduces arrhythmic risk [^427405ea] [^5e111416].

> But wait, what if the arrhythmia phenotype is torsades de pointes rather than ischemic VT/VF. I should double-check that torsades requires a different prophylactic approach: remove QT-prolonging drugs, correct potassium to around 4.5–5.0 mmol/L, give intravenous magnesium irrespective of baseline magnesium, and consider temporary overdrive pacing for pause-dependent triggers; this is a distinct prophylaxis pathway and should not be conflated with ischemic VT/VF prevention [^b64cd846] [^53f4edcb] [^ed946d80].

> I will now examine special contexts where "prophylaxis" is sometimes discussed. In perioperative cardiothoracic surgery, some centers use prophylactic amiodarone to reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias, and observational implementation studies suggest reductions in ventricular tachycardia when bundled with beta-blockers and statins; however, this is not universal and should be individualized given heterogeneity in evidence and patient risk profiles [^d9e6f7c2].

> Let me reconsider whether any antiarrhythmic has a role in acute-phase prophylaxis. ESC 2022 allows consideration of IV lidocaine for recurrent polymorphic VT/VF that is refractory to beta-blockers or amiodarone, or when amiodarone is contraindicated, but this is treatment of established arrhythmia rather than routine prophylaxis, so it does not overturn the principle of avoiding routine prophylactic antiarrhythmics in ACS [^59235d60].

> I should confirm the practical, risk-stratified approach. For most ACS patients, prioritize beta-blockade when hemodynamically tolerated, correct electrolytes promptly, and pursue ischemia-directed therapy and revascularization; avoid routine lidocaine or high-dose amiodarone for prophylaxis, and reserve antiarrhythmics for treatment of documented VT/VF or specific phenotypes like torsades, aligning with Class I and III recommendations from major guidelines [^1d939bf9] [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: there is no approved pharmacologic prophylaxis for in-hospital VT in ACS beyond beta-blockers and correction of reversible causes; routine lidocaine or high-dose amiodarone prophylaxis is discouraged due to harm, whereas beta-blockers, electrolyte optimization, and ischemia management are the evidence-based pillars to mitigate VT/VF risk during hospitalization [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c] [^1d939bf9].

---

Routine prophylaxis for in-hospital VT is **not recommended** [^58a927f9]; instead, management focuses on **correcting reversible causes** and using **beta-blockers** for high-risk patients [^1d939bf9]. Prophylactic lidocaine or amiodarone is discouraged due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^ccccf27c] [^a23fba26]. For patients with recurrent or incessant VT/VF, consider IV amiodarone [^bd037702], procainamide [^de7427de], or lidocaine [^59235d60] based on clinical context, and reserve catheter ablation for refractory cases [^324a3a92]. Continuous ECG monitoring, electrolyte correction, and ischemia management are essential [^53f4edcb] [^5e111416].

---

## General principles of VT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients

- **Identify and correct reversible causes**: Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), myocardial ischemia, and medication-induced proarrhythmia are common precipitants of VT [^427405ea] [^5e111416].

- **Continuous ECG monitoring**: Essential in high-risk patients to detect early VT and initiate prompt management [^53f4edcb].

- **Electrolyte management**: Maintain potassium ≥ 4.0 mEq/L and magnesium ≥ 2.0 mg/dL to reduce VT risk [^b64cd846].

## Pharmacological interventions

### Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are **first-line therapy** for VT prophylaxis in patients with structural heart disease, heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction (MI) [^1d939bf9]. They reduce sympathetic activity, myocardial oxygen demand, and arrhythmogenesis [^notfound]. Use is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, severe bronchospastic disease, or cardiogenic shock.

---

### Antiarrhythmic medications

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Amiodarone | - Recurrent VT/VF <br/> - VT storm <br/> - Refractory arrhythmias | - Class I for recurrent VT/VF [^bd037702] <br/> - Class IIa for VT storm [^6bc2a0c1] |
| Procainamide | - Stable monomorphic VT <br/> - Refractory arrhythmias | - Class IIa for stable monomorphic VT [^6f572027] <br/> - Alternative to amiodarone [^notfound] |
| Lidocaine | - VT associated with acute ischemia <br/> - Refractory VT/VF | - Class IIa for ischemic VT [^c98e566f] <br/> - Alternative when amiodarone is contraindicated [^59235d60] |

---

Prophylactic use of lidocaine or amiodarone in the absence of documented VT/VF is **not recommended** due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)

ICDs are indicated for **secondary prevention** in patients who have survived cardiac arrest or have sustained VT/VF [^9b3558cd]. They are also indicated for **primary prevention** in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) due to ischemic heart disease, provided meaningful survival > 1 year is expected [^ee5c50b9].

---

### Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is recommended for patients with **recurrent VT** despite antiarrhythmic therapy or as an alternative to long-term antiarrhythmic therapy [^324a3a92]. It is particularly effective in patients with ischemic heart disease and scar-related VT [^878db48e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**: Beta-blockers are recommended for VT prophylaxis. Prophylactic lidocaine or amiodarone is not recommended [^58a927f9] [^ccccf27c].

- **Heart failure**: Beta-blockers are first-line therapy. Amiodarone or sotalol may be considered for recurrent VT/VF despite beta-blocker therapy [^1d939bf9] [^6b6beb3a].

- **Post-operative patients**: Beta-blockers are recommended for VT prophylaxis, particularly in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery [^d9e6f7c2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Beta-blockers for patients with structural heart disease, heart failure, or recent MI [^1d939bf9].

- **Second-line therapy**: Amiodarone, procainamide, or lidocaine for recurrent or refractory VT/VF [^79cb1148] [^59235d60].

- **Non-pharmacological therapy**: ICD implantation for secondary prevention and selected primary prevention cases; catheter ablation for refractory VT [^9b3558cd] [^324a3a92].

- **Routine prophylaxis**: Not recommended in the absence of documented VT/VF [^58a927f9].

---

In-hospital VT prophylaxis centers on **correcting reversible causes**, using **beta-blockers** for high-risk patients, and reserving antiarrhythmics and invasive therapies for recurrent or refractory VT/VF.

Cardiac arrest medications and wide QRS complex tachycardia—key evidence and cautions are as follows: High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV versus a standard 1 mg) has been studied and, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation, improved survival to hospital admission but did not improve survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival; vasopressin is no longer recommended in advanced cardiovascular life support algorithms. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit in 2 randomized controlled trials for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2 to 4 g IV magnesium did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient cardiac arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge; exceptions include marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which IV magnesium is warranted. For prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, routine lidocaine or procainamide was associated with increased mortality while beta blockers were associated with a significantly lower mortality; an RCT of 1073 patients found high-dose amiodarone led to higher mortality, and a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For stable wide QRS tachycardia, differentiation between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often possible by history and the 12-lead ECG; patients with wide QRS tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have VT until proven otherwise, and verapamil given to a patient with VT may cause severe hypotension or syncope except in verapamil-sensitive VT (intrafascicular reentry) in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize initially.

Arrhythmias associated with acute coronary syndromes (ACS)—For recommendations, see Section 7.1 and current ACLS guidelines; ACS can give rise to a life-threatening arrhythmia that may be the first manifestation of ischemia; ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been reported in up to 20% of acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs); the incidence of VF occurring within 48 h of ACS onset may be decreasing with aggressive revascularization and increased beta-blocker use; early VF in ACS is associated with increased hospital mortality but not increased long-term mortality; prophylaxis with lidocaine may reduce VF but appears associated with increased mortality and has largely been abandoned; use of prophylactic beta blockers reduces VF and is encouraged when appropriate, and correction of hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia is encouraged.

Drugs that cause TdP: incidence interpretation and prescribing guidance indicate uncertainty in attribution and emphasize individualized risk–benefit decisions. The proportion of sudden arrhythmic deaths that are due to TdP is unclear because few individuals are being monitored at the time of death, and when TdP occurs in outpatient settings first responders are likely to observe ventricular fibrillation, making it impossible to determine whether ventricular fibrillation was preceded by QT prolongation and then TdP. Use of a QT-prolonging drug must be based on risk-benefit analysis in individual patients, and where efficacy of alternatives is equivalent, the non–QT-prolonging agent should be preferred; where benefit clearly outweighs risk, QT prolongation should not limit necessary therapy. The only class of drugs for which reasonable TdP incidence data are available is the antiarrhythmic agents.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia—High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

Hospital treatment of sustained torsade de pointes (TdP)—acute interventions and dosing: “For patients with TdP that does not terminate spontaneously or that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation, immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed.” For episodes in patients on QT‑prolonging drugs with prolonged QT, “intravenous magnesium sulfate is reasonable … (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B),” with dosing that “Magnesium sulfate 2 g can be infused intravenously as a first-line agent … irrespective of the serum magnesium level,” and “repeat infusions of magnesium sulfate 2 g” if needed. To prevent pause‑dependent triggers, temporary transvenous pacing may be used “at rates >70 beats per minute.” “Replacement of potassium to supratherapeutic levels of 4.5 to 5.0 mmol/L may also be considered,” though evidence is limited “(Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C).”

### Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (out-of-hospital cardiac arrests) [^31a7b662]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2006). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are the main causes of sudden cardiac death, but other ventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur without haemodynamic compromise. Ventricular arrhythmias occur mainly as a result of myocardial ischaemia or cardiomyopathies, so risk factors are those of cardiovascular disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antiarrhythmic drug treatments and defibrillation for use in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest associated with shock-resistant ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation? What are the effects of antiarrhythmic drug treatments for use in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest associated with shock-resistant ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bretylium, lidocaine, amiodarone, procainamide, and defibrillation.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^53f4edcb]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) prevention in hospital settings—among patients who receive QT-prolonging drugs in hospital units with continuous ECG monitoring, TdP should be avoidable if there is an awareness of individual risk factors and the ECG signs of drug-induced LQTS. Key ECG risk factors include marked QT prolongation to >500 ms (with the exception of amiodarone- or verapamil-induced QT prolongation), marked QT-U prolongation and distortion after a pause, onset of ventricular ectopy and couplets, macroscopic T-wave alternans, or episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that are initiated with a short-long-short R-R cycle sequence (typically, PVC–compensatory pause–PVC). Recognition of these ECG harbingers of TdP allows for treatment with intravenous magnesium, removal of the offending agent, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities and other exacerbating factors, including the prevention of bradycardia and long pauses with temporary pacing if necessary.

### Hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine as a treatment choice or prophylaxis for COVID-19 at the primary care level in developing countries: a primum non nocere dilemma [^4ce58088]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned against the use of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital or a clinical trial setting due to the risk of QT interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia and the increased risk of these complications when combined with some antibiotics such as azithromycin. Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic. In order to solve this bioethical problem, we strongly recommend that a randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting be carried out as a matter of urgency in these areas of the world.

In suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), prophylactic lidocaine or high‑dose amiodarone for prevention of VT is potentially harmful (Class III: Harm, Level B‑R). In wide QRS complex tachycardia of unknown origin, calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) are potentially harmful (Class III: Harm, Level C‑LD).

### The rise and fall of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [^0891a9b9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1. 
Number of active registered trials investigating hydroxychloroquine by date among patient populations of prophylaxis, outpatient, and hospitalized settings.

As trial registrations grew, observational study reports also emerged. These findings were generated nearly exclusively from studies among hospitalized populations, often in single hospital settings, and reported widely heterogeneous results. – Some of these studies demonstrated a clinical benefit for the use of HCQ/CQ, whereas others showed no difference to placebo or standard of care.These observational studies also raised concern for cardiotoxic harm associated with the use of HCQ.By May 2020, as published results among hospitalized patients from predominantly Asian countries began to appear, it became clear that the evidence for HCQ as a treatment of COVID-19 was inconsistent and contradictory.Among the first 12 reports evaluating the efficacy of HCQ using both observational studies and clinical trials, in a combined sample of 3,543 hospitalized patients, there was no clear evidence to support continued use of this drug for hospitalized patient populations.

The narrative on HCQ/CQ importantly shifted in May 2020 when the Lancet published and then retracted a study reporting no benefits of HCQ/CQ, after revelations surfaced that the authors’ study conclusions were based on unsubstantiated data.The study alleged to report on 96,032 patients across 671 hospitals worldwide and showed an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia with treatment with HCQ. Although retracted, the messaging about associated risk of cardiac events, specifically extended QT intervals, led researchers, clinicians, and trial funders to become more skeptical of the safety and toxicity of HCQ.This had a dramatic effect on the number of new HCQ trials registrations (Figure 1) from April 2020 onward and resulted in trial funding abruptly ending and study ethics approvals rescinded for some of the largest planned HCQ trials.

Metabolic and inflammatory conditions—scope of evidence is outlined as follows: Although these disorders are important causes of life‑threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the occurrence of VT/SCD is relatively rare with few trial data to guide management; data on prevention are even more sparse, all recommendations in this section therefore have Level of Evidence B or C, and acute emergencies should be managed conventionally.

### Ischemic ventricular arrhythmias: experimental models and their clinical relevance [^f03739d1]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

In the United States, sudden cardiac death accounts for an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 cases each year, with 80,000 presenting as the first manifestation of a preexisting, sometimes unrecognized, coronary artery disease. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)-induced ventricular fibrillation frequently occurs without warning, often leading to death within minutes in patients who do not receive prompt medical attention. Identification of patients at risk for AMI-induced lethal ventricular arrhythmias remains an unmet medical need. Recent studies suggest that a genetic predisposition may significantly contribute to the vulnerability of the ischemic myocardium to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Numerous experimental models have been developed for the purpose of advancing our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the development of cardiac arrhythmias in the setting of ischemia and with the aim of identifying antiarrhythmic therapies that could be of clinical benefit. While our understanding of the mechanisms underlying AMI-induced ventricular arrhythmias is coming into better focus, the risk stratification of patients with AMI remains a major challenge. This review briefly discusses our current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of ischemic ventricular arrhythmias and their temporal distribution as revealed by available experimental models, how these correlate with the clinical syndromes, as well as prospective prophylactic therapies for the prevention and treatment of ischemia-induced life-threatening arrhythmias.

Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute coronary syndromes—timing and risk are characterized: Life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring during the first 24 to 48 h of myocardial infarction (MI) do not imply continuing risk over time, although follow-up after in-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been reported to carry an adverse prognosis over the ensuing 6 mo and later in-hospital VF has been associated with long-term risk. Patients presenting with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are at increased long-term risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and the clinician’s ability to recognize individuals with reversible or transient causes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias is limited.

ACC/AHA/HRS methodology notes for class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) clarify usage and comparative-effectiveness requirements. “COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE).” “A recommendation with LOE C does not imply that the recommendation is weak,” and when RCTs are unavailable, “there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.” The “outcome or result of the intervention should be specified,” and for comparative effectiveness “(COR I and IIa; LOE A and B only),” supporting studies “should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated.” The evidence quality process “is evolving,” with incorporation of an Evidence Review Committee.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator—Several prospective multicenter clinical trials have documented improved survival with ICD therapy in high-risk patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction (MI) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and ICD therapy, compared with conventional or traditional antiarrhythmic drug therapy, has been associated with mortality reductions from 23% to 55% depending on the risk group participating in the trial, with the improvement in survival due almost exclusively to a reduction in SCD; the trials may be subcategorized into 2 types: primary prevention (prophylactic) trials in which the subjects have not experienced a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia or a symptomatic equivalent and secondary prevention trials involving subjects who have had an abortive cardiac arrest, a life-threatening VT, or unexplained syncope with work-up suggesting a high probability that a ventricular tachyarrhythmia was the cause of the syncope.

Sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) epidemiology—Out-of-hospital burden is large, with the total annual out-of-hospital cardiac arrests estimated at 356 500, and an additional 209 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests annually. Among out-of-hospital events, approximately 357 000 trigger emergency response, with 97% occurring in adults >18 years of age. Survival remains low: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has an estimated 10% overall survival rate; 70% occur in the home where survival is 6%; and survival to hospital discharge after in-hospital cardiac arrest is estimated to be 24%. Across settings, survival is better when initial rhythms are shockable (ventricular fibrillation [VF], pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VT]) compared with pulseless electrical activity or asystole.

VT and VF during acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are common around myocardial infarction (MI), with >50% of out-of-hospital arrests showing significant coronary lesions on acute angiography; among hospitalized MI patients, 5% to 10% have ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) prior to presentation and another 5% after arrival, most within 48 hours of admission. In non–ST-elevation ACS undergoing catheterization within 48 hours, VT/VF occurred in 7.6% of patients, with 60% within 48 hours of admission. In ST-segment elevation MI cohorts, 11.6% had VF prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in a selected primary PCI trial, 5.7% developed sustained VT or VF with 90% within 48 hours from the procedure. VT or VF at any time was associated with a substantially higher risk of death within 90 days, and late VT or VF (after 48 hours of hospital presentation) was associated with a higher risk of death than early VT or VF (within 48 hours of hospital presentation).

### Comparison of warfarin with direct oral anticoagulants for thromboembolic prophylaxis after catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia [^05630113]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thromboembolic events after catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) can result in significant morbidity. Thromboembolic prophylaxis after catheter ablation can be achieved by the use of antiplatelet agents, vitamin K antagonists, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The relative safety and efficacy of these modes of prophylaxis are uncertain. We sought to compare the outcomes of patients who received warfarin or DOACs for thromboembolic prophylaxis after catheter ablation of VT.

Methods and Results

Anticoagulation with DOACS was started after left ventricular VT ablation in a series of 42 consecutive patients with structural heart disease (67±11 years, 3 women, ejection fraction 32±14%). Duration of hospital stay, bleeding episodes, and thromboembolic events were compared to a historic consecutive group of patients (n=38, 65±13 years, 14 women, ejection fraction 36±13%) in whom anticoagulation with a formerly described protocol of heparin and vitamin K antagonist was used after VT ablation procedures. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the group where DOACs were used as compared to vitamin K antagonists (3.3±1.8 vs. 5.0±2.5 days postablation; p=0.001) without an increase of bleeding or thromboembolic events.

Conclusion

Anticoagulation with DOACs is safe and shortens hospital stay in patients with structural heart disease undergoing left ventricular VT ablation procedures.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^ed946d80]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF scientific statement on prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings—Cardiac arrest due to torsade de pointes (TdP) in acquired drug-induced long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is described as “a rare but potentially catastrophic event in hospital settings.” Administration of a QT‑prolonging drug to hospitalized patients “may be more likely to cause TdP” than in outpatients because hospitalized patients often have additional risk factors, including being “elderly people with underlying heart disease” and having “renal or hepatic dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, or bradycardia,” with possible rapid intravenous administration. In units with continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs), “the possibility of TdP may be anticipated by the detection of an increasing QT interval and other premonitory ECG signs of impending arrhythmia,” after which “it then becomes possible to discontinue the culprit drug and manage concomitant provocative conditions (eg, hypokalemia, bradyarrhythmias) to reduce the occurrence of cardiac arrest.” The statement “is to raise awareness among those who care for patients in hospital units about the risk, ECG monitoring, and management of drug-induced LQTS” and reviews “methods to monitor QT intervals in hospital settings, and immediate management of marked QT prolongation and TdP.” The term torsade de pointes “was coined by Dessertenne in 1966” as “a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a pattern of twisting points,” with a typical ECG feature being “a change in the amplitude and morphology (twisting) of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line.”

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the member of the writing committee.

### Amiodarone versus other pharmacological interventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death [^bc85935b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two main strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICD.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention in SCD compared with placebo or no intervention or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from a cardiac arrest or a syncope due to Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular Fibrillation, or VT/VF (secondary prevention).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO) and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention we considered participants recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular arrhythmias.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. We contacted trial authors for missing data. We performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three studies included more than one comparison.

Main Results

We included 24 studies (9,997 participants). Seventeen studies evaluated amiodarone for primary prevention and six for secondary prevention. Only three studies used an ICD concomitantly with amiodarone for the comparison (all of them for secondary prevention).For primary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (17 studies, 8383 participants) reduced SCD (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), cardiac mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00). The quality of the evidence was low.Compared to other antiarrhythmics (three studies, 540 participants), amiodarone reduced SCD (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), cardiac mortality (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.86) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76). The quality of the evidence was moderate.For secondary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (two studies, 440 participants) appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 4.32; 95% CI 0.87 to 21.49) and all-cause mortality (RR 3.05; 1.33 to 7.01). However, the quality of the evidence was very low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (four studies, 839 participants) amiodarone appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.52; very low quality of evidence), but there was no effect in all-cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.42; low quality evidence).Amiodarone was associated with an increase in pulmonary and thyroid adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low to moderate quality evidence that amiodarone reduces SCD, cardiac and all-cause mortality when compared to placebo or no intervention for primary prevention, and its effects are superior to other antiarrhythmics.It is uncertain if amiodarone reduces or increases SCD and mortality for secondary prevention because the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Antithrombotic therapy practices in US hospitals in an era of practice guidelines (...) [^1bb558fd]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Venous thromboembolism prevention in orthopedic surgery. Mean ± SD duration of inpatient postprocedure anticoagulation therapy and patients discharged from the hospital with anticoagulation therapy for 358 patients who underwent total knee replacement, 284 who underwent total hip replacement, and 291 who underwent hip fracture repair. We established a national multicenter database for hospitals to assess the patient characteristics, risk factors, and treatment of individuals with or at risk for thrombotic disease. Primary thrombosis prevention was evaluated in patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and in those requiring total knee replacement, total hip replacement, or hip fracture repair. Secondary prevention was evaluated in patients diagnosed as having AMI, deep vein thrombosis, or PE.

Despite substantial evidence that risk-modifying therapy and appropriate treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality from thrombosis, these findings indicate that there is an important opportunity for improving the primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic disease. Our results demonstrate that an unacceptable number of patients with high-risk AF, orthopedic surgery, AMI, or DVT or PE did not receive adequate prophylaxis or treatment. Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin provide effective prophylaxis for orthopedic surgery and are recommended in guidelines. 25, 26 However, even when administered for 7 to 10 days after surgery, the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT remains at 15% for patients with THR and 30% for. those with TKR. 27 Several studies suggest that the risk of DVT may persist for up to 2 months after THR surgery, 26-30 and prophylaxis for up to 28 to 35 days has been recommended in the THR and hip fracture surgery setting. 26 Although our data are limited in that.

We observed that a large proportion of patients with DVT or PE had their hospital discharge delayed until parenteral therapy was discontinued. Only one-fourth were discharged with bridge therapy. The success of outpatient treatment programs demonstrates that DVT may often be safely managed outside the hospital. 35-38 The mean reduction in LOS was 4. 1 days for those discharged with bridge therapy. The low rate of referral to anticoagulation management clinics may have affected the hospital discharge decision. Our results point to a potential economic benefit in the treatment of DVT in the outpatient setting.

Transient arrhythmias of reversible cause—Class I recommendations: “1. Myocardial revascularization should be performed, when appropriate, to reduce the risk of SCD in patients experiencing cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT in the setting of acute ischemia or MI. (Level of Evidence: C) 2. Unless electrolyte abnormalities are proved to be the cause, survivors of cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT in whom electrolyte abnormalities are discovered in general should be evaluated and treated in a manner similar to that of cardiac arrest without electrolyte abnormalities. (Level of Evidence: C) 3. Patients who experience sustained monomorphic VT in the presence of antiarrhythmic drugs or electrolyte abnormalities should be evaluated and treated in a manner similar to that of patients with VT without electrolyte abnormalities or antiarrhythmic drugs.” These directives apply to ventricular fibrillation (VF), polymorphic and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and myocardial infarction (MI) contexts when reversible causes are present or suspected.

### Mortality implications of appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in secondary prevention patients: contrasting mortality in primary prevention patients from a prospective population-based registry [^7fc0eead]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our study with a larger number of patients and a longer follow‐up in a real‐world setting provides clinicians caring for ICD patients information that could potentially benefit them if strategies could be developed to mitigate the increased risk.

Clinical Implications

The clinical implications of our study are as follows. The first implication is that prophylaxis of shocks and ATP by recommending a strategy that mitigates the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with ICDs may have mortality implications. Two randomized trials have evaluated the effect of prophylactic ventricular tachycardia catheter ablation as an addition to ICD in the ischemic cardiomyopathy population. 20, 21 Although the findings of those trials cannot be extrapolated to our population, one could hypothesize that decreasing the burden of shocks or delaying the appearance of ventricular arrhythmia could translate into a better survival. The second clinical implication of our study is that patients presenting with an appropriate shock or ATP whether they received an automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator for primary or secondary indication has mortality implications. It is a novel finding that there is increased mortality both in primary and secondary prevention even in patients with a less severe cardiomyopathy in terms of LV dysfunction but with greater probability of therapy in the secondary prevention group. Consideration for advanced heart failure therapies or antiarrhythmic drugs or ventricular tachycardia ablation should be taken and optimization of heart function treatment should be done accordingly.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline—evidence for intravenous lidocaine in cardiac arrest and VT/VF: Intravenous lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic medication of long-standing and widespread familiarity, but compared with no antiarrhythmic medication, lidocaine did not consistently increase a return of spontaneous circulation after defibrillation and was not associated with improvement in survival to hospital discharge. In prospective, blinded, RCTs, lidocaine was less effective than amiodarone in improving hospital admission rates after out-of hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory VF or polymorphic VT; but there were no differences between the 2 medications in survival to hospital discharge. However, in the subset of patients with witnessed SCA due to initial shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT, a subgroup analysis showed that survival to hospital discharge with lidocaine was better than with placebo.

### Real-world characteristics and readmissions among patients undergoing ablation for ventricular tachycardia: a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured patients in the USA [^bc1a0781]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for 25% of the 17 million cardiovascular disease-related deaths annually worldwide.Ventricular tachycardia (VT) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a frequent cause of SCD.Management of VT is a multipronged approach which includes treatments with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD/CRT-D) and catheter ablation.Use of AADs in combination with/without ICDs is currently considered as the standard of care for the management of VT, with some limitations.AADs have not demonstrated effectiveness as primary management for VT, with the exception of beta-blockers.Additionally, AADs have limited use in the prevention of recurrent VT due to their toxicity and poor efficacy.Although ICD is considered an effective option in terminating VT episodes, and is associated with mortality reduction and improved survival among high-risk patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, the painful shocks can adversely impact patient’s quality of life.Catheter ablation is an effective treatment option for VT, and has been shown in randomised multicentre trials to reduce subsequent ICD shocks and VT episodes, as well as prevent recurrences at 6 months among patients with ischaemic heart disease.Furthermore, ablation has been found to be significantly better in prolonging time to first recurrence of any VT or VF as prophylactic therapy prior to ICD placement than ICD only.

Although clinical trials and observational studies have provided evidence in favour of ablation in terms of VT outcomes, most of the studies have primarily focused on patients with ischaemic VT, with relatively little information available on outcomes associated with ablation among patients with non-ischaemic VT.The primary objective of this study was to examine the characteristics and outcomes including complications and inpatient readmissions among commercially insured patients in the USA undergoing ablation for ischaemic or non-ischaemic VT.

Ventricular tachycardia with normal or near-normal LVEF—device versus drug therapy: Recurrent sustained VT is usually treated by management of underlying causes and antiarrhythmic drugs, but the use of antiarrhythmic agents may predispose the patient to proarrhythmic complications that might pose significant threats to life. Increasingly, the ICD is being used effectively to avoid the relative ineffectiveness and adverse complications of pharmaceutical therapy; in monomorphic VT, antitachycardia pacing is often applied successfully without provocation of untoward symptoms, whereas polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may require shock therapy. Overall, the strategy of using devices to manage such arrhythmias appears to be clinically successful, although expensive.

Surgery and revascularization for ischemia-related ventricular arrhythmias—myocardial ischemia is a cause of sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), and revascularization is an effective treatment to prevent myocardial ischemia; in life-threatening VA, observational studies show that patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) had substantially better survival after accounting for other predictors, the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) appears comparable for patients with complex ischemic heart disease randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus CABG, and for those with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ischemic heart disease amenable to CABG, the risk of SCD is lower with CABG than medical therapy; however, revascularization alone is usually insufficient to prevent recurrence of sustained monomorphic VT, and further evaluation for inducible VT is generally considered if ventricular function is depressed and/or scar is present.

Class IIb states that intravenous lidocaine may be reasonable for treatment of polymorphic VT specifically associated with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction (Level of Evidence: C).

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia after prior myocardial infarction—mechanism and revascularization: Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of prior myocardial infarction (MI) is typically due to scar-related reentry and is not due to acute ischemia, and although it may be appropriate to recommend revascularization when another indication exists, revascularization alone is unlikely to reduce the recurrence of monomorphic VT and specific therapies such as antiarrhythmic medications or ablation may be needed to prevent recurrence.

### Management of ventricular arrhythmias Worldwide: comparison of the latest ESC, AHA / ACC / HRS, and CCS / CHRS guidelines [^e23d3257]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A new guideline for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death has been published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Beside the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) guideline and the 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CCS/CHRS) position statement, this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice. As these recommendations are periodically updated integrating the latest scientific evidence, there are similarities in many aspects. Nevertheless, notable differences in the recommendations can be found resulting from different scopes and publication years, differences in data selection, interpretation, and weighing, and regional factors such as differing drug availability. The aim of this paper is to compare specific recommendations to identify differences while acknowledging the commonalities and to provide an overview of the status of current recommendations with a special emphasis on gaps in evidence and future directions of research. Overall, the recent ESC guideline places a greater emphasis on the value of cardiac magnetic resonance, genetic testing in cardiomyopathies and arrhythmia syndromes, and the use of risk calculators for risk stratification. Further significant differences can be found regarding diagnostic criteria for genetic arrhythmia syndromes, the management of hemodynamically well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia, and primary preventive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.

Beta blockers—effects in ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD): Beta blockers reduce all-cause mortality and SCD in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and in polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction (MI) they reduce mortality. They also suppress VA in some patients with structurally normal hearts and can enhance antiarrhythmic efficacy when combined with membrane-stabilizing antiarrhythmic medications; however, early beta blocker use in MI with risk factors for shock (>70 years of age, symptoms <12 hours [ST-elevation MI patients], systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg, and heart rate >110 beat/min on presentation) is associated with an increased risk of shock or death.

Recommendations for management of cardiac arrest (initial treatment and ischemia-directed care)—Patients presenting with ventricular arrhythmia (VA) with hemodynamic instability should undergo direct current cardioversion. In patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), angiography with emergency revascularization is recommended. Patients with a wide-QRS tachycardia should be presumed to have VT if the diagnosis is unclear. In patients with hemodynamically stable VT, administration of intravenous procainamide can be useful to attempt to terminate VT. In patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT that is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy, intravenous lidocaine can be beneficial. In patients with polymorphic VT due to myocardial ischemia, intravenous beta blockers can be useful. In patients with a recent MI who have VT/VF that repeatedly recurs despite direct current cardioversion and antiarrhythmic medications (VT/VF storm), an intravenous beta blocker can be useful.

Level of Evidence

Guidelines published from 2008 to 2012 comprised 12.6% (343) LOE A recommendations, 42.4% (1151) LOE B recommendations, and 44.9% (1219) LOE C recommendations (Figure 3). Comparatively, guidelines from 2013 to 2017 consisted of 11.2% (223 compared with 2008–2012) LOE A, 53.1% (1060) LOE B recommendations, and 35.8% (715) LOE C recommendations. The overall reduction in the number of recommendations was mainly driven by the reduction in proportion of LOE C recommendations.

This is a review of the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guidelines with guidance for intraoperative physicians. Ventricular arrhythmias occurring during the perioperative period have the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Hence, an in-depth knowledge of VA mechanisms, prevention, and management is crucial for all clinicians caring for these at-risk patients in the perioperative period. Perioperative optimization of patients with a known or suspected VA should be tailored to the specific patient population and condition as outlined in this manuscript.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^e56eb45b]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide is indicated for the prevention of:

- paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), including atrioventricular nodal 	reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and other supraventricular 	tachycardias of unspecified mechanism associated with disabling symptoms

- paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms

Flecainide is also indicated for the prevention of:

-	documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (sustained VT), that in the judgment of the physician are life threatening.

Use of flecainide for the treatment of sustained VT, like other antiarrhythmics, should be initiated in the hospital. The use of flecainide is not recommended in patients with less severe ventricular arrhythmias even if the patients are symptomatic.

Because of the proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, its use should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

Flecainide should not be used in patients with recent myocardial infarction. (See Boxed WARNINGS .)

Use of flecainide in chronic atrial fibrillation has not been adequately studied and is not recommended. (See Boxed WARNINGS .)

As is the case for other antiarrhythmic agents, there is no evidence from controlled trials that the use of flecainide favorably affects survival or the incidence of sudden death.

### Treatment of persistent ventricular tachycardia: drugs or ablation? [^1c974d60]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce the mortality risk associated with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can frequently terminate VT episodes painlessly, but do not prevent recurrent episodes. For patients with symptomatic recurrences, frequent asymptomatic recurrences, ICD shocks, or VT storm, most clinicians recommend strategies to suppress VT. The proarrhythmic mortality risk of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) may be mitigated by the presence of an ICD, but these medications are limited by high recurrence rates, and unfavorable side effect profiles. Catheter ablation is an alternative or adjunctive option, but is also limited by incomplete efficacy and procedural risk.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia—definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term “hemodynamically unstable” has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

### Amiodarone hci [^bd037702]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients refractory to other therapy. Amiodarone HCl injection also can be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. During or after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, patients may be transferred to oral amiodarone therapy (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

Amiodarone HCl injection should be used for acute treatment until the patient’s ventricular arrhythmias are stabilized. Most patients will require this therapy for 48 to 96 hours, but amiodarone HCl injection may be safely administered for longer periods if necessary.

Myocardial ischemia and revascularization—Myocardial ischemia is a cause of sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), and revascularization is an effective treatment to prevent myocardial ischemia; observational studies show that patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) had substantially better survival after accounting for other predictors, the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) appears comparable for complex ischemic heart disease randomized to treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus CABG, for patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ischemic heart disease amenable to CABG the risk of SCD is lower with CABG than medical therapy, and studies show an association between a lower likelihood of death with revascularization for survivors of SCA and CABG or PCI; however, revascularization alone is usually insufficient to prevent recurrence of sustained monomorphic VT, and further evaluation for inducible VT is generally considered if ventricular function is depressed and/or scar is present.

### Nexterone (amiodarone hci) [^3629d6ac]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS & USAGE

NEXTERONE is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation (VF) and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients refractory to other therapy. NEXTERONE also can be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. During or after treatment with NEXTERONE, patients may be transferred to oral amiodarone therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Use NEXTERONE for acute treatment until the patient's ventricular arrhythmias are stabilized. Most patients will require this therapy for 48 to 96 hours, but NEXTERONE may be safely administered for longer periods if necessary.

### Current treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: state of the art [^b9497102]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias may be benign, requiring only evaluation for associated risks and then reassurance, or associated with a risk of sudden death or significant morbidity. Therapies for these arrhythmias have evolved considerably over the past 20 years. For some, a definitive, curative therapy is available in the form of catheter ablation. Others are best managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator that provides effective arrhythmia termination and protection from sudden death, with antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation to control recurrent arrhythmias. Although progress has been substantial, many challenges remain.

ACC/AHA/ESC sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia—acute management recommendations state that wide-QRS tachycardia should be presumed to be VT if the diagnosis is unclear (Level of Evidence: C). Direct current cardioversion with appropriate sedation is recommended at any point in the treatment cascade in patients with suspected sustained monomorphic VT with hemodynamic compromise (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous procainamide (or ajmaline in some European countries) is reasonable for initial treatment of patients with stable sustained monomorphic VT (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone is reasonable in patients with sustained monomorphic VT that is hemodynamically unstable, refractory to conversion with countershock, or recurrent despite procainamide or other agents (Level of Evidence: C). Transvenous catheter pace termination can be useful to treat patients with sustained monomorphic VT that is refractory to cardioversion or is frequently recurrent despite antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous lidocaine might be reasonable for the initial treatment of patients with stable sustained monomorphic VT specifically associated with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction (Level of Evidence: C). Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem should not be used in patients to terminate wide-QRS-complex tachycardia of unknown origin, especially in patients with a history of myocardial dysfunction (Level of Evidence: C).

### Trends in venous thromboembolism anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (...) [^c1223345]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study of 1351 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which 1127 patients received anticoagulation, 34. 8% missed 2 or more days of VTE prophylaxis. Use of only prophylactic-dose or treatment-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality vs no anticoagulation; however, only prophylactic-dose anticoagulation remained associated with lower mortality at 60 days. Meaning These findings suggest that prophylactic-dose VTE anticoagulation may be optimal therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Importance Venous thromboembolism is a common complication of COVID-19. It is not well understood how hospitals have managed VTE prevention and the effect of prevention strategies on mortality. First, there has been a concerted emphasis on VTE prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 2-5 Second, many experts have advocated for escalating doses of prophylactic anticoagulation for some patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

4, 6, 7 The potential importance of these practices has been highlighted further by a 2020 retrospective study8 showing a potential mortality benefit with treatment- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. Of 1351 total patients, 1127 received pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis at some point during their hospital stay and were evaluated for nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis. Subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin injections were the most common prophylactic regimens. Of those who ever received treatment- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, approximately one-third missed 2 or more days of VTE prophylaxis. In this large, multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, use of treatment-dose anticoagulation was common, varied widely between hospitals, and increased over time.

In addition to confirming recent findings suggesting both prophylactic- and treatment-dose anticoagulation strategies are associated with lower in-hospital mortality, we found that only prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower 60-day mortality. For patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we found both prophylactic- and treatment-dose anticoagulation were associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared with no anticoagulation. Given that only prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with lower 60-day mortality, prophylactic-dose VTE prophylaxis may be the optimal therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline—amiodarone, lidocaine, and procainamide for VT: In 1 study, amiodarone was more effective than lidocaine in terminating incessant VT with improved survival at 24 hours. For patients with recurrent, stable VT not in the setting of an AMI, intravenous procainamide has been shown to be superior to lidocaine for terminating the arrhythmia, and one randomized trial of 62 patients found procainamide superior to amiodarone for termination of stable VT. Adverse events, including hypotension were more common with amiodarone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Procainamide and its metabolite n-acetylprocainamide have potassium channel blocking properties that may prolong the QT interval, and in patients who already have QT prolongation, administration of procainamide may further prolong the QT interval and lead to torsades de pointes.

### Preventive or deferred ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and implantable defibrillator (BERLIN VT): a multicenter randomized trial [^113f49e6]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) reduces the recurrence of VT in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The appropriate timing of VT ablation and its effects on mortality and heart failure progression remain a matter of debate. In patients with life-threatening arrhythmias necessitating ICD implantation, we compared outcomes of preventive VT ablation (undertaken before ICD implantation to prevent ICD shocks for VT) and deferred ablation after 3 ICD shocks for VT.

Methods

The BERLIN VT study (Preventive Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia in Patients With Myocardial Infarction) was a prospective, open, parallel, randomized trial performed at 26 centers. Patients with stable ischemic cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction between 30% and 50%, and documented VT were randomly assigned 1:1 to a preventive or deferred ablation strategy. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and unplanned hospitalization for either symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia or worsening heart failure. Secondary outcomes included sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and appropriate ICD therapy. We hypothesized that preventive ablation strategy would be superior to deferred ablation strategy in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 396±284 days, the primary end point occurred in 25 (32.9%) of 76 patients in the preventive ablation group and 23 (27.7%) of 83 patients in the deferred ablation group (hazard ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.62-1.92]; P =0.77). On the basis of prespecified criteria for interim analyses, the study was terminated early for futility. In the preventive versus deferred ablation group, 6 versus 2 patients died (7.9% versus 2.4%; P =0.18), 8 versus 2 patients were admitted for worsening heart failure (10.4% versus 2.3%; P =0.062), and 15 versus 21 patients were hospitalized for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (19.5% versus 25.3%; P =0.27). Among secondary outcomes, the proportions of patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (39.7% versus 48.2%; P =0.050) and appropriate ICD therapy (34.2% versus 47.0%; P =0.020) were numerically reduced in the preventive ablation group.

Conclusions

Preventive VT ablation before ICD implantation did not reduce mortality or hospitalization for arrhythmia or worsening heart failure during 1 year of follow-up compared with the deferred ablation strategy. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02501005.

Ischemic heart disease—recurrent ventricular arrhythmia (VA) treatment recommendations: In patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent VA with significant symptoms or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks despite optimal device programming and ongoing beta-blocker therapy, amiodarone or sotalol is useful to suppress recurrent VA. In patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) and recurrent symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or who present with VT storm and have failed or are intolerant of amiodarone or other antiarrhythmic medications, catheter ablation is recommended. In patients with ischemic heart disease and ICD shocks for sustained monomorphic VT or symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT that is recurrent, or hemodynamically tolerated, catheter ablation as first-line therapy may be considered to reduce recurrent VA. In patients with prior MI, class IC antiarrhythmic medications (eg, flecainide and propafenone) should not be used. In incessant VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF), an ICD should not be implanted until sufficient control of the VA is achieved to prevent repeated ICD shocks. In ischemic heart disease and sustained monomorphic VT, coronary revascularization alone is an ineffective therapy to prevent recurrent VT.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^ba188274]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, primary prevention of SCD, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing ICD placement in nonhospitalized patients with NYHA class IV symptoms eligible for cardiac transplantation or a LV assist device, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year.

Beta blockers—ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD): Because of their excellent safety profile and effectiveness in treating VA and reducing the risk of SCD, beta blockers are often first-line antiarrhythmic therapy, and they reduce all-cause mortality and SCD in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Early beta blocker use in myocardial infarction (MI) patients with risk factors for shock (>70 years of age, signs of HF, systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg, and heart rate >110 beat/min on presentation) is associated with an increased risk of shock or death. Beta blockers reduce mortality in polymorphic VT after MI, suppress VA in some patients with structurally normal hearts, can enhance antiarrhythmic efficacy when combined with membrane-stabilizing antiarrhythmic medications, and are also first-line therapy for some cardiac channelopathies (eg, long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia).

Reversible causes, tolerated VT, and ablation—use considerations: “In survivors of life-threatening VA that may be due to transient or reversible factors, such as AMI, proarrhythmic medication effects, or electrolyte disturbances, an ICD is not implanted if the cause may be correctable.” “This is a population of patients that still requires thorough evaluation, treatment, and close follow-up and, as in the AVID registry, mortality was still high in the population that may have had a reversible cause for their arrest.” “Small increases in troponin present a challenge in selecting patients for an ICD, as it often cannot be determined whether troponin elevation is due to ischemia from VT/VF and resuscitation, in which case an ICD is likely warranted, or an indication that ischemia caused the arrhythmia, in which case prevention of ischemia would be the therapeutic focus.” “ICDs may improve the outcomes of patients with hemodynamically tolerated sustained VT and structural heart disease; however, this has not proved in any RCT.” “VT ablation has been used as an alternative in selected patients with well-tolerated VT and appears to reduce recurrences, but the impact on long-term mortality is unknown; there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend this approach as an alternative to ICD implantation.”

### Impact of a perioperative prophylaxis guideline on post-cardiothoracic surgery atrial fibrillation [^d9e6f7c2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

National practice guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on combination pharmacological regimens to reduce cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF).

Objective

This study examines if there is a reduction in POAF rates after implementing a perioperative prophylaxis guideline that includes amiodarone, β-blockers, and high-intensity statins.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected on 400 adults (200 patients pre-guideline implementation and 200 patients post-guideline implementation) with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes Mellitus, and Vascular Disease) score of at least 3 points after CTS. Data were collected on the incidence of POAF lasting more than 5 minutes and secondary outcomes, including the length of hospitalization, guideline adherence rate, adverse events, and timeliness of POAF treatment.

Results

Guideline implementation increased prophylactic amiodarone ( P < 0.0001), statin ( P = 0.029), and high-intensity statin ( P = 0.002) use without changing β-blocker use (64.5% vs 67.0%, P = 0.673) and reduced POAF (39.5% vs 52.0%, P = 0.016) and ventricular tachycardia (15.5% vs 24.5%, P = 0.034) compared with preguideline rates. Length of hospitalization and other postoperative adverse events, including stroke and mortality, were not statistically different. Subgroup analyses of patients who were adherent to both the amiodarone and β-blocker recommendations (28% of the total) or to all 3 recommended therapies (24% of the total) had significant decreases in POAF ( P = 0.001; P < 0.001), length of hospitalization ( P = 0.023; P = 0.049), length of intensive care unit stay ( P = 0.045; P = 0.040), and ventricular tachycardia ( P = 0.008; P = 0.017) compared with preguideline patients, respectively.

Conclusions

A perioperative guideline of amiodarone, β-blockers, and high-intensity statins reduced POAF, but better benefits may result from enhanced adherence.

Ventricular tachycardia storm and incessant VT—clinical features and initial management note that while a definition of greater than 2 episodes in 24 h has been used, much more frequent episodes can also occur, and hemodynamically stable VT lasting hours has been termed “incessant.” Severe underlying heart disease is frequently present, although VT storm can occur in patients who have a structurally normal heart. Polymorphic VT storm in a patient with coronary disease is strongly suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia; pauses may occur prior to polymorphic VT even in the absence of QT prolongation. Frequent appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks may represent part of the natural history of advanced heart disease and may or may not portend a serious deterioration in underlying prognosis. Management highlights include that the first step in VT storm is to identify and correct inciting factors and that with frequent ICD shocks electrograms and programming should be reviewed to determine if device reprogramming is desirable; intravenous beta blockade should be considered for a polymorphic VT storm as it is the single most effective therapy and revascularization procedures may be urgently needed, with additional examples that in Brugada syndrome quinidine or isoproterenol may terminate incessant arrhythmias, in acute ischemia intravenous amiodarone seems more effective than other antiarrhythmic drugs, and pacing may be useful especially if the tachycardia onset is pause dependent.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline—beta blockers for recurrent VF/VT after MI: In a large meta-analysis of antiarrhythmic medications in the setting of AMI, beta blockers were associated with a significant reduction in mortality, and beta blockers can be effective in suppressing recurrent VF in patients with recent MI with an associated improvement in survival. In patients with recurrent VT/VF (VT/VF storm) in the setting of a recent MI that is refractory to amiodarone and/or lidocaine and repeated cardioversion, administration of a beta blocker has been shown to improve survival at 1 week, and survival at 1 year was also better in those treated with a beta blocker; for those who did not survive, mortality was mostly due to recurrent VF. Other measures to reduce sympathetic tone including sedation and general anesthesia are also often used.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline—management of cardiac arrest (beneficial/considered therapies): Patients presenting with ventricular arrhythmia (VA) with hemodynamic instability should undergo direct cardioversion (Class I, Level A). In patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) with ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (MI), angiography with emergency revascularization is recommended (Class I, Level B‑NR). Patients with a wide‑QRS tachycardia should be presumed to have VT if the diagnosis is unclear (Class I, Level C‑EO). In hemodynamically stable VT, intravenous procainamide can be useful to attempt to terminate VT (Class IIa, Level A). For witnessed cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT unresponsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy, intravenous lidocaine can be beneficial (Class IIa, Level B‑R). In polymorphic VT due to myocardial ischemia, intravenous beta blockers can be useful (Class IIa, Level B‑R). In recent MI with VT/VF storm that recurs despite direct current cardioversion and antiarrhythmic medications, an intravenous beta blocker can be useful (Class IIa, Level B‑NR). In cardiac arrest, epinephrine 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes during CPR may be reasonable (Class IIb, Level A). In hemodynamically stable VT, administration of intravenous amiodarone or sotalol may be considered to attempt to terminate VT (Class IIb, Level B‑R).

Chronic CHD—sustained VT procedural strategies: Curative therapy using surgical resection or catheter ablation should be considered for patients with frequent recurrences of VT unresponsive to antiarrhythmic drugs, and hemodynamically stable tachycardia may be considered for curative catheter ablation; some have only 1 or 2 tachycardia circuits and may be cured. Following correction of ischemia, patients with sustained VT causing severe hemodynamic compromise may benefit from electrophysiology (EP) testing, and the ICD is the primary therapy for such patients.

Treatment and prevention of recurrent ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in patients with ischemic heart disease—recommendations with class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) are as follows. Class I (LOE B-R): In patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) with significant symptoms or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks despite optimal device programming and optimal medical therapy with a beta blocker, amiodarone or sotalol is useful to suppress recurrent VA. Class I: In patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) and recurrent episodes of symptomatic sustained VT, or who present with VT storm and have failed or are intolerant of amiodarone, catheter ablation is recommended. Class IIb (LOE C-LD): In patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent ICD shocks for sustained monomorphic VT or symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT that is recurrent, or hemodynamically tolerated, catheter ablation as first-line therapy may be considered to reduce recurrent VT. Class III: Harm (LOE B-R): In patients with prior MI, class Ic antiarrhythmic medications (eg, flecainide and propafenone) should not be used.

Ischemic heart disease—secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recommendations include: In patients with ischemic heart disease who either survive sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), or experience hemodynamically unstable VT (LOE: B-R) or stable sustained VT (LOE: B-NR) not due to reversible causes, an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected. A transvenous ICD provides intermediate value in the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) particularly when the patient’s risk of death due to a ventricular arrhythmia (VA) is deemed high and the risk of nonarrhythmic death (either cardiac or noncardiac) is deemed low based on the patient’s burden of comorbidities and functional status; this corresponds to “Value Statement: Intermediate Value (LOE: B-R).” In patients with ischemic heart disease and unexplained syncope who have inducible sustained monomorphic VT on electrophysiological study, an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected.

Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator recipients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and frequent appropriate ICD firing—management: This extreme has been called defibrillator (tachycardia) storm and requires the addition of antiarrhythmic drugs and/or catheter ablation to control recurrent VT and associated ICD shocks; sotalol is effective in suppressing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and combining beta blockers with amiodarone is an alternative. Because many such patients have low EF and poor renal function, amiodarone and beta blockers rather than sotalol can be the first-line therapy; sotalol should be avoided in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function or significant heart failure, and intravenous amiodarone has been useful.

### Acute treatment of patients with supraventricular (...) [^22d4d67f]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are recommended for the termination of regular SVT of uncertain type, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for the termination of any hemodynamically unstable SVT. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, SVT should be treated with synchronized cardioversion when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol is recommended for control of heat rate in patients with hemodynamically stable atrial flutter and for the treatment of hemodynamically stable focal atrial tachycardia.

Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol can be useful in terminating hemodynamically stable regular SVT of uncertain type, multifocal atrial tachycardia. Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to mirror recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation. Treatment of pre-excited atrial fibrillation with intravenous digoxin, intravenous amiodarone, intravenous or oral β-blockers, diltiazem, and verapamil is potentially harmful. Instead, intravenous ibutilide or procainamide is recommended for the treatment of hemodynamically stable pre-excited atrial fibrillation.

For the termination of SVT, the guideline addressed the following interventions: vagal maneuvers, adenosine, synchronized cardioversion, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic medications, and rapid atrial pacing. The potential benefits and harms of each intervention were carefully considered. Interventions used for the termination of SVT are generally safe as long as no contraindications exist. For example, β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers should not be given in the presence of hypotension. The 1 recommendation involving harm was related to giving digoxin, amiodarone, β-blockers, or calcium-channel blockers for pre-excited atrial fibrillation.

Prior myocardial infarction with recurrent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)—The randomized VANISH trial compared escalating antiarrhythmic medication therapy versus catheter ablation in patients with prior myocardial infarction and recurrent sustained monomorphic VT despite antiarrhythmic medications. The primary outcome, a composite of death, VT storm, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks occurred in 59.1% in the ablation group and in 68.5% in the escalated-therapy group, with no difference in mortality, and recurrent ICD shocks and VT storm and treatment-related adverse events were lower in the ablation group. In subgroup analysis, patients having VT on amiodarone had better outcomes with ablation compared with increasing amiodarone or adding mexiletine to amiodarone, whereas for patients receiving medications other than amiodarone catheter ablation did not reduce the risk of ICD shocks or VT storm compared with switching to amiodarone. Procedural complications occur in approximately 6% of patients and procedure mortality is <1% in experienced centers.

Algorithm—polymorphic VT/VF with ICD and recurrent arrhythmia: Management should start with ensuring that the ICD is programmed appropriately and that potential precipitating causes, including heart failure exacerbation, are addressed. For polymorphic VT/VF, consider reversible causes and treat for QT prolongation, discontinue offending medication, correct electrolytes (Class I), and revascularize (Class I) when indicated; if no reversible causes, options include Amiodarone (Class I) or Beta blockers or lidocaine (Class IIa). If arrhythmia is not controlled, the presence of identifiable PVC triggers leads to Catheter ablation (Class I), whereas absent triggers lead to Autonomic modulation (Class IIb).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia—clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some “idiopathic” VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a “first line” is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

Unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia—if recurrent VT is monomorphic and the EF is normal, either procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone or lidocaine can be used; if the EF is low, amiodarone or lidocaine is recommended (amiodarone 150 mg intravenously over 10 min or lidocaine 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenous push). For polymorphic VT with normal baseline QT, correct ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities and then consider administration of a beta blocker or lidocaine or amiodarone or procainamide or sotalol; if the EF is low, treatment with amiodarone 150 mg intravenously over 10 min or lidocaine 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenous push is recommended, and if the baseline QT is prolonged, other treatments may include magnesium, overdrive pacing, isoproterenol, phenytoin, or lidocaine.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks from ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease: preventative measures, shortcomings, cost-effectiveness, and global practice perspectives [^1107db62]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have proven to be life-saving devices in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) who are prone to develop ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are commonly prescribed in many such patients with ICDs to treat and prevent different forms of arrhythmias in clinical practice. When these patients experience recurrent monomorphic VT despite chronic AADs therapy, or when AAD therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, and VT storm is refractory to AAD therapy, catheter ablation constitute guideline-based class I indication of treatment. However, what should be the most appropriate strategy to prevent first ICD shock or subsequent multiple shocks from VT/VF in patients with ICM who undergo ICD implantation without prior incidence of cardiac arrest, remains debatable. The purpose of this review is to discuss preventative aspects of ICD shocks for VT and the shortcomings of these measures along with the cost-effectiveness and global perspectives based on the current knowledge of the topic.
