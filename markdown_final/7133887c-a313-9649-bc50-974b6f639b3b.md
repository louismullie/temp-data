## Question

Ecstasy and Parkinson

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ecstasy (MDMA) is linked to Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism, and how strong that evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of MDMA and its known neurotoxicity profile. Then, I should verify whether there is direct human evidence linking MDMA to Parkinson's disease. Next, I will examine animal and mechanistic data that might bridge the gap. After that, I need to consider confounders like polydrug use and dose. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications for clinicians and patients.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and neurotoxicity profile of MDMA. MDMA acutely releases serotonin and dopamine and, at higher or repeated doses, can damage serotonergic axon terminals in animals, with some reports of persistent deficits lasting months to years; in humans, imaging and neuropsychological studies show dose-dependent reductions in serotonin transporter binding and subtle executive dysfunction, though reversibility and causality remain debated [^92f172a0] [^0302bdef] [^27783f8c] [^f96b223b].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is direct human evidence linking MDMA to Parkinson's disease. I initially thought there were multiple case reports, but hold on, I should double-check the strength of that signal. The most frequently cited human data are limited to a single case report of a heavy ecstasy user who developed rapidly progressive parkinsonism; however, causality cannot be inferred from a single case, and the authors explicitly note the neurological problems may be unrelated to drug use, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^3b1c978c].

> Next, I should review animal and mechanistic data that might plausibly connect MDMA to parkinsonism. In nonhuman primates, sequential MPTP (a dopaminergic neurotoxin) followed by MDMA produced a double lesion model with serotonergic terminal injury and altered rigidity and dyskinesia phenotypes, suggesting serotonergic loss can modulate motor expression even when dopaminergic injury is present; this supports biological plausibility but does not prove human causation [^178a5e95]. Let me also consider broader psychostimulant literature: methamphetamine exposure is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease and earlier onset in several paradigms, indicating that stimulant neurotoxicity can intersect with PD pathobiology, though MDMA is not identical to methamphetamine and extrapolation must be cautious [^11df9c70] [^f594e5cf].

> I need to ensure I account for confounders that could inflate risk estimates. Heavy ecstasy users often co-use other substances that are themselves neurotoxic to dopamine or serotonin systems, and many human studies recruit unusually heavy users, which may overestimate effects seen in typical users; this polydrug confounding and selection bias complicate inference about MDMA-specific risk for parkinsonism [^803d383f] [^7c78cf8b]. Hold on, I should verify dose considerations: neuroimaging changes in serotonin markers are more consistent in heavy users (> 50 lifetime tablets), whereas moderate users often do not show clear deficits, reinforcing a dose-dependent but still uncertain causal link to clinically meaningful parkinsonism [^4bf6f69b].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence. Direct human evidence linking MDMA to Parkinson's disease is very limited, essentially a single case report, so the human data quality is very low and cannot establish causality. Animal and mechanistic data show that MDMA can injure serotonergic systems and, in the context of dopaminergic injury, alter motor phenotype, which provides biological plausibility but remains indirect. Epidemiologic data specifically for MDMA and PD are lacking, so we cannot estimate attributable risk or prevalence differences in exposed populations [^3b1c978c] [^178a5e95] [^0302bdef].

> But wait, what if MDMA's serotonergic toxicity meaningfully alters basal ganglia function even without classic PD pathology? The basal ganglia circuitry integrates dopaminergic and serotonergic inputs, and serotonergic loss can modulate motor symptoms and dyskinesias in PD models; however, translating this into a clinically defined PD risk in humans requires longitudinal, dose-quantified cohorts that we do not yet have, so I should be careful not to overstate clinical risk from mechanistic observations alone [^178a5e95] [^cd574fe7].

> I should confirm practical clinical implications. Given the absence of robust epidemiologic or longitudinal human data, routine screening for PD solely due to past MDMA use is not warranted; however, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parkinsonian signs in patients with heavy psychostimulant exposure histories and consider early referral if symptoms emerge, while also counseling that current evidence does not show a clear, large increase in PD risk from typical MDMA use patterns [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader psychostimulant guidance: expert reviews advise vigilance for neuropsychiatric sequelae, including PD, in psychostimulant users, which supports individualized risk assessment rather than population-wide screening [^f594e5cf].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise. There is no established causal relationship between ecstasy use and Parkinson's disease in humans, but there is credible biological plausibility that heavy or repeated MDMA exposure could contribute to neurochemical vulnerabilities that interact with dopaminergic systems; clinicians should document exposure history, counsel on dose-related neurotoxic risks, and monitor for emerging motor or nonmotor parkinsonian features, while recognizing that current evidence remains limited and indirect [^3b1c978c] [^178a5e95] [^0302bdef].

Ecstasy (MDMA) is **not directly linked to Parkinson's disease** in humans, but heavy or repeated use can cause serotonergic neurotoxicity [^0302bdef] and may worsen motor symptoms in vulnerable individuals [^notfound]. Animal data show MDMA can damage serotonin terminals [^178a5e95] and, when combined with dopaminergic injury, alter motor rigidity and dyskinesias, but **human evidence for PD causation is weak** [^notfound]. Case reports describe parkinsonism in heavy users [^3b1c978c], yet confounding by other drugs and pre-existing traits is common [^803d383f]. Clinicians should screen for MDMA use in patients with early-onset or atypical parkinsonism and counsel on risks, but routine screening is not indicated.

## Pharmacological effects of MDMA relevant to Parkinson's disease

MDMA increases serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine release [^92f172a0]; chronic use can cause **serotonergic neurotoxicity** [^0302bdef], with persistent reductions in serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin metabolites [^4bf6f69b]. Serotonin modulates motor control via basal ganglia circuits [^cd574fe7], so injury may theoretically worsen motor symptoms in PD or predispose vulnerable individuals to parkinsonism [^178a5e95].

---

## Evidence from animal studies

Animal studies show MDMA causes **serotonergic axonal damage** [^92f172a0] and can interact with dopaminergic injury to alter motor phenotype:

- **Serotonergic neurotoxicity**: MDMA damages serotonin terminals in rats and primates, with effects lasting months to years [^92f172a0].
- **Interaction with dopaminergic injury**: In MPTP-treated monkeys, MDMA worsened rigidity and altered dyskinesias without affecting tremor or bradykinesia, suggesting serotonergic loss modulates motor expression [^178a5e95].
- **Dose dependence**: Neurotoxicity is dose- and temperature-dependent, with higher doses and hyperthermia increasing severity [^92f172a0].

---

## Evidence from human studies

Human data are limited and inconsistent; **no robust evidence** shows MDMA causes PD, but observational and case studies suggest possible associations:

- **Case reports**: Rapidly progressive parkinsonism has been reported in heavy ecstasy users [^3b1c978c], but causality is uncertain due to confounding.
- **Neuroimaging**: Heavy MDMA users show reduced SERT binding and serotonin markers [^27783f8c], with partial recovery after abstinence [^0302bdef].
- **Cognitive effects**: Executive dysfunction is reported in heavy users, but polydrug use and pre-existing traits complicate interpretation [^f96b223b] [^803d383f].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Clinicians should consider MDMA exposure in patients with early-onset or atypical parkinsonism, especially with a history of heavy use. Routine screening is not indicated, but **targeted counseling** on potential neurotoxic risks is reasonable. Management follows standard PD protocols, with attention to medication interactions and patient education.

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings** | **Strength of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Animal studies | Serotonergic neurotoxicity; interaction with dopaminergic injury altering motor symptoms | Strong |
| Human studies | - Case reports of parkinsonism <br/> - Reduced SERT binding <br/> - Cognitive deficits | Weak to moderate |
| Clinical guidelines | No specific recommendations; general caution advised | Low |

---

MDMA is **not proven to cause Parkinson's disease**, but heavy use can injure serotonin systems and may worsen motor symptoms in susceptible individuals. Animal data support biological plausibility, but human evidence remains limited and confounded; clinicians should individualize assessment and counseling.

### Rapidly progressive parkinsonism in a self-reported user of ecstasy and other drugs [^3b1c978c]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old man developed parkinsonism that progressed to Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 within 4 years of onset. Response to ropinirole deteriorated, levodopa was not tolerated, and subthalamic nucleus stimulation has provided only partial relief of symptoms. He reported heavy use of Ecstasy through most of his twenties and thirties. His neurological problems may be unrelated to his drug use, but it is also possible they represent an idiosyncratic reaction.

### Homeostatic changes of the endocannabinoid system in Parkinson's disease [^cd574fe7]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipids that bind principally type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid (CB(1) and CB(2)) receptors. N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are the best characterized eCBs that are released from membrane phospholipid precursors through multiple biosynthetic pathways. Together with their receptors and metabolic enzymes, eCBs form the so-called "eCB system". The later has been involved in a wide variety of actions, including modulation of basal ganglia function. Consistently, both eCB levels and CB(1) receptor expression are high in several basal ganglia regions, and more specifically in the striatum and in its target projection areas. In these regions, the eCB system establishes a close functional interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission, supporting a relevant role for eCBs in the control of voluntary movements. Accordingly, compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that a profound rearrangement of the eCB system in the basal ganglia follows dopamine depletion, as it occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this article, we provide a brief survey of the evidence that the eCB system changes in both animal models of, and patients suffering from, PD. A striking convergence of findings is observed between both rodent and primate models and PD patients, indicating that the eCB system undergoes dynamic, adaptive changes, aimed at restoring an apparent homeostasis within the basal ganglia network.

### Behavioural impact of a double dopaminergic and serotonergic lesion in the non-human primate [^178a5e95]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease. To determine the role of this 5-HT injury-besides the dopaminergic one in the parkinsonian symptomatology-we developed a new monkey model exhibiting a double dopaminergic/serotonergic lesion by sequentially using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA, better known as ecstasy). By positron emission tomography imaging and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that MDMA injured 5-HT nerve terminals in the brain of MPTP monkeys. Unexpectedly, this injury had no impact on tremor or on bradykinesia, but altered rigidity. It abolished the l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and neuropsychiatric-like behaviours, without altering the anti-parkinsonian response. These data demonstrate that 5-HT fibres play a critical role in the expression of both motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, and highlight that an imbalance between the 5-HT and dopaminergic innervating systems is involved in specific basal ganglia territories for different symptoms.

### Rare but relevant: methamphetamine and Parkinson's disease [^11df9c70]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence from a number of paradigms suggests that methamphetamine use is associated with increased risk for the development of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, and that it may be associated with the premature development of Parkinson's disease. Prevalence of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism is greater in both methamphetamine users and people who previously used methamphetamine, and evidence from animal studies provides a plausible mechanism for this observation. Despite this increased risk, Parkinson's disease is rarely diagnosed in methamphetamine users. Reasons for this may include under-detection, premature mortality, and individual and substance use characteristics which moderate the risk, including higher rates of smoking. Clinicians should be vigilant to signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism in methamphetamine users.

### Role of serotonin in modulation of decision-making in Parkinson's disease [^34e3bf44]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

It has previously been argued that SSRIs might actually exacerbate apathy symptoms in PD patients. 28 As apathy levels were low overall in the current study, our mildly unmotivated patients may have experienced a further citalopram-induced reduction of motivation to a level that we could detect in task performance. However, the interaction between apathy and citalopram was linked to changes in intrinsic motivation and effort sensitivity, not changes to reward sensitivity. This might point to a slightly different process through which serotonin is involved in reward and effort-based decision-making. More work is required to develop a full picture of this pattern, for example by modulating serotonin in the opposing direction, such as with acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). One previous study reported a small but significant increase in depression scores with ATD, but this occurred in both the PD and healthy control group.

The interpretation of these findings is complicated by the fact that most of the patients tested in the current study were taking dopaminergic medication, and of these, all were tested while on their usual regimen. It is possible this influenced outcomes; this will need to be further investigated in future cross-over studies. In, an effect of dopaminergic medication was primarily observed for acceptance of high effort, high reward offers. Crucially, the authors did not find an interaction between apathy and dopamine, such that the effect of dopamine on offer acceptance rate did not depend on levels of motivation. This may suggest that while dopamine influences goal-directed behaviour especially in terms of reward valuation, serotonin may be more involved with a baseline 'readiness' to act or overcome effort.

Intriguingly, the correlation between the change in motivated behaviour on citalopram and baseline motivation was strongest for the social subscale of the AMI, which measures levels of social engagement. A role for serotonin in social motivation is in accord with reports of increased prosocial behaviour after increasing serotonergic levels in the brain, for example by administration of citalopram or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy). Establishing whether social, emotional and behavioural forms of apathy may be differentially influenced by neurotransmitter function may help decode the vast individual differences in response to drug treatment for apathy.

### Psychostimulant use and the brain [^f594e5cf]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Psychostimulant users are typically young adults. We have conducted a narrative review of neuropsychiatric harms associated with the psychostimulants methamphetamine/amphetamine, cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), focusing on epidemiological factors, common clinical presentations, underlying causal mechanisms and treatment options. The major neuropsychiatric harms of psychostimulant use are stroke, neurocognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, seizures and psychotic illness. These arise through a combination of acute monoamine release, longer-term neurotransmitter effects and indirect effects. These effects are moderated by factors in the individual and in the pattern of substance use. Neuropsychiatric harms associated with psychostimulant use can thus lead to severe long-term impairment.

### Pesticides and parkinsonism: is there an etiological link? [^b338b8f1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Two hundred years ago, Parkinson's disease was rare. Now, it is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. A recent twin study showed clearly that genetic factors play a minor role in determining whether an individual develops this disease, rekindling an interest in the etiological significance of environmental factors. Earlier studies had shown that a MPTP, a contaminant found in some illegal drugs, caused Parkinson's disease. This provided the original impetus for the pesticide hypothesis. Similarities between MPTP and pesticides coupled with epidemiological and animal studies have strengthened the possible link between pesticide exposure and the subsequent development of Parkinson's disease.

### Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease are reduced by nabilone [^56d400cd]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this pilot trial, we also found a worsening of motor symptoms (MDS‐UPDRS‐III and the total motor score [parts II and III]) in the placebo group. Amelioration of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity in patients with PD has been described after smoking cannabis in a few small‐sized studies. 10 Trials in PD mainly focused on the effect of cannabinoids on levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) given their interaction with the glutamatergic system. 28, 29 As disturbing motor complications were an exclusion criterion in this study, we are not able to report about effects of nabilone on LID.

The ECS plays a significant part in motor control and the regulation of various non‐motor functions, including mood, attention and concentration, eating habits, sleep, and pain. 7, 14 In animal models, a high amount of cannabinoid 1 receptors is found in presynaptic nerve terminals of gamma‐Aminobutyric acid‐ergic synapses and in cortical and limbic serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurons, as well as neurons with μ‐opioid receptors. Moreover, structures of the ECS co‐localize with nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord. Consequently, cannabinoids are believed to modulate monoaminergic, gamma‐Aminobutyric acid‐ergic, glutamatergic, and opioid signaling. 30, 31, 32 Data from animal and human positron emission tomography (PET) studies reveal a high density of cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia where the ECS is believed to function as a regulator of dopamine release and uptake. 33, 34, 35, 36 Following the loss of dopamine, the ECS is overactive in the striatum of patients with PD with upregulation of its neurotransmitter and receptor levels possibly reflecting a compensational mechanism. 7, 34, 37 With respect to these findings, a positive effect of nabilone on NMS in patients with PD is not surprising. The few studies assessing the ECS and sleep showed that exogenous cannabinoids promote sleep, increase REM sleep, and the stability of non‐REM sleep. 38 In patients with PD, an influence of cholinergic neurons in brain areas involved in the regulation of sleep and sleep–wake cycle has been proposed as a possible underlying mechanism. 9 Besides symptomatic treatment, preclinical research revealing neuroprotective properties of cannabinoids gains interest in clinicians dealing with patients with movement disorders. 39, 40, 41

### Parkinsonism following neuroleptic exposure: a double-hit hypothesis? [^abd4b6f4]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Drug-induced parkinsonism is caused by an offending drug and should resolve after the causative agent has been withdrawn. However, in a number of patients, symptoms persist or may even worsen over time, suggesting the development of concomitant Parkinson's disease. The prevalence estimates of Parkinson's disease after neuroleptic exposure are unexpectedly high, suggesting a causal relationship. We critically review available literature in this regard, and some pathophysiological hypotheses that might explain such a relationship are suggested. Some patients may have an undetermined genetic susceptibility to parkinsonism. We speculate that the possible neurotoxic effect of neuroleptics exerted on a susceptible dopaminergic system would lead over the long-term to a self-fostering, progressive process. Knowledge gaps and future perspectives are discussed.

### Narrative medicine pinpoints loss of autonomy and stigma in Parkinson's disease [^802b0f30]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

These time-altering events experienced by Albert, manifest themselves in the way language is processed. This way Albert's 'Parkinson's prism' illustrates how language and being cannot be understood apart from one another:

"He began a sentence: "I am - but when he was taken by surprise, every sentence became an adventure in the woods… but in the instant of realizing he was lost, time became marvelously slow and he discovered hitherto eternities in the space between one word and the next, or rather he became trapped in that space between words and could only stand and watch as time sped on without him… " (p. 11)

In fact, the ongoing characteristics associated with Parkinson's disease, seem to amplify 'Parkinson's prism' effect on the self as narrator. Particularly because the trembling of both hands make Alfred feel betrayed:

"These shaking hands belonged to nobody but him, and yet they refused to obey him. They were like bad children. Unreasoning two-year-olds in a tantrum of selfish misery. (.) (p. 67).

Similarly, as our patient was arguing, Alfred also thought of a way to hide the physical expression of disease symptoms because 'Parkinson's prism' altered Alfred's ability to make 'sense of a distorted and parous reality':

"Alfred took pleasure in thinking about chopping his hand off with a hatchet. He wanted to let the offending limb know just how angry he was. If only to show how little he cared for it when it insisted on disobeying him. It brought a kind of ecstasy to imagine the first deep bite of the hatchet's blade into bone and muscle. But alongside his ecstasy there was also the unshakable feeling of despair. He and his hand had been together for his entire life after all. (p. 67)"

### Clearing the smoke: what protects smokers from Parkinson's disease? [^7f35a3a6]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although smoking is overall exceedingly unhealthful, its remarkably robust association with reduced PD risk remains a major yet underexplored clue to protection against the disease. In addition to the potential value for PD prevention, the basis for smoking's effects on PD risk may have therapeutic potential in manifest PD. With nicotine now effectively struck from the list of potential neuroprotective treatments for manifest PD given the decisively null results of the NIC-PD trial, renewed efforts to identify and evaluate the disease-modifying potential of other constituents of smoke and associated molecular mechanisms are warranted. Only a small number of smoking-associated explanatory candidates have been identified to date. Several features of CO at the low doses self-administered by smokers support its therapeutic potential, including (1) engagement of several PD-linked molecular cascades, (2) evidence of neuroprotection in model systems relevant to PD, and (3) safety in 23 clinical trials to date at the target dose range (see, for example, –). Research focused on CO and other smoking-associated molecules and mechanisms may light up clinical development to evaluate the safety and efficacy of leading candidates. Pursuing the potential protective effects of smoking on PD has the potential to ignite a new generation of PD prevention strategies and therapeutics.

### Dopamine-endocannabinoid interactions mediate spike-timing-dependent potentiation in the striatum [^1928ea5d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Dopamine modulates striatal synaptic plasticity, a key substrate for action selection and procedural learning. Thus, characterizing the repertoire of activity-dependent plasticity in striatum and its dependence on dopamine is of crucial importance. We recently unraveled a striatal spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) mediated by endocannabinoids (eCBs) and induced with few spikes (~5–15). Whether this eCB-tLTP interacts with the dopaminergic system remains to be investigated. Here, we report that eCB-tLTP is impaired in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease and rescued by L-DOPA. Dopamine controls eCB-tLTP via dopamine type-2 receptors (D₂R) located presynaptically in cortical terminals. Dopamine-endocannabinoid interactions via D₂R are required for the emergence of tLTP in response to few coincident pre- and post-synaptic spikes and control eCB-plasticity by modulating the long-term potentiation (LTP)/depression (LTD) thresholds. While usually considered as a depressing synaptic function, our results show that eCBs in the presence of dopamine constitute a versatile system underlying bidirectional plasticity implicated in basal ganglia pathophysiology.

### The effects of cannabis on hallucinations in Parkinson's disease patients [^d5a29720]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use is on the rise both as medical treatment and recreational use. There is evidence that cannabis can cause hallucinations and psychosis especially with heavy and prolonged use. Parkinson's disease (PD) carries an increased risk for development of hallucinations and psychosis. It is possible that cannabis may exacerbate this risk and result in earlier and greater amounts of hallucinations and psychosis in this vulnerable population. A literature review was performed to determine the answer to that question. Two articles were found which listed the incidence of hallucinations and delusions during the use of cannabis in PD patients. 21.3% or 10 out of 47 patients reported development of hallucinations while treated with cannabis and 2.8% developed delusions. While these numbers are within the range of prevalence of hallucinations and psychosis in PD, the number of studies and patients evaluated are too small to make any definite conclusions pointing to the need for more research in this area.

### Ecstasy: are animal data consistent between species and can they translate to humans? [^92f172a0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The number of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy or MDMA) animal research articles is rapidly increasing and yet studies which place emphasis on the clinical significance are limited due to a lack of reliable human data. MDMA produces an acute, rapid release of brain serotonin and dopamine in experimental animals and in the rat this is associated with increased locomotor activity and the serotonin behavioural syndrome in rats. MDMA causes dose-dependent hyperthermia, which is potentially fatal, in humans, primates and rodents. Subsequent serotonergic neurotoxicity has been demonstrated by biochemical and histological studies and is reported to last for months in rats and years in non-human primates. Relating human data to findings in animals is complicated by reports that MDMA exposure in mice produces selective long-term dopaminergic impairment with no effect on serotonin. This review compares data obtained from animal and human studies and examines the acute physiological, behavioural and biochemical effects of MDMA as well as the long-term behavioural effects together with serotonergic and dopaminergic impairments. Consideration is also given to the role of neurotoxic metabolites and the influence of age, sex and user groups on the long-term actions of MDMA.

### Nicotine and Parkinson's disease: implications for therapy [^a612564d]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that nicotine, a drug that stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, may be of therapeutic value in Parkinson's disease. Beneficial effects may be several-fold. One of these is a protective action against nigrostriatal damage. This possibility stems from the results of epidemiological studies that consistently demonstrate an inverse correlation between tobacco use and Parkinson's disease. This reduced incidence of Parkinson's disease has been attributed to the nicotine in tobacco products, at least in part, based on experimental work showing a protective effect of nicotine against toxic insults. Second, several studies suggest a symptomatic effect of nicotine in Parkinson's disease, although effects are small and somewhat variable. Third, recent data in nonhuman primates show that nicotine attenuates levodopa-induced dyskinesias, a debilitating side effect that develops in the majority of patients on levodopa therapy. Collectively, these observations suggest that nicotine or CNS selective nicotinic receptor ligands hold promise for Parkinson's disease therapy to reduce disease progression, improve symptoms, and/or decrease levodopa-induced dyskinesias.

### Risky behaviors and parkinson disease: a mendelian randomization study [^4d286b0c]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The currently available treatment options for PD are symptomatic only. The lack of disease-modifying or protective treatments is due at least in part to the fact that the exact disease mechanisms are currently only partly understood.

The vast majority of cases of PD are caused by the combined action and likely interaction of genetic variants and environmental and lifestyle exposures. Several common habitual agents such as smoking, coffee intake, and alcohol drinking have shown protective associations with PD in large-scale meta-analyses of observational studies. Several recent studies have further shown beneficial effects of cannabidiol, a nonpsychotomimetic compound derived from cannabis, on nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD. It is noteworthy that several impulse control disorders such as gambling, hypersexuality, and compulsive eating are observed more frequently in patients with PD, with some studies reporting up to 40% prevalence in patients with PD. However, it is believed that these symptoms may be the result of dopamine agonist therapy prescribed to patients with PD. The imminent challenge in this context is to decipher whether these PD-associated environmental/lifestyle/behavioral variables contribute to or are an effect of the disease.

The recent development of the mendelian randomization (MR) approach allows investigators to judge causality on the basis of genetic data generated in observational studies. Specifically, this relies on the use of genetic variants as proxy markers of risk factors and takes care of confounding by exploiting random allocation of genetic variants at birth (for more details, see e-methods available from Dryad).

We have also seen a surge of MR studies in the field of PD specifically exploring the causal role of several circulating biomarkers. For example, a recent MR study reported a significant causal association with a lifelong PD risk reduction of 3% per 10-μg/dL increase in serum iron levels. Most recently, another study further reported a risk reduction of 18% with a lifetime exposure of 5-kg/m² higher body mass index.

### Drug-induced valvular heart disease [^b8a9984e]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Drug-induced valvular heart disease (DIVHD) was first described in the 1960s. Initially, associations with ergot derivatives used for migraine prevention, or with anorectic drugs, were described. Drugs used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and endocrine diseases, like hyperprolactinemia, may also induce VHD. More recently, the use of 3,4-methylendioxymetamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') and benfluorexhave been found to be associated with DIVHD. Although some of these drugs were withdrawn from the market, several cases of patients requiring valve surgery even years after the cessation of therapy have been reported. DIVHD is not infrequent, may be severe, and has been described in association with several drugs. Even after drug cessation, long-term implications of this type of VHD may persist. The present review underlines the need for a careful evaluation of the associated clinical and echocardiographic risk factors to allow early recognition so as not to delay appropriate management.

### Personality, addiction, dopamine: insights from Parkinson's disease [^ae280c2a]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

In rare instances, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may become addicted to their own medication or develop behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling. This is surprising because PD patients typically have a very low incidence of drug abuse and display a personality type that is the polar opposite of the addictive personality. These rare addictive syndromes, which appear to result from excessive dopaminergic medication use, illustrate the link between dopamine, personality, and addiction. We describe the clinical phenomena and attempt to relate them to current models of learning and addiction. We conclude that persistently elevated dopaminergic stimulation promotes the development and maintenance of addictive behaviors.

### "Ecstasy" and serotonin neurotoxicity… [^433bee0c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE ARTICLE by Reneman et al1 in this issue of the ARCHIVES is timely and provocative and highlights several areas of controversy in the fields of substance abuse, drug-induced neurotoxic effects, and neuroimaging. The authors present evidence that the illicit recreational drug 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine may cause persistent cognitive deficits2-9 and that these deficits are related to the extent of previous MDMA use. Based on single-photon emission computed tomography imaging with 123I-labeled 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-tropane, they conclude that MDMA causes neurotoxic injury to cortical serotonin axon terminals that may be reversible. This is the first study to evaluate a separate cohort of previous MDMA users who have abstained from use for longer than 1 year, and thus has the potential to provide information regarding long-term effects of exposure to MDMA.

### What to test in parkinson disease prevention trials? Repurposed, low-risk, and gene-targeted drugs [^4c6d6097]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prototypic Drug Candidates for Early PD Prevention Trials

Multiple key design elements of a PD prevention trial are just now beginning to come into focus, as reflected in the first convening of an international conference on planning for such trials this year. Nevertheless, early pharmacologic candidates may now be reasonably proposed for testing based on the above principles. Not only do they offer realistic prospects for slowing the pathophysiology of PD before diagnosis but proceeding with their testing may also be of great value in establishing proof-of-concept and a methodological foundation for future prevention trials. For example, the first PD prevention trials will provide the first practical experience addressing challenges of recruiting and retaining individuals to a long-term treatment trial when they are at risk for but not diagnosed with PD.

In this study, we describe several emerging examples of plausibly protective, repurposable, oral agents with relatively low risk of serious side effects. Their candidacies illustrate how epidemiologic links of common exposures to a reduced risk of idiopathic PD (caffeine, ibuprofen, and albuterol) may extend to a PD subtype associated with a specific population at risk for the disease (e.g. carriers of pathogenic LRRK2 or GBA variant or people with RBD).

Caffeine

The commonly consumed psychostimulant caffeine has been established as one of the most robust inverse risk factors (i.e. associations with "reduced risk") for PD, with dozens of epidemiologic studies reproducibly finding caffeine intake predictive of a lower risk of developing the disease (in prospective cohort studies) or likelihood of having it (in case-control studies). In addition, the biological plausibility that caffeine may be a mediator and a marker of reduced PD risk has been demonstrated consistently in various preclinical animal models of PD neurodegeneration, ranging from mitochondrial toxin to genetic (α-synuclein) models and from invertebrate to rodent models. Although its proximal mechanism of neuroprotective action is likely through its potent antagonism of endogenous adenosine at A₂A receptors (Figure), this blockade may in turn disrupt several pathways underlying PD pathophysiology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammation, autophagy, and other α-synuclein toxicities.

### Postsynaptic synucleins mediate endocannabinoid signaling [^ab7b1983]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Endocannabinoids are among the most powerful modulators of synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system, and yet little is understood about the release of endocannabinoids from postsynaptic compartments. Here we report an unexpected finding that endocannabinoid release requires synucleins, key contributors to Parkinson's disease. We show that endocannabinoids are released postsynaptically by a synuclein-dependent and SNARE-dependent mechanism. Specifically, we found that synuclein deletion blocks endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity; this block is reversed by postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not of mutant α-synuclein. Whole-cell recordings and direct optical monitoring of endocannabinoid signaling suggest that the synuclein deletion specifically blocks endocannabinoid release. Given the presynaptic role of synucleins in regulating vesicle lifecycle, we hypothesize that endocannabinoids are released via a membrane interaction mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynaptic expression of tetanus toxin light chain, which cleaves synaptobrevin SNAREs, also blocks endocannabinoid-dependent signaling. The unexpected finding that endocannabinoids are released via a synuclein-dependent mechanism is consistent with a general function of synucleins in membrane trafficking and adds a piece to the longstanding puzzle of how neurons release endocannabinoids to induce synaptic plasticity.

### Parkinsonism in patients with a history of amphetamine exposure [^79084bd3]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

We recently found a higher rate of prolonged amphetamine exposure in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in spouse/caregiver controls. Since distinguishing features have been described in some patients with parkinsonism due to environment exposures (e.g., manganese), we sought to compare the clinical features of patients with PD with prolonged amphetamine exposure with unexposed patients with PD. Prolonged exposure was defined as a minimum of twice a week for ≥ 3 months, or weekly use ≥ 1 year. We reviewed the clinical records of patients with PD who had participated in a telephone survey of drug and environmental exposures and compared the clinical features of patients with a history of prolonged amphetamine exposure to patients who had no such exposure. Records were available for 16 of 17 (94%) patients with prior amphetamine exposure and 127 of 137 (92%) of those unexposed. Age at diagnosis was younger in the amphetamine-exposed group (49.8 ± 8.2 years vs. 53.1 ± 7.4 years; P < 0.05), but other features, including presenting symptoms, initial and later treatments, development of motor fluctuations, and MRI findings were similar between these groups. Because we did not detect clinical features that differentiate parkinsonism in patients with prolonged amphetamine exposure, research to determine whether amphetamine exposure is a risk factor for parkinsonism will require detailed histories of medication and recreational drug use.

### An artist's view of drug-induced hallucinosis [^e6a528de]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

The occurrence of hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease is often related to antiparkinsonian therapy, but other factors such as cognitive decline and sleep-cycle disturbances are thought to contribute. We describe an artist who depicted her visual hallucinations experienced in the course of Parkinson's disease.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^b6819c43]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

APA practice guideline — Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are defined by whether Parkinson's disease precedes cognitive impairment by more than 1 year (Parkinson's disease dementia) or whether cognitive impairment is the dominant symptom (dementia with Lewy bodies), and whether these entities are one condition or distinct ones remains unresolved. Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurological condition characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability with onset typically in middle to late life. In one large longitudinal study, dementia developed in nearly 80% of patients followed for 8 years. The dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and slow progression with cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairments in memory retrieval and flexibility; Parkinson's disease is important to psychiatrists because of the high prevalence of associated depression and the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms such as visual hallucinations during pharmacological treatment of the primary motor deficit.

### Meta-analysis of executive functioning in ecstasy / polydrug users [^83cd7f75]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) remains popular despite reports of potential long-term negative consequences associated with repeated use (see Parrott). Furthermore, ecstasy poses a major public health concern due to an increase in recent MDMA-related deaths (Anderson,) as well as reported increases in tablet strength, with some sources suggesting tablets may contain upwards of 200 mg of MDMA (Global Drugs Survey; Winstock). Animal literature suggests that ecstasy causes damage to serotonin axons (Ricaurte et al; Molliver et al.). There is also evidence of ecstasy-related alterations in mood (Curran et al.) and long-term changes in neuroendocrine function (Wetherell & Montgomery). However, perhaps public health warnings are not being taken seriously due to mixed messages in the media and scientific literature about relative harms of drugs (for assessment of drug-related harms, which poorly correlate with UK drug classification, see Nutt et al.).

### Meta-analysis of executive functioning in ecstasy / polydrug users [^5f66af87]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To conclude, the current meta-analysis demonstrated that EF performance in ecstasy users is significantly reduced overall compared with controls. The three functions that show significant impairment are updating, switching and access, whilst inhibitory control is unaffected by ecstasy use. This is the most comprehensive analysis of EF in ecstasy users to date and provides a behavioural correlate of potential serotonergic neurotoxicity.

Table 1.
In vitro monoamine release and re-uptake data. All values are in µM. Re-uptake data is the IC50 value for uptake inhibition, unless otherwise specified. The number in brackets represents the reference from which the data is taken (see bottom of table). Release data is the EC50 value.

In humans and rats, MDMA use produces a reduction in serotonergic markers, characterised by a decrease in serotonin transporter (SERT) binding sites as well as a decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the major metabolite of 5-HT, in human cerebrospinal fluid, but not in the plasma. Additionally, post-synaptic 5-HT₂ receptor sites are increased. Meta-analyses byandfound that these alterations in serotonin binding sites achieved significance in heavy MDMA users (> 50 lifetime usage), but that these results were not conclusive in studies examining moderate users. While the exact mechanisms underlying these neurotoxic effects remain poorly understood, it is known that in rats they depend on both DA and 5-HT modulation, as well as autophagy. At high doses, MDMA can also cause the degeneration of 5-HT nerve terminals. This process is believed to be mediated through a combination of oxidative stress, metabolic compromise and inflammation.

### Neuroimaging findings with MDMA / ecstasy: technical aspects, conceptual issues and future prospects [^27783f8c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Users of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) may be at risk of developing MDMA-induced injury to the serotonin (5-HT) system. Previously, there were no methods available for directly evaluating the neurotoxic effects of MDMA in the living human brain. However, development of in vivoneuroimaging tools have begun to provide insights into the effects of ecstasy on the human brain. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission computed tomography (PET) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies which have evaluated ecstasy's neurotoxic potential will be reviewed and discussed in terms of technical aspects, conceptual issues and future prospects. Although PET and SPECT may be limited by several factors such as the low cortical uptake and the use of a non-optimal reference region (cerebellum) the few studies conducted so far provide suggestive evidence that people who heavily use ecstasy are at risk of developing subcortical, and probably also cortical reductions in serotonin transporter (SERT) densities, a marker of 5-HT neurotoxicity. There seem to be dose-dependent and transient reductions in SERT for which females may be more vulnerable than males. 1H-MRS appears to be a less sensitive technique for studying ecstasy's neurotoxic potential. Whether individuals with a relatively low ecstasy exposure also demonstrate loss of SERT needs to be determined. Because most studies have had a retrospective design, in which evidence is indirect and differs in the degree to which any causal links can be implied, longitudinal studies in human ecstasy users are needed to draw definite conclusions.

### The disease intersection of susceptibility and exposure: chemical exposures and neurodegenerative disease risk [^56cc7e7d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2014). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease, the most common of the late-life neurodegenerative disorders, are in most cases thought to have complex etiologies. Common features among these disorders include insidious onset, pathological findings of protein aggregates and selected neuronal degeneration, and resulting characteristic clinical syndromes. The number of elders in the United States, including aging veterans, is increasing. Investigation of causes and preventive interventions for neurodegenerative disorders is increasingly relevant. Recent epidemiological and laboratory studies suggest that exposures years or decades before diagnosis can trigger the processes that ultimately result in a neurodegenerative disease. If this is correct, preventive measures may be needed in midlife or earlier. This article will focus on putative risk factors relevant to military service.

### The confounding problem of polydrug use in recreational ecstasy / MDMA users: a brief overview [^803d383f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The popular dance drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — MDMA) is neurotoxic upon central serotonergic neurons in laboratory animals and possibly also in humans. In recent years, several studies reported alterations of serotonergic transmission and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in ecstasy users which might be related to MDMA-induced neurotoxic brain damage. To date, the most consistent findings associate subtle cognitive, particularly memory, deficits with heavy ecstasy use. However, most studies have important inherent methodological problems. One of the most serious confounds is the widespread pattern of polydrug use which makes it dif.cult to relate the findings in user populations to one specific drug. The present paper represents a brief overview on this issue. The most commonly co-used substances are alcohol, cannabis and stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine). Stimulants are also neurotoxic upon both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. Hence, they may act synergistically with MDMA and enhance its long-term adverse effects. The interactions between MDMA and cannabis use may be more complex: cannabis use is a well-recognized risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders and it was shown to contribute to psychological problems and cognitive failures in ecstasy users. However, at the cellular level, cannabinoids have neuroprotective actions and they were shown to (partially) block MDMA-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals. In future, longitudinal and prospective research designs should hopefully lead to a better understanding of the relation between drug use and subclinical psychological symptoms or neurocognitive failures and, also, of questions around interactions between the various substances of abuse.

### Restless legs syndrome and Parkinson's disease: is there an etiologic link? [^deb2531d]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The etiologic link between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been debated. Since dopaminergic dysfunction and response to dopaminergic agents are consistent features in RLS and PD, some authors have suggested that these two diseases may share common pathophysiology. However, presently there is not enough evidence to suggest that the actual pathophysiologic mechanism in both diseases is identical. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is primarily involved in PD and it is possible that the extrastriatal dopaminergic system may be variably involved in those PD patients with RLS symptoms. Further clinical, imaging, pharmacologic, and genetic studies will be needed to address the many unanswered questions related to the link between RLS and PD.

### Levodopa gains psychostimulant-like properties after nigral dopaminergic loss [^fb58bfe3]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Dopamine dysregulation syndrome shares some core behavioral features with psychostimulant addiction, suggesting that dopamine replacement therapy can acquire psychostimulantlike properties in some patients with Parkinson disease (PD). We here report strong experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis in an α-synuclein rat model of PD. Although levodopa had no effect in controls, it acquired 2 prominent psychostimulantlike properties in Parkinsonian rats: (1) it produced intense reward on its own and in parallel (2) decreased interest in other nondrug reward. These 2 effects may combine to explain the addictive use of levodopa after loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in some PD patients.

### Beyond ecstasy: alternative entactogens to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine with potential applications in psychotherapy [^91a2a7ef]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Some studies have also explored the ability of 4-FA to release neurotransmitters from preloaded cells (Table 1). In rat brain synaptosomes, 4-FA was found to potently induce the release of monoamines, with its ability to release [³H]NE being about twice as high as its ability to release [³H]DA, and its ability to release [³H]DA being about 20 times higher than its ability to release [³H]5-HT. Once again, there is some inconsistency with the older literature, where it was found that [³H]NE was released five times more potently than [³H]DA, which, in turn, was released about four times more potently than [³H]5-HT. The relative potencies of [³H]NE > [³H]DA > [³H]5-HT were maintained, however. Finally, 4-FA was also found to be a partial agonist of 5-HT₁A, 5-HT₂A and 5-HT₂C receptors.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: a systematic review [^6cb6d44b]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine (MA), also known as crystal meth, is a synthetic stimulant that affects the brain and central nervous system. Smoking is the most common route of administration for MA. When smoked or injected, it produces an initial rush that lasts only a couple of minutes but is intensely pleasurable. This is followed by a prolonged high that results in an extended period of euphoria. The half-life of MA ranges from 10–30 hours depending on the purity of the drug, urine pH, and the amount consumed. Like other psychoactive drugs of abuse, chronic MA use can result in tolerance, where increased amounts of MA are required to produce the same high.

Because MA is a stimulant, it produces physiological and psychological effects similar to those elicited by cocaine. MA stimulates the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and blocks their reuptake. This excess amount of neurotransmitters in the synapses produces sensations of euphoria, lowered inhibitions, feelings of invincibility, increased wakefulness, heightened sexual experiences, and hyperactivity resulting from increased energy for extended periods of time. Deleterious short-term effects include increased heart and respiration rates, hyperthermia, chest pain, hypertension, increased respiration, decreased appetite, anorexia, irritability, confusion, tremors, convulsions, anxiety, aggressiveness, and symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and paranoia. This is followed by mental and physical exhaustion, headaches, irritability, reduced concentration, hunger, decreased energy, anhedonia, and a craving for more MA. Cognitive impairments and changes in the brain that result in symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease can occur. Long-term use of MA use is associated with neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and clinical depression that may lead to homicidal and suicidal ideation and action.

### Exploring the link between dopamine dysregulation and eating disorders: a narrative review [^84c07e1a]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of eating disorders (ED), such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorders, is on the rise, and it is imperative to explore the pathophysiological aspects and associations of these disorders to provide better and precise treatment. Dopamine is an essential hormone and a neurotransmitter involved in an array of processes and pathways. Disruption of any of the dopamine pathways can lead to diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, schizophrenia, or anhedonia. The mesolimbic pathway of dopamine has a special association with the feeding behavior of a person, and disruption of this pathway has been shown to be associated with ED. In this article, we comprehensively assess the relation between dopamine and ED and discuss the clinical implications involving the pharmacological associations of drugs influencing dopamine levels and their impact on the treatment of ED.

### Neuroprotection of low dose carbon monoxide in Parkinson's disease models commensurate with the reduced risk of Parkinson's among smokers [^7bff4580]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting an estimated 10 million individuals worldwide. While currently available therapies mitigate signs of disease, none of these limit neurodegeneration or alter the devastating course of the disease. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the formation and spread of alpha-synuclein (αSyn)-rich aggregates, called Lewy bodies, which have been proposed to induce degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Epidemiological research has identified smoking tobacco as the factor most consistently correlated with the reduction in both the risk for developing PD, and the development of Lewy-body-related neuropathology. These findings prompted the investigation into the therapeutic potential of tobacco smoke components, particularly nicotine. To date, however, nicotine has failed to mitigate PD symptoms or stall progression of disease in human clinical trials. Thus, other tobacco smoke constituents warrant evaluation.

One plausible, if paradoxical, candidate that has yet to be considered is carbon monoxide (CO). The concentration of hemoglobin-bound CO (CO-Hb) is intermittently higher in the blood of smokers compared to non-smokers, at levels usually below 10% that are well below those typically associated with the well-documented clinical or epidemiological toxicity of CO –. Rather, at these levels, CO can activate cytoprotective signaling cascades mediated by Nrf2 and HIF-1α, which can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation –. In vitro, low-dose CO also increases expression of Nurr-1, a transcription factor critical to the survival and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. Notably, overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective Nrf-2 and stress-induced enzyme that produces endogenous CO, has been found to protect dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxicity in an animal model of PD. Given the potential for CO to underlie the reduced risk of PD among smokers and to activate neuroprotective signaling, we hypothesized that low-dose CO might confer protection in rodent models of PD and that smokers might display higher levels of neuroprotective signaling factors.

### Environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease: a critical review and policy implications [^b256cf1f]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential link between PD and TCE has gained more attention and evidence in recent years with a few case studies, and a small twin study in 2012 showed that TCE exposure was linked to a higher risk of PD (OR = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.2–33). More recently, compelling evidence of a link between volatile solvents (including TCE) and PD was published from a cohort study of > 340,000 American military service members showing a 70% (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.39–2.07) higher risk of PD among veterans stationed at a camp with water contaminated with volatile solvents during 1975–1985.PD diagnosis was based on medical record review (not clinical evaluation) and associations were attenuated when restricted to cases ascertained before 2017 (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.00–1.64). This was the year the US Congress and Veterans Administration designated PD a presumptive service‐connected condition for veterans who served at Camp Lejeune from 1953 to 1987, making them eligible for benefits.

Animal studies demonstrate that after oral administration of TCE there is a selective and dose‐dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as α‐syn inclusions in the SN and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Additionally, rats exposed to chronic TCE inhalation had degradation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, α‐syn accumulation in dopaminergic neurons, and showed motor and gait impairments. Similar to rotenone, the main effects of TCE could be attributed to a reduction in mitochondrial complex I enzyme activity. Of relevance to potential GxE is the finding of increased LRRK2‐activity in the nigrostriatal tract of orally TCE‐exposed rats and an impairment of endolysosomal function.

The available literature regarding an association between TCE and PD is lacking evidence for specificity and dose–response but shows consistency in other categories (ie, experiment, strength, consistency, and plausibility) (Table 3). Considering the large number of individuals worldwide that have been and still are being exposed to TCE, further studies are needed to understand the potential hazardous effects of TCE and its link to PD. However, monitoring systems for detecting TCE contamination in developing countries are sparse.

### Benzylpiperazine: a drug of abuse? [^f2bd9608]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

N-benzylpiperazine (BZP) is the active ingredient in recreational 'party' or 'p.e.p'. pills, which are used to provide a stimulant, euphoric effect akin to that of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'). BZP predominantly affects dopamine neurotransmission in a similar fashion to known 'drugs of abuse', such as methamphetamine and cocaine, which strongly suggests BZP has abuse liability. BZP is illegal in many countries including the United States of America and Australia, yet it remains legal in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. There has been little research, to date, on the neurological consequences of high dose or chronic exposure of BZP. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the information currently available on BZP and suggest a need for further research into the mechanisms of action, long-term effects and potentially addictive properties of BZP.

### Are ecstasy induced serotonergic alterations overestimated for the majority of users? [^7c78cf8b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroimaging studies imply that the regular use of ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the major constituent of ecstasy pills, alters the brain's serotonergic system in a dose-dependent manner. However, the relevance of these findings remains unclear due to limited knowledge about the ecstasy/MDMA use pattern of real-life users.

Aims

We examined the representativeness of ecstasy users enrolled in neuroimaging studies by comparing their ecstasy use habits with the use patterns of a large, international sample.

Methods

A systematic literature search revealed 10 imaging studies that compare serotonin transporter levels in recreational ecstasy users to matched controls. To characterize the ecstasy use patterns we relied on the Global Drug Survey, the world's largest self-report database on drug use. The basis of the dose comparison were the Usual Amount (pills/session), Use Frequency (sessions/month) and Dose Intensity (pills/year) variables.

Results

Both the average Usual Amount (pills/session) and Use Frequency (sessions/month) of neuroimaging study participants corresponded to the top 5–10% of the Global Drug Survey sample and imaging participants, on average, consumed 720% more pills over a year than the Global Drug Survey participants.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the serotonin brain imaging literature has focused on unusually heavy ecstasy use and therefore the conclusions from these studies are likely to overestimate the extent of serotonergic alterations experienced by the majority of people who use ecstays.

The popular dance drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: MDMA and some analogues) causes selective and persistent neurotoxic damage of central serotonergic neurones in laboratory animals. Serotonin plays a role in numerous functional systems in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, various abnormalities including psychiatric, vegetative, neuroendocrine and cognitive disorders could be expected in humans following MDMA-induced neurotoxic brain damage.

Aims

In recent years, the question of ecstasy-induced neurotoxicity and possible functional sequelae has been addressed in several studies with drug users. The aim of this paper was to review this literature and weigh the strength of the evidence for persistent brain damage in ecstasy users.

Methods

We used Medline to view all available publications on 'ecstasy' or 'MDMA'. All available studies dealing with ecstasy users entered this analysis.

Findings and Conclusions

Despite large methodological problems the bulk of evidence suggests residual alterations of serotonergic transmission in MDMA users, although at least partial restitution may occur after long-term abstinence. However, functional sequelae may persist even after longer periods of abstinence. To date, the most consistent findings associate subtle cognitive, particularly memory, impairments with heavy ecstasy use. However, the evidence cannot be considered definite and the issues of possible pre-existing traits or the effects of polydrug use are not resolved.

Recommendations

Questions about the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy on the brain remain highly topical in light of its popularity among young people. More longitudinal and prospective studies are clearly needed in order to obtain a better understanding of the possible long-term sequelae of ecstasy use in humans.

### Ecstasy, the serotonin syndrome, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome – A possible link? [^480425dd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — We read with interest the report on 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. 1 The toxic effects of this drug — hyperthermia, autonomic instability, increased motor restlessness, and death by renal failure — appear to be similar to certain features of both the "serotonin syndrome"2 and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The serotonin syndrome has been reported in depressed patients who are taking a combination of medications that enhance central nervous system serotonin function such as tryptophan, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other antidepressant medications. The most frequently reported symptoms that comprise the syndrome are changes in mental status, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. The precise etiology of the syndrome is unclear, although some evidence supports the theory that it is caused by hyperstimulation of the 5-HT1A receptor in the brainstem and spinal cord.

### Association of study characteristics with estimates of effect size in studies of ecstasy use [^3d2903fb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Studies of the chronic effects of MDMA, or 'ecstasy', in humans have been largely inconsistent. We explored whether study-level characteristics are associated with the effect size estimate reported. We based our analyses on the recent systematic review by Rogers and colleagues, focusing on those meta-analyses within this report where there was a relatively large number of studies contributing to each individual meta-analysis. Linear regression was used to investigate the association between study level variables and effect size estimate, weighted by the inverse of the SE of the effect size estimate, with cluster correction for studies which contributed multiple estimates. This indicated an association between effect size estimate and both user group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting former users compared with those recruiting current users, and control group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting polydrug user controls compared with those recruiting drug-naïve controls. In addition, increasing year of publication was associated with reduced effect size estimate, and there was a trend level association with prevalence of ecstasy use, reflecting smaller estimates among studies conducted in countries with higher prevalence of ecstasy use. Our data suggest a number of study-level characteristics which appear to influence individual study effect size estimates. These should be considered when designing future studies, and also when interpreting the ecstasy literature as a whole.

### Comparative proteomic analysis highlights metabolic dysfunction in α-synucleinopathy [^66e6b992]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Disease-causing mutations that affect the levels or sequence of α-synuclein correlate well with the presence of α-synuclein aggregation in postmortem brains from Parkinson's disease patients. However, α-synuclein mutations are rare. Most genetic variation promoting the development and progression of Parkinson's disease derives from loci with lower penetrance. Concerted efforts to identify such variants through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have resulted in almost 100 loci implicated in the genetic risk for Parkinson's disease. Examination of the molecular function of the proteins encoded by these loci does not immediately suggest precisely how variants at these loci promote α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity.

Interestingly, an apparent gap also exists between the function of proteins implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis by GWAS and the wealth of prior experimentation defining the pathophysiological basis of the disorder. Motivated by early work noting the clinical similarities between recreational drug users exposed to the mitochondrial complex I toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridineand patients with Parkinson's disease, a large body of experimental work has implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in the disorder. More recently, rare familial forms of Parkinson's disease linked to mutations in genes encoding the proteins parkin and PINK1, which control mitochondrial dynamics and function have been identified.

There is therefore a critical need to understand the mechanisms by which increased levels of wild-type α-synuclein, or mutations affecting the coding region of the protein, exert toxicity in Parkinson's disease, with the goal of developing a comprehensive understanding of disease pathogenesis to support rational drug design. Proteomic analysis represents a powerful approach for biological discovery. The development of high-resolution mass spectrometers coupled with quantitative labeling and multiplexing strategies has increased the utility of the approach. Here we have further incorporated integration with human genetic data and comparative proteomics with a second neurodegenerative disease model to enhance our ability to define mechanisms mediating α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Our results highlight Gch1 and folate as critical factors controlling α-synuclein neurotoxicity through downstream effects on mitochondrial function.

### Widening the spectrum of risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of parkinson disease [^76967f33]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Given the size and study period, we believe that this case-control study has generated valuable hypotheses on the associations found between PD and certain risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal symptoms in a representative population. These associations may reflect possible early extrastriatal and extracerebral pathology of PD due to shared genetic risk with PD, medication exposure, or direct causation, or represent pathophysiologically relevant factors contributing to the pathogenesis of PD. Subtle associations require future testing in prospective controlled studies.

### Low striatal serotonin transporter protein in a human polydrug MDMA (ecstasy) user: a case study [^502ce9af]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence that the widely used methamphetamine analog MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) might damage brain serotonin neurones in humans is derived from imaging investigations showing variably decreased binding of radioligands to the serotonin transporter (SERT), a marker of serotonin neurones. However, in humans, it is not known whether low SERT binding reflects actual loss of SERT protein itself. As this question can only be answered in post-mortem brain, we measured protein levels of SERT and that of the rate-limiting serotonin-synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in autopsied brain of a high-dose MDMA user. As compared with control values, SERT protein levels were markedly (-48% to -58%) reduced in striatum (caudate, putamen) and occipital cortex and less affected (-25%) in frontal and temporal cortices, whereas TPH protein was severely decreased in caudate and putamen (-68% and -95%, respectively). The magnitude of the striatal SERT protein reduction was greater than the SERT binding decrease typically reported in imaging studies. Although acknowledging limitations of a case study, these findings extend imaging data based on SERT binding and suggest that high-dose MDMA exposure could cause loss of two key protein markers of brain serotonin neurones, a finding compatible with either physical damage to serotonin neurones or downregulation of components therein.

### Sustained effects of ecstasy on the human brain: a prospective neuroimaging study in novel users [^489a1958]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested toxic effects of recreational ecstasy use on the serotonin system of the brain. However, it cannot be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. As part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, we prospectively assessed sustained effects of ecstasy use on the brain in novel ecstasy users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. At baseline, 188 ecstasy-naive volunteers with high probability of first ecstasy use were examined. After a mean period of 17 months follow-up, neuroimaging was repeated in 59 incident ecstasy users and 56 matched persistent ecstasy-naives and their outcomes were compared. Neuroimaging included [(123)I]beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (CIT) SPECT to measure serotonin transporter densities as indicators of serotonergic function; (1)H-MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites as indicators of neuronal damage; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusional motion of water molecules in the brain as indicators of axonal integrity; and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) to measure regional relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) which indicates brain perfusion. With this approach, both structural ((1)H-MRS and DTI) and functional ([(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT and PWI) aspects of neurotoxicity were combined. Compared to persistent ecstasy-naives, novel low-dose ecstasy users (mean 6.0, median 2.0 tablets) showed decreased rrCBV in the globus pallidus and putamen; decreased FA in thalamus and frontoparietal white matter; increased FA in globus pallidus; and increased apparent diffusion coefficient in the thalamus. No changes in serotonin transporter densities and brain metabolites were observed. These findings suggest sustained effects of ecstasy on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation and possibly axonal damage due to low dosages of ecstasy. Although we do not know yet whether these effects are reversible or not, we cannot exclude that ecstasy even in low doses is neurotoxic to the brain.

### Meta-analysis of executive functioning in ecstasy / polydrug users [^f96b223b]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Ecstasy/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is proposed to cause damage to serotonergic (5-HT) axons in humans. Therefore, users should show deficits in cognitive processes that rely on serotonin-rich, prefrontal areas of the brain. However, there is inconsistency in findings to support this hypothesis. The aim of the current study was to examine deficits in executive functioning in ecstasy users compared with controls using meta-analysis. We identified k = 39 studies, contributing 89 effect sizes, investigating executive functioning in ecstasy users and polydrug-using controls. We compared function-specific task performance in 1221 current ecstasy users and 1242 drug-using controls, from tasks tapping the executive functions – updating, switching, inhibition and access to long-term memory. The significant main effect demonstrated overall executive dysfunction in ecstasy users [standardized mean difference (SMD) = −0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.26 to −0.11, Z = 5.05, p < 0.001, I² = 82%], with a significant subgroup effect (χ² = 22.06, degrees of freedom = 3, p < 0.001, I² = 86.4%) demonstrating differential effects across executive functions. Ecstasy users showed significant performance deficits in access (SMD = −0.33, 95% CI −0.46 to −0.19, Z = 4.72, p < 0.001, I² = 74%), switching (SMD = −0.19, 95% CI −0.36 to −0.02, Z = 2.16, p < 0.05, I² = 85%) and updating (SMD = −0.26, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.15, Z = 4.49, p < 0.001, I² = 82%). No differences were observed in inhibitory control. We conclude that this is the most comprehensive analysis of executive function in ecstasy users to date and provides a behavioural correlate of potential serotonergic neurotoxicity.

### Risky behaviors and parkinson disease: a mendelian randomization study [^c3448da6]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

A brief explanation of MR methods in general is given in e-methods available from Dryad.

Study design and identification of datasets

We conducted a 2-sample MR using summary-level estimates to explore the causal role of several risky behaviors on PD. We identified genetic instruments that influence risky behaviors using a recently published meta-analysis of GWAS datasets on risky behaviors. The study reported statistically significant associations of 611 independent loci (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸) in a discovery cohort in up to 939,908 individuals of European ancestry with 6 highly correlated risky behavior phenotypes, including general risk tolerance, adventurousness, automobile speeding propensity, drinks per week, ever vs never smoking, and number of sexual partners. The study further defined general risk tolerance as the willingness to take risks, adventurousness as the self-reported tendency to be adventurous vs cautious, automobile speeding propensity as the tendency to drive faster than the speed limit, drinks per week as the average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week, ever smoker (tendency to smoke) as whether one has ever been a smoker, and lastly number of sexual partners as the lifetime number of sexual partners.

We further extracted summary estimates of the identified genetic variants from the discovery cohort of a recent meta-analysis of GWAS on 9,581 cases with PD and 33, 245 controls of European ancestry. For this, we used data available on the PDGene database. Genetic instruments were identified for smoking (cigarettes per day), smoking initiation, smoking cessation, cannabis dependence, pathologic gambling, and alcohol and coffee consumption from independent GWAS as a part of our secondary analyses.

### Entacapone [^bb09191a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with entacapone because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of entacapone (see PRECAUTIONS).

 Impulse Control and Compulsive Behaviors

Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including entacapone taken with levodopa and carbidopa. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping entacapone if a patient develops such urges while taking entacapone.

### A perhaps unexpected role of norepinephrine in actions of MDMA [^b932c683]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

In this issue, Hysek and colleagues present new data describing the impact of treatment with reboxetine on the effects produced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") in human volunteers. They demonstrate that several effects of MDMA are mediated by reboxetine's actions on norepinephrine (NE) transporters, an unexpected finding. Building on earlier work, their new data provide new insights into the pharmacodynamics of MDMA and other monoamine-releasing agents.

### Fatal and non-fatal health incidents related to recreational ecstasy use [^7c5154bd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Scientific reports, published between January 2000–April 2019, were retrieved using systematic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar. However, it appeared that only very limited data could be retrieved via PubMed. Only studies on fatal and non-fatal incidents with enough subjects (n > 5000) to adequately estimate the prevalence of last year ecstasy use in that population were included. Case reports, case series, ED reports and (other) papers not reporting exposure data, like last-year use prevalence, were regarded as inappropriate for our purpose. Throughout the text, acute adverse health incidents are defined as incidents, whereas severe incidents required medical stabilization at an ICU. One ecstasy pill is synonymous with one tablet of ecstasy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids… [^af48c402]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. 1). Acute pain, a nearly universal experience, is a physiologic response to noxious stimuli that can become pathologic. Acute pain is usually sudden in onset and time limited and often is caused by injury, trauma, or medical treatments such as surgery. Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk.

A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks, and many insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies have enacted similar policies. At least 17 states have passed laws requiring or recommending the coprescription of naloxone in the presence of overdose risk factors, such as high dosages of opioids or concomitant opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines.

This clinical practice guideline follows the Institute of Medicine's definition of palliative care as care that provides relief from pain and other symptoms, supports quality of life, and is focused on patients with serious advanced illness, intermediate-term and long-term outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of tramadol, effects of naloxone coprescription, risks of coprescribed benzodiazepines, risks of coprescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis.

### Meta-analysis of executive functioning in ecstasy / polydrug users [^54e12274]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Neuronal regions implicated in working memory and EF include the DLPFC and the hippocampus (depending on the nature of the task). These structures have dense innervation of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons (Pazos et al; Curtis & D'Esposito). Therefore ecstasy-related degradation to the serotonin system, through neurotoxicity or down-regulation following chronic recent use, is understood to be a potential cause of cognitive impairment in the functions supported by these areas. If ecstasy is a serotonin-specific neurotoxin in humans as it is in animals (Green et al.), one would expect functional alterations following repeated use. Several molecular imaging studies in human ecstasy users suggest a reduction in pre-synaptic serotonin transporter (SERT) availability in areas including the frontal cortex (McCann et al; Kish et al.) and the DLPFC (McCann et al.). Increases in post-synaptic 5-HT 2A receptors have also been observed in ecstasy users relative to controls in the DLPFC (Urban et al.). Decreased pre-synaptic SERT and increased post-synaptic 5-HT 2A receptor availability are consistent with serotonin axon damage. Moreover, functional neuroimaging studies have observed ecstasy-related adjustments to cerebral blood flow in frontal areas, with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (Roberts & Montgomery,) and fMRI (Moeller et al; Jager et al; Roberts & Garavan). It is noteworthy that all of the functional imaging studies mentioned observe increased neuronal activity to achieve similar behavioural performance to controls. This suggests that molecular and functional neuroimaging detect changes in serotonin signalling which cause future deficits in EF. The current results support this by demonstrating behavioural correlates for the supposed neuronal degradation.

Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping Comtan if a patient develops such urges while taking Comtan.

- consider offering sildenafil 50–100 mg 1 hour before sex in patients with Parkinson's disease with ED

- consider offering other drugs, such as tadalafil 10 mg 30 min-12 hours before sex, or vardenafil 10 mg 1 hour before sex as alternative choices

- consider administering apomorphine injections 5–10 min before sex as an alternative option in some patients

- consider administering intracavernous injections of papaverine or alprostadil in selected patients.

### Beyond ecstasy: alternative entactogens to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine with potential applications in psychotherapy [^ffc39e2a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

For the purpose of this review, compounds were chosen whose pharmacology is consistent with the above neurobiological effects, and whose safety profile is not inferior to that of MDMA. Firstly, compounds must not show indications of being more neurotoxic than MDMA. In the past, much of the resistance to studying MDMA in humans, with the aim of developing it into a medicine, has stemmed from concerns that it may have intolerable long-term neurotoxic effects. While it is now clear that many of the earlier concerns of human neurotoxicity were exaggerated and that administering therapeutic doses of MDMA in a clinical environment probably does not cause long-term adverse effects to patients, the neurotoxic potential of other MDMA-like drugs nevertheless remains an important concern and must be evaluated carefully in each case. This is a very important requirement, as this is a key factor for determining the safety of patients and whether a compound can be expected to be approved for medical use by regulatory authorities. Consequently, compounds which are less neurotoxic than MDMA were actively sought out. Additionally, MDMA-like entactogens that seem to produce less cardiovascular stress were also searched for. Compounds were also excluded if they did not possess in vitro pharmacology indicative of potent neuronal 5-HT modulation together with catecholamine modulation of at least one of the neurotransmitters DA or NE.

### Intensity dependence of auditory evoked dipole source activity in polydrug ecstasy users: evidence from an 18 months longitudinal study [^5d3d3b29]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Numerous animal studies have been able to demonstrate neurotoxic damage to central serotonergic systems after exposure to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). It has been suggested that a high loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) and, particularly, of the tangential N1/P2 source activity is associated with a low functioning of serotonergic activity. Therefore, the LDAEP may be used as a non-invasive indicator for a possible neurotoxic damage caused by the long-term use of ecstasy in recreational users. We recorded auditory evoked potentials (AEP) with a passive listening paradigm in 18 polydrug ecstasy users at baseline (t1) and after 18 months (t2). Several aspects of ecstasy use, such as frequency of use, cumulative lifetime dose or period of abstinence were associated with the LDAEP for several tangential dipoles at both measuring times. However, we failed to demonstrate any significant relationship between drug use reported at follow-up and AEP changes from baseline to follow-up. Despite some incertitude these data suggest, yet do not unambiguously con.rm, the hypothesis that abstinent ecstasy users present with diminished central serotonergic activity. This feature of information processing is potentially related to the neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. However, alternative interpretations of these data refer to possible preexisting traits and the potential impact of other illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine, since ecstasy users typically exhibit polydrug use patterns. Thus, further research with larger sample sizes and prospective study designs are needed to definitively establish a causative link between ecstasy use and neurotoxicity-related dysfunctions in sensory processing.

### Fatal and non-fatal health incidents related to recreational ecstasy use [^d4d3d314]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatal incidents

The current study shows that the risk of a fatal incident following the use of solely MDMA in England/Wales and Scotland was the same: one in 33,000 pills (0.003%). However, the risk of MRDs irrespective of poly- vs mono-drug use was six-fold higher in Scotland than in England and Wales (0.03% vs 0.005%), suggesting regional differences in the concurrent use of other substances or riskier behaviour in Scotland (higher and more frequent dosing, unfavourable setting). Indeed, results from the GDS, 2017 survey suggest that ecstasy is used more often in Scotland (14.5 days per year) than in the UK as a whole (11.8 days per year). However, the GDS surveys are selected samples with relatively many clubbers which may lead to an over-estimation of use and an under-estimation of the risk. Also some (relatively more) under-reporting in England and Wales cannot be excluded, because MRDs are defined in England and Wales as 'text search identified ecstasy written on death certificate' i.e. toxicological examinations are not necessarily carried out, whereas in Scotland MRDs are based on (a) what drugs were thought to be implicated in or contributing to the death, and (b) what other drugs were identified post mortem, which may result in a lower number of (false positive) MRDs.

### Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of Parkinson's disease: nested case-control study [^330ccf28]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Ascertainment of Parkinson's disease

We identified all participants who reported a new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease on their annual survey between 1982 and 2008. To evaluate the accuracy of the self reporting of Parkinson's disease, we performed a validation study using the available medical records of 73 participants who indicated a new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In the Physicians' Health Study, medical records were obtained for each reported study outcome (cardiac event, transient ischaemic attack, stroke, cancer, pulmonary embolism or death). A physician (JAD) evaluated the medical records of participants who reported Parkinson's disease before developing an outcome event. The records were then reviewed independently by two physicians with training in neurology (TK and GL).

The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was considered valid if record review revealed one or more of

Established diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the medical record or Parkinson's disease as cause of death on the death certificate
Current use of medication for Parkinson's disease such as dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) or a DOPA agonist
Neurological examination with physical findings consistent with parkinsonism (at least two of rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) with no evidence of a secondary cause of parkinsonism such as stroke, history of encephalitis, brain tumour, or neuroleptic treatment in the year before disease onset. Patients who developed dementia or severe dysautonomia within the first year of diagnosis were not considered valid cases of Parkinson's disease
Patient with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease who was followed by a neurologist or a movement disorders specialist.

Of the 73 patients with available medical records, the self reported diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was found to be valid in 90% (66 patients). In 7% it was not possible to exclude a secondary cause of parkinsonism, and in only 3% was the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease incorrect.

### Visual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^9b88ec85]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The contribution of non-motor symptoms to a reduced quality of life in Parkinson's disease is now widely recognized. In addition to complaints attributable to autonomic, gastrointestinal and cognitive dysfunction, visual symptoms are frequently reported. Although many groups have demonstrated changes in visual perception in Parkinson's disease, until now, most of these have focused on changes attributed to ophthalmic pathology. Here, we review the changes in visual perception in Parkinson's disease under four separate sections. First we examine the evidence for visual deficits from early sensory discrimination to higher visual dysfunction. Second, we consider the neurobiology underlying visual changes including location of deficits and associated genetic mutations. Third, we examine the link between visual dysfunction and other clinical manifestations such as visual hallucinations and consider current theories of visual hallucinations. Finally we consider the role for testing visual perceptual function in early detection of dementia in Parkinson's disease.

The scope of the problem of vision in Parkinson's disease

Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently report problems with visual tasks, such as navigating around everyday environments and using maps. In questionnaire studies, 78% of patients with Parkinson's disease report at least one visual symptom, including difficulty reading, sometimes with double vision, and misjudging objects and distances. Visual hallucinations are also common in Parkinson's disease, with a reported prevalence as high as 74% after 20 years of disease. The underlying mechanisms are still not well understood, despite multiple proposed mechanisms. A deeper understanding of changes in visual perception in Parkinson's disease will greatly enhance our ability to manage visual hallucinations. Visuo-perceptual problems are well described in dementia with Lewy bodies and in Parkinson's disease dementia, but there is growing evidence pointing to changes in visual processing earlier in the disease course. Here we examine changes in visual processing that are seen in patients with Parkinson's disease and no other cognitive deficits. The studies cited here involve patients in the mid-stages of Parkinson's disease at an average Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 while on their regular Parkinson's drugs, unless stated otherwise.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^00dcac0e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

Early Parkinson disease — hallucinations with dopaminergic therapy show that RD analyses from studies comparing levodopa with dopamine agonists (DAs) use a sign convention where a negative value indicates higher hallucination risk with DAs, and although DAs are more likely than levodopa to cause hallucinations at some time points, the difference between treatments for this outcome is small in early PD for the first 5 years of treatment.

Finally, methylone, the cathinone whose chemical structure most closely resembles that of MDMA, unsurprisingly also seems to possess the greatest pharmacological similarities to MDMA, albeit with some intriguing differences. Methylone was shown to lack dopamine neurotoxic effects in mice, but exacerbated these neurotoxic effects when co-administered together with MDMA. An in vivo study in adolescent rats found that high-dose repeated administration of methylone produced serotonergic impairment and memory deficits in rats but had little effect on mice. Adverse effects on 5-HT systems seem to be strongly dose-dependent however:found that rats treated with three consecutive doses of 3–10 mg/kg exhibited no long-term changes in brain monoamine levels, whereasandshowed that two consecutive doses of 10–30 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days (binge dosing) produced persistent brain 5-HT depletion even 2 weeks after administration of the final dose in rats.further showed that, despite their high-dose binge regimen of 4 × 30 mg/kg, the rats that had been treated with methylone did not perform worse than saline-treated rats in tests designed to assess memory and cognition.

Taken together, these results indicate that methylone likely does not produce any lasting negative effects on monoamine systems and cognition when administered in therapeutic applications, as the frequency of administration and the doses used in such contexts would fall well within the range employed by.

The effects of methylone on monoamine levels and transport have been studied in vitro as well as in live rats. Methylone displays an approximately equal ability to cross the blood–brain barrier as MDMA.

While the neurochemical effects of methylone clearly resemble those of MDMA in several respects, there is evidence to suggest that methylone nevertheless exerts its action via somewhat different mechanisms than the former drug.found that pretreatment with para -chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, fully inhibited the increased locomotor activity observed in rats after administration of MDMA, but did not have any effect on the increased motor activity observed after administration of methylone.

### Research priorities on the role of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis [^47985b4c]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

We propose that any framework for investigating the relationship between αSyn pathology formation and neurodegeneration should (1) critically consider multiple scenarios that capture the complex relationship between αSyn aggregation, pathology formation, and neurodegeneration; (2) include clear working definitions of the different types of αSyn species and consensus on outcome measures to assess neuron dysfunction and death; (3) account for differences in αSyn protein expression; (4) account for the diversity of αSyn aggregates/pathology observed in PD brains; (5) consider the possibility that not all αSyn aggregates are pathogenic (ie, some aggregates are toxic and/or seeding competent and others not); (6) acknowledge that differences in the kinetics of αSyn aggregate formation and clearance could be key determinants of the final fate of affected neurons; (7) consider the possibility that transient αSyn aggregation could trigger pathogenic pathway and cascading events that, once initiated, become independent of αSyn aggregation; and (8) accept that neurodegeneration could result from both aggregation‐dependent and aggregation‐independent mechanisms. It is important to develop preclinical models that recapitulate the different stages of αSyn aggregation formation and tools that enable specific detection of these pathologies. These resources would allow for testing established and new hypotheses and for dissecting the role of different αSyn species and the process of αSyn aggregation and LP formation in the development of PD and other αSyn‐related disorders.

### Alpha-synuclein oligomers: a new hope [^d3a7f4b7]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

A brief history of alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease

Over the past two decades, the pre-synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (a-syn) has been irrefutably tied to the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease. First, a genetic link was found to associate a-syn to Parkinson' disease; the point mutation in SNCA (A53T) was demonstrated to cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease and several other point mutations (A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D and A53E) have since been shown to cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Later, duplication or triplication of the a-syn locus was described in several Parkinson's disease and DLB families and in a handful of sporadic cases. A gene dosage effect of the synuclein gene (SNCA) has been suggested due to the observation that patients with a triplication have an earlier onset, more severe and faster progressing disease compared to those harbouring duplication of the SNCA locus.

An equally important milestone in the field was the identification of a-syn as a component of Lewy bodies in patients with both familial and sporadic forms of the disease, providing a direct link between different forms of the disease. Not only did this discovery draw attention to aggregated forms of a-syn as mediators of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, but also opened the door to the use of a-syn detection techniques for diagnosis and staging. Although this breakthrough occurred 20 years ago, research to date has not been able to describe the exact mechanism by which a-syn accumulates causes neuronal loss and leads to the development of the disease. Multiple lines of evidence now suggest that oligomeric species of a-syn, which are thought to precede the fibrillar aggregates found in Lewy bodies, are the culprits for neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will discuss the evidence supporting the toxicity of a-syn oligomers in Parkinson's disease and possible mechanisms for this toxicity, current methods for neuropathological analysis of a-syn oligomer deposition, recent findings indicating the prion-like spread of a-syn and possible therapeutic avenues targeting a-syn oligomers.

Discussion

All the different chemical classes discussed in this paper share many commonalities with MDMA, while also possessing some unique qualities of their own, which are sometimes superior to those of MDMA. The qualitative effects of all these substances can be described as entactogenic, with some having effects that are difficult to distinguish from those of MDMA, while others can vary in their potency or their stimulating or euphoric effects. Once again, it must be stressed that much of the information on the qualitative effects came from anecdotal reports and should therefore be treated with appropriate caution. While such reports can, to some extent, provide a phenomenological understanding of a compound's felt effects, the high degree of uncertainty in anecdotal reports means that they should always be followed up by structured, clinical investigations to unambiguously classify the compound's effects. In addition to their felt effects, the substances examined also show a wide range of neurotoxicity profiles, many of which are more favourable than that exhibited by MDMA. There is also a marked difference in the duration of the effects of the compounds treated here, which may be of use when careful tailoring of the duration of a therapeutic session is required.

SPECT using iodine-123–labeled dopamine transporter ligands — patient preparation and medication effects: It is recommended that just before the investigation, patients avoid taking any medication or drugs of abuse that could significantly affect visual and semiquantitative analysis of DAT binding, and clinicians should check for medications or drugs of abuse that alter tracer binding; whenever possible, patients should stop such medications for at least 5 half-lives. Cocaine, amphetamines, and methylphenidate are high-affinity DAT blockers that severely decrease tracer binding to DAT; modafinil at therapeutic doses significantly blocks dopamine transporter binding similarly to methylphenidate, and cannabinoids can affect DAT function. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase both [123I]β-CIT and [123I]FP-CIT striatal binding to DAT by 20% and 10%, respectively; overall, these effects, although small (especially for [123I]FP-CIT), should be considered in research studies but should not significantly affect interpretation of visual assessments in clinical routine application. Chronic lithium treatment might significantly reduce DAT binding.

### Fatal and non-fatal health incidents related to recreational ecstasy use [^6d1039a5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ecstasy-related fatal incidents

The UK is the only country where fatal ecstasy-related health incidents are systematically recorded in death registers by the UK coroner though, unfortunately, toxicological data on the substances detected post-mortem are not always cited on the death certificate. As the last-year prevalence of ecstasy use in the UK is also known, the risk of MRDs in the UK can be estimated.

Throughout the UK, the annual number of MRDs (1993–2016: 853; annual mean of 37) have increased steadily in recent years (2010: 8; 2016: 65). In England and Wales, the ONS reported in 2017 56 MRDs of which solely MDMA was implicated in 35 cases. Based on 550,000 last-year ecstasy users (general population, 16–59 years; prevalence: 1.7%), the number of 56 MRDs gives an estimate of 0.01% per year or one MRD per 10,000 ecstasy users. Based on two ecstasy sessions per year and one pill per session, the number of 56 MRDs gives an estimated risk of one MRD per 20,000 pills: risk per pill is 0.005%. MDMA was the only substance mentioned on the death certificate (no other drugs, but alcohol may also have been mentioned) in 35 MRDs so that the estimated risk of MDMA alone (per pill) is 0.003% (35/(2×550,000)) (Table 4). However, the latest GDS survey reported that the average ecstasy user in England had seven sessions per year with 1.7 pills per session, which would – assuming the same consumption rate in Wales as in England – reduce the risk per pill by a factor of six (11.9/2) to about 0.001% overall and 0.0005% per session with only ecstasy use.
