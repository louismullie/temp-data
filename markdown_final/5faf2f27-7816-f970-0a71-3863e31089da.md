A. in the predecision phase
B. when compliance is accompanied by a large reward
C. when compliance is accompanied by a small reward
D. when extreme polarization is present

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition leads to greater belief change in forced compliance situations according to cognitive dissonance theory, with options including the predecision phase, large versus small rewards, and extreme polarization. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism of cognitive dissonance and how forced compliance creates dissonance. Then, I should verify the role of external justification and the "insufficient justification" effect. Next, I will examine why large rewards reduce dissonance and small rewards amplify it. After that, I need to check whether the predecision phase or extreme polarization meaningfully alter this mechanism. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer, making sure I anchor the reasoning in classic dissonance findings and contemporary cognitive frameworks that extend them.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Cognitive dissonance arises when behavior conflicts with attitudes, creating psychological tension that people are motivated to reduce. In forced compliance, saying or doing something contrary to one's beliefs generates dissonance, and one way to reduce it is to change the belief to align with the behavior, especially when external justification is minimal.

> Wait, let me verify the role of justification. The magnitude of dissonance — and thus the likelihood of belief change — depends on the sufficiency of external justification. A large reward provides strong external justification ("I did it for the money"), which reduces dissonance and makes belief change less likely. Conversely, a small reward provides insufficient justification, leaving dissonance unresolved and increasing the chance that the person will change their belief to match their behavior, a classic "insufficient justification" effect.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about polarization. Extreme polarization reflects entrenched, group-anchored attitudes and often involves motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, which tend to stabilize beliefs rather than promote change. This is the opposite of the conditions that amplify dissonance-driven belief change, so polarization would not be expected to increase belief change in forced compliance paradigms [^8500cc0e] [^38778544].

> I should double-check the predecision phase. The predecision phase is about information search and attitude formation before a choice is made; forced compliance, by definition, occurs after a behavior has been enacted under pressure, so the predecision phase is not the relevant context for dissonance reduction via belief change following compliance.

> Let me synthesize. Greater belief change in forced compliance occurs when external justification is insufficient, which happens with a small reward. Large rewards suppress dissonance and belief change, whereas small rewards sustain dissonance and motivate attitude shift to restore consistency. Therefore, the correct choice is the option specifying a small reward [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. when compliance is accompanied by a small reward**. According to cognitive dissonance theory, when people are forced to comply with a request that conflicts with their beliefs, a **small reward** creates insufficient external justification, increasing internal pressure to reduce dissonance by changing their beliefs. In contrast, a **large reward** provides strong external justification, reducing the need for belief change. The predecision phase and extreme polarization are not central to this effect.

## Cognitive dissonance theory and forced compliance

Cognitive dissonance theory, proposed by Leon Festinger, posits that individuals experience psychological discomfort when their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors are inconsistent. To reduce this discomfort, individuals are motivated to change their beliefs or attitudes to align with their behaviors. Forced compliance occurs when individuals are compelled to behave in ways that conflict with their internal beliefs or attitudes, creating dissonance.

---

## The role of rewards in cognitive dissonance

Rewards play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of cognitive dissonance experienced in forced compliance situations. The **insufficient justification effect** states that when external justification for compliance is minimal (e.g. a small reward), individuals experience greater dissonance and are more likely to change their internal beliefs to align with their behavior. Conversely, when external justification is substantial (e.g. a large reward), individuals experience less dissonance and are less likely to change their beliefs.

---

## Experimental evidence supporting the insufficient justification effect

Classic studies by Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) and subsequent research have consistently demonstrated the insufficient justification effect. In these studies, participants were asked to perform a tedious task and then tell others it was enjoyable. Those who received a **small reward** for complying were more likely to genuinely change their attitudes toward the task, whereas those who received a **large reward** showed little attitude change. This pattern has been replicated across various contexts, reinforcing the robustness of the effect.

---

## Explanation of the insufficient justification effect

The insufficient justification effect can be explained by the following mechanisms:

- **Internal justification**: When external justification is minimal, individuals seek internal justification by changing their beliefs or attitudes to align with their behavior, thereby reducing dissonance.

- **Self-perception theory**: Individuals infer their attitudes from their behavior, especially when external incentives are minimal. This process leads to genuine attitude change.

- **Effort justification**: Greater effort or minimal external rewards increase the perceived value of the behavior, leading to attitude change.

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **Option A (predecision phase)**: The predecision phase involves anticipating dissonance and adjusting behavior accordingly. However, the question specifically addresses belief change in forced compliance situations, which occur post-decision.

- **Option B (large reward)**: A large reward provides sufficient external justification, reducing cognitive dissonance and the likelihood of belief change.

- **Option D (extreme polarization)**: Extreme polarization refers to the division of society into opposing groups with extreme views. While polarization can influence attitudes and behaviors, it is not directly related to the cognitive dissonance mechanism in forced compliance situations.

---

## Conclusion

In forced compliance situations, greater belief change occurs when compliance is accompanied by a **small reward**. This is because minimal external justification increases cognitive dissonance, motivating individuals to change their internal beliefs to align with their behavior. This phenomenon is a cornerstone of cognitive dissonance theory and has been extensively validated through empirical research.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^3737f4c6]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications of the proposed framework

This review has presented an integrative framework for the study of polarization based on the view of society as a complex system made up of individual agents driven by evolving beliefs, values, and norms within increasingly refined and narrow social identities. The purpose of this framework is to illuminate the unique role dissent plays in the process of polarization at different levels of society – a process that can culminate in extreme polarization and radicalization. The framework can be applied to contexts where extreme polarization has already occurred, is emerging, or where there is a high risk of it happening in the future.

Within this framework, polarization is seen as a dynamic process driven by social interaction and manifested as the transformation of society from an heterogenous state (in which everyone can interact with everyone else) to a highly ordered state that can culminate in a clustering of extreme beliefs, once a divisive issue is introduced. Within this framework, polarization is a process that can be observed at the level of a society, but reflects the transformation of the group and the individual within the group. That is, this transformation takes the form of an internalized social identity change that culminates in the increased susceptibility of conforming to extreme group norms, along a path to radicalization.

Our framework also clarifies the roles of dissent and consensus in the dynamics of polarization. Dissent is inherent wherever human interaction is present, as any aspect of social reality entails a degree of ambiguity or space for alternative interpretations, leading to ideological diversity. As people interact, communicate, and deliberate with either ingroup or outgroup members, nuanced views of the collective self in the group emerge, leading to a further differentiation of narratives, providing a clear basis for expressions of dissent. Thus, while consensus represents an ordering force that brings together those holding similar views, dissent is the force that fragments and pulls people apart. These two forces work concurrently, pulling groups and group members in opposing directions, and underpinning group dynamics resulting from factors such as influence, repulsion, and attraction, among others. Our framework highlights the importance of the interplay between dissent and consensus as the basis of both diverging narratives at the intergroup level, and diverging elements of a same, shared intragroup narrative.

### Macrophage polarization: tumor-associated macrophages as a paradigm for polarized M2 mononuclear phagocytes [^66ddd346]. Trends in Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that can express different functional programs in response to microenvironmental signals. Fully polarized M1 and M2 (or alternatively activated) macrophages are the extremes of a continuum of functional states. Macrophages that infiltrate tumor tissues are driven by tumor-derived and T cell-derived cytokines to acquire a polarized M2 phenotype. These functionally polarized cells, and similarly oriented or immature dendritic cells present in tumors, have a key role in subversion of adaptive immunity and in inflammatory circuits that promote tumor growth and progression.

### Polarization is the psychological foundation of collective engagement [^d6fc9c3a]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

We propose an alternative, perhaps more optimistic, view of polarization. While we accept that intergroup conflict and hostility are possible outcomes of polarization, these are not the only outcomes. There is a risk that, just as Le Bonput forward an influential yet flawed analysis of crowd behaviour in the late 19th Century, here too there has been inadequate recognition of the broader impacts of the social and psychological processes that allow polarization to emerge. Alongside an age of polarization, we are also living in an age of protest. As we argue, social psychological processes of polarization that have driven people to extreme forms of hostility and conflict have also been influential in producing mass movements to challenge the inequalities experienced by women, or people of colour, and overturning dictatorships. Far from diminishing humanity, these movements have elevated human rights and access. If one only studies the outcomes of polarization — such as revolution and social change on one hand, or intergroup hostility and conflict on the other, one only sees one part of the story, and not the psychological processes that are common to these disparate outcomes. Thus, one consequence of a broader contextualization of the origins and effects of polarization is a failure to recognize the important role that polarization plays in fostering political engagement, which is itself critical for pluralistic societies in general, and democracies in particular.

In this Perspective article, we bring together the above observations to build a more balanced view of the origins, nature, and effects of polarization. Our starting point is the observation that, in psychological science the term polarization has a long-standing meaning: the tendency for moderate attitudes to become more extreme after discussion. This effect was isolated in the laboratory by Moscovici and Zavalloni, who labelled it group polarization. It is illustrated in Fig. 1 a, b. Group polarization is easy to reproduce, both in the laboratory, and in everyday life. Moscovici and Zavalloni's experiments showed that Stoner'sidea of risky shiftwas a more specific case of the general tendency for groups to shift to a more extreme version of the initial tendency within the group. It's important to note at the outset that attitudinal extremity (attitudinal extremism) is not the same as support for violent extremism, although the two are often conflated, a point we return to below.

### Factual knowledge can reduce attitude polarization [^2563a976]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In contrast to the motivated reasoning claim, we argue it is far from obvious that factual knowledge causally increases attitude polarization. In fact, there seem to be good theoretical and empirical reasons to expect the opposite. Recent research suggests that human reasoning is "meaningfully directed toward the formation of accurate, rather than merely identity-confirming, beliefs" (ref.p. 2525) and that individuals act as Bayesian learners who incorporate new information into their evaluations of the political and social environment. Consistent with this view, a growing number of empirical studies have uncovered evidence that people update their political attitudes and beliefs in line with evidence (e.g. refs.–) and arguments, presented to them. Building on this line of work, we test the pre-registered hypothesis that learning facts about a contentious political issue has a causal depolarizing effect on political attitudes. We predict that when people are presented with a credible and politically diverse set of facts on an issue and are sufficiently incentivized to learn that content, they learn that there are valid considerations on both sides of the debate. This, in turn, results in the adoption of less extreme attitudes.

### Tumor-associated macrophages as a paradigm of macrophage plasticity, diversity, and polarization: lessons and open questions [^c1aaaf52]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Macrophages are present in all body compartments, including cancerous tissues, and their functions are profoundly affected by signals from the microenvironment under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Tumor-associated macrophages are a major cellular component of cancer-related inflammation and have served as a paradigm for the plasticity and functional polarization of mononuclear phagocytes. Tumor-associated macrophages can exert dual influence of cancer depending on the activation state, with classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) cells generally exerting antitumoral and protumoral functions, respectively. These are extremes in a continuum of polarization states in a universe of diversity. Tumor-associated macrophages affect virtually all aspects of tumor tissues, including stem cells, metabolism, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Progress has been made in defining signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic changes, and repertoire of microRNAs underlying macrophage polarization. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that macrophages may serve as tools for the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cancer and chronic nonresolving inflammatory diseases.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^b627e957]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

At the core of our framework is the dynamic interplay between individual and collective processes within a divided society, when there is dissent over a contentious issue. Dissent is defined here as disagreement on a position on an issue which is sufficiently important to provide a basis for social identity formation. Polarization is seen as a complex process driven by incremental changes in attitudes and beliefs in the individual, that are amplified through social influence and emergent group dynamics. We propose that this process is not only initiated by dissent in a society, but it is also sustained by it. In other words, dissent is both the catalyst of polarization, as an initial difference in position possibly leading to the formation of oppositional identities, and its driver, sustaining and accelerating polarization in a society over time (as difference in position leads to further differentiation in all aspects of identity content, including beliefs, values, and norms, etc.).

We adopt a conceptualization of polarization as a process of increasing the ideological and psychological distance between groups underpinned by specific social identity content. This conceptualization integrates aspects of both issue-driven polarization (where the distancing is driven by ideological dissent that may cross partisan boundaries) and affective polarization (where distancing is driven by animosity and hostility between opposing sides). These interconnected ideological and affective aspects manifest as forces pulling groups apart. Differences in ideological position become the driver of the process of sorting the public into opposing sides along the lines of conflicting multiple social identities; a process further enhanced by difference, distrust, and disdain for the opposing group. Taking this view, polarization arises as a gradual extremization of the ingroup position and increased distancing from ideological outgroups. As the ingroup position becomes more extreme, the group becomes more ideologically segregated.

### Polarization is the psychological foundation of collective engagement [^04066b9c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The term polarization is used to describe both the division of a society into opposing groups (political polarization), and a social psychological phenomenon (group polarization) whereby people adopt more extreme positions after discussion. We explain how group polarization underpins the political polarization phenomenon: Social interaction, for example through social media, enables groups to form in such a way that their beliefs about what should be done to change the world — and how this differs from the stance of other groups — become integrated as aspects of a new, shared social identity. This provides a basis for mobilization to collective action.

### Respondents with more extreme views show moderation of opinions in multi-year surveys in the USA and the Netherlands [^47c1e4fb]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, the present findings raise the question of when and why societies will tend towards moderation or extremism. Our research was not designed to answer this question, but we can make a few comments. Recent evidence on polarization has focused mainly on affective polarization, namely dislike among political adversaries. However, empirical studies that examined different types of polarization over time showed that not all types of polarization increased in the past decades.

Moreover, public interest in disputed socio-political issues ebb and flow over long periods of time. The process of identifying and ultimately resolving issues of conflict can explain how current extreme attitude holders become more moderate over time while new extremists pop up with respect to newly identified issues. Moreover, as new generations join society new crops of potential extremists and moderates enter into the political debate. It is possible that new entrants into the political discourse are more likely to be extreme than people who have been interested and informed about politics for many years. This would suggest that while (some of) the people who used to be extreme tend to moderate over time, new entrants can nevertheless create polarization.

Limitations

This work is not without limitations. What we find differs from previous studies, which measured attitude change over periods of weeksGiven that the time horizon appears to matter, it would be especially helpful to measure attitudes over even longer time periods, such as decades in order to understand the long-run evolution of extreme and moderate attitude holders.

Second, many socio-political issues experience fluctuation sin the level of the interest they evoke among partisans in different time periods. Our study does not explicitly account for this or for the reasons why some issues become more or less central. It would be very helpful to understand how the general interest in an issue affects the evolution of extreme attitudes related to it.

Third, our studies focus on Western samples, namely from the Netherlands and the United States. Due to various cultural and political differences, it would be very helpful to understand samples from Eastern cultures as well.

Fourth, our research provides evidence for effects but does not provide evidence for psychological mechanisms underlying these effects. More than mechanism can explain effects such as these, which occur over long periods of time and across very different socio-political issues. Although we raise ideas for these mechanisms, future research can test them.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^c56c6bf1]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rise of social media, increased online interaction, and greater access to information, as well as misinformation, have all contributed to societies becoming more polarized. Problematic online encounters between both like-minded people and those with opposing views have been shown to result in the reinforcement of extreme views and intensification of belief polarization, reducing the willingness of groups to engage in constructive dialog –. In extreme cases, this can lead to radicalization, where individuals or groups adopt extreme views that sanction political violence –. An illustration of this process is the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, which can be traced back to the formation of "Stop the Steal" Facebook group, in the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Quickly attracting over 300,000 members, the group amplified unfounded election fraud claims. Within this group, dissenting views were excluded and member polarization increased, creating ideal conditions for the emergence of a divisive narrative, further inflamed by misinformation and conspiracy beliefs, and ultimately leading to radicalization and political violence. This example also highlights the very real danger of polarization for democratic societies, and the importance of understanding the socio-psychological processes that underpin it, so that more effective evidence-based strategies to counter polarization are developed.

Despite the need for empirically grounded approaches to counteract polarization, the potential impact of existing research in this domain is reduced by insufficient crossover between the academic disciplines investigating this phenomenon. To address this limitation, we conducted an extensive review of research from social and political psychology, as well as the disciplinary domains under the umbrella of computational social science. By bringing together perspectives from these diverse disciplines to the study of polarization, we develop a conceptual framework of polarization as a layered, complex process that can ultimately lead to radicalization. To identify the mechanisms underpinning polarization from moderate levels to its most extreme forms, we draw on social psychological theories of group dynamics. We propose that the study of these processes is enriched by integrating approaches from computational social science, which enable a more refined empirical analysis of the (micro-level) interactions between individuals that underpin these dynamics, as well as the macro-level social structures that result. The advances in our current understanding of polarization resulting from this integration would help establish a more robust foundation for policy recommendations aimed at mitigating the causes of societal polarization and potential radicalization of individuals.

### Respondents with more extreme views show moderation of opinions in multi-year surveys in the USA and the Netherlands [^3baee15a]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Polarization is thought to weaken democratic systems and lead to intolerance –. It is therefore important to understand how extreme attitude holders and moderates evolve over time. Do extreme attitude holders tend to be set in their ways or can they moderate over time? Here we measure the time course of extremism as expressed through policy attitudes. In this context, we find that extremists have more volatile attitudes compared to moderates and that change tends to occur towards the middle.

Contributions

These findings represent several contributions. First, they might help us better understand polarization. Existing research often views polarization from the lens of deteriorating attitudes towards outgroups (i.e. affective polarization). To be clear, we do not measure attitudes towards outgroups, but rather attitudes about socio-political issues. It is possible that attitudes towards outgroup are polarizing while attitudes towards specific issues are moderating.

Moreover, the evidence on affective polarization describes the evolution of groups, whereas the present analyses track the evolution of individuals. Research on attitudes towards outgroups uses pooled cross-sectional data (i.e. measuring different people over multi-year periods), finding that the people of the current generation dislike outgroups more than people of previous generations. To make inferences about specific individuals' attitudes towards outgroup, a longitudinal analysis as we do here with respect to policy attitudes will be necessary. This will help shed light on whether antipathy towards outgroups is increasing or moderating over the average person's lifespan. It is entirely possible for outgroup attitudes to be polarizing at the group level but moderating at the individual level.

### Respondents with more extreme views show moderation of opinions in multi-year surveys in the USA and the Netherlands [^3dc71670]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

The comparison with the findings on affective polarization also raises intriguing conceptual questions. Specifically, it raises the interesting possibility that changes in policy attitudes over time do not necessarily depend on the degree to which people feel antipathy towards adversaries. In other words, a person can become more moderate in matters of policy while also vehemently dislike members of the opposing party. Or, even more interestingly, a person might become more extreme in policy issues while maintaining respect towards those who disagree.

Second, a potential divergence in the trajectories of extremism in policy issues and extremism in attitudes towards outgroups may suggest that these two facets of polarization can be driven by different psychological processes. Attitudes towards policies are explained through moral values. In contrast, attitudes towards outgroups (and ingroups) are explained through social identity theory — the sense of belonging to a social group and the motivation to bolster one's own group and derogate a competing group –. More broadly, the picture of polarization is enriched by contrasting its expression in policy attitudes versus outgroup attitudes.

Third, the present research raises future directions related to understanding why extremists tend to moderate over time, at least in policy attitudes. As we note, one type of explanation might relate to persuadability: People are indeed known to forcefully resist opinions they disagree with, but this resistance is not without bounds and understanding the extent and channels with which contrarian information can lead to attitude change will be important. Another type of explanation revolves around the idea of personality maturation in developmental psychology wherein individuals are assumed to become more agreeable as they age (and hence more receptive to others' arguments and potentially less extreme in their opinions). Finally, a focus on the between-individual heterogeneity in the reasons why people become extremists in the first place might be fruitful in explaining moderation over time. Potentially, extreme attitudes may be driven both by reasons more compatible with transience (such as idiosyncratic life events or social signaling,) and with resistance to change (such as moralization of policy attitudes).

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^144475d7]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceived societal polarization

Participants rated the extent to which they think Israel is polarized, without mentioning the reform. Higher scores indicated higher perceived polarization.

Motivated perceptions

We assessed two perceptions that can be motivated by participants' views on the reform — false consensus and importance of democratic features. To assess false consensus, we looked at participants' perceptions of the distribution of opinions about the reform in the population. Participants indicated the percentage of the population that supports, opposes, and has no opinion about the reform (adding up to 100). False consensus manifests when participants estimate their own camp (either pro- or anti-reform) as larger than the other camps. To assess importance of democratic features, we presented participants with six features — majority rule, separation of power between branches of government, protection of minority rights, independent and free media, free elections, and protection of human rights for everyone equally. Participants rated the extent to which they believe each feature is important to Israel's democracy.

Motivated downstream consequences

Participants rated their opinions regarding downstream consequences that can be motivated by the extremity of their views on the reform (i.e. issue-based polarization) and their feeling towards opposing camps (i.e. affective polarization). Following Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI for full description), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization: endorsement of extreme protest methods (e.g. civil revolt), support of extreme protest control (e.g. police violence), conflict management strategies (e.g. compromise, dialogue), and delegitimization of political opponents. Delegitimization was assessed in the context of the judicial reform. Participants rated characteristics of people who support the reform and of people who oppose it (e.g. "They do not understand what democracy is", "They want revenge"). As with affective polarization, for each participant, we used only the items reflecting delegitimization of the opposing camp. Higher scores indicated greater delegitimization.

### Motivated scientific reasoning biases, epistemological beliefs, and theory polarization: a two-process approach to adolescent cognition [^dae5bdeb]. Child Development (2000). Low credibility.

Theory-motivated reasoning biases arise when different reasoning skills are invoked to evaluate evidence that is congruent or incongruent with individuals' belief systems. To explore this phenomenon, 66 early and 73 middle adolescents evaluated evidence relevant to their theories of social class or religion. In both conditions, reasoning biases were found, but in-group biases were evident only in the religion condition. In both conditions, higher order scientific reasoning was used to reject theory-incongruent evidence and judgmental heuristics (i.e., cognitive rules of thumb) were used to evaluate theory-congruent evidence. In both conditions, subsequent to the evidence presentation, adolescents' theories became more extreme (i.e., polarized) than at the outset of the experiment. Beliefs regarding the origin, acquisition, and certainty of knowledge, however, appeared to moderate reasoning biases and theory polarization. Age differences emerged on only one index of bias: In the religion condition, middle adolescents were more likely to treat theory-incongruent evidence as implausible. These findings are pertinent to theories of cognitive development, decision making, rationality, and in-group favoritism.

### Factual knowledge can reduce attitude polarization [^f7563414]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The main goal of this study was to experimentally test predictions derived from the theory of politically motivated reasoning (PMR). Under the PMR account, people incorporate pro-attitudinal information into their belief systems and reject counter-attitudinal information, which, in turn, makes them more polarized (e.g. ref.). To test whether this indeed is the case, we have utilized a novel experimental design that exogenously varies domain-specific factual knowledge and examines its independent causal effect on attitude polarization. We find that learning issue-relevant facts causes people to adopt more moderate policy attitudes, without changing their feelings towards people with opposing views. Exposure to facts about gun control results in attitudes that are closer to the other side of the policy debate, and this effect occurs for those who are predisposed to support gun control as well as those who are predisposed to oppose it. The depolarizing effect of domain-specific knowledge is found for different indicators of attitude, and it is still visible one month after the treatment.

Our results inform ongoing debates about the impact of motivated reasoning on political cognition. Specifically, the findings presented here challenge a common claim in the PMR literature, namely, that acquiring domain-specific knowledge results in the adoption of more extreme attitudes. In contrast to this claim, we find that, given a modest incentive, individuals are willing to learn all types of facts, including a substantial amount of counter-attitudinal content. More importantly, this increased factual knowledge leads people to adopt less extreme attitudes. The latter result is especially telling because, while we incentivized people to learn the facts presented to them, we did not incentivize them to adopt more moderate attitudes.

In line with previous work suggesting people can be motivated to accurately update their political beliefs (e.g. refs.,), we find that upon learning relevant facts about both sides of an issue, participants adopt, on average, less extreme political attitudes. Individuals in our study used facts not to bolster their prior beliefs, but to revise them. This finding can have important political consequences: while the motivated reasoning account implies that educating people about contentious issues will simply polarize them along political lines, we demonstrate that closing the knowledge gap between the two sides of the gun control debate can result in attitude moderation. Our study thus suggests that if citizens who disagree on policy had the same factual knowledge, their attitudes may converge.

### M2 macrophages in kidney disease: biology, therapies, and perspectives [^dc64cd26]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Tissue macrophages are crucial players in homeostasis, inflammation, and immunity. They are characterized by heterogeneity and plasticity, due to which they display a continuum of phenotypes with M1/M2 presenting 2 extremes of this continuum. M2 macrophages are usually termed in the literature as anti-inflammatory and wound healing. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the biology of M2 macrophages and their potential for clinical translation. In this review we discuss the current state of knowledge in M2 macrophage research with an emphasis on kidney disease. We explore their therapeutic potential and the challenges in using them as cellular therapies. Some new regulators that shape macrophage polarization and potential areas for future research are also examined.

Downstream consequences

We fitted linear models controlling for demographic characteristics as in previous analyses. Following an Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization. The results are presented in Table 4. As we already reported effects of cluster on downstream consequences when answering Q2 above, we do not reiterate them here.

Table 4
Predicting downstream consequences of polarization: Protest methods, protest control, conflict management strategies, and delegitimization of political opponents

Note. The analyses included N = 488 complete observations. Significant main effects are bolded unless the interaction term is significant. Significant simple slopes are bloded if the interaction is significant.

Protest methods

Perceived polarization was associated with greater endorsement of extreme protest methods across clusters. Issue-based polarization interacted with cluster. Supporting the notion that endorsement of extreme protest methods might reflect motivated reasoning, among anti-reform participants (whose camp consistently protested the reform), the more extreme their views were, the more they endorsed protest methods. For pro-reform participants, the more extreme their views were, the less they endorsed protest methods.

Protest control

Issue-based and affective polarization interacted with cluster. Supporting the notion that endorsement of extreme protest control might be motivated, for anti-reform participants, the more extreme their views on the reform were, the less they endorsed protest control. For pro-reform participants, the more extreme their views were and the more negatively they felt about the anti-reform camp, the more they endorsed protest control.

Conflict management strategies

Issue-based and affective polarization were associated with less favorable views of conflict management strategies across clusters. Interactions with cluster were not significant.

Delegitimization of political opponents

Issue-based and affective polarization were associated with greater delegitimization. Perceived societal polarization interacted with cluster. For the anti-reform cluster, the more participants perceived society as polarized, the more they delegitimized their political opponents.

### Direct observation of prompt pre-thermal laser ion sheath acceleration [^fbe25e8a]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Directed electron generation by the v×B force

The given interpretation of both experiments further relies on the assumption that laser energy is converted into hot electrons in a directed way, as introduced in Fig. 2a. Such behaviour can be expected in the presence of a small scale length preplasma for relativistic laser intensities, where the v × B force dominates, and consistent behaviour was observed in earlier experiments detecting Cerenkov or coherent transition radiation at the target rear side. The v × B dominated absorption mechanism further implies that the performance of the proton acceleration process is mostly independent of the angle of incidence of the laser beam on the foil and of the orientation of its linear polarization. Such dependencies have however been reported at lower intensities and extreme pulse contrast where the Brunel heating mechanism is dominant. Relative maximum proton energies are presented in Fig. 4 for different angles of incidence as a function of the effective target thickness d eff (d eff = d foil for δ = 0° andfor δ = 45°) for the present interaction conditions. The decrease in intensity byfor the case of δ = 45° has been taken into account by the proper choice of the laser energy for the normalization shots. In conclusion, the target thickness scan reveals no dependence on the angle of incidence, which compares well with recent results. Independently, the laser polarization was varied with a thin half-wave plate close to the focussing optics (Fig. 1). Apart from a slight enhancement of about 10% for p -polarization with respect to s -polarization under oblique incidence, no dependence of the proton acceleration on laser polarization orientation was observed. Both findings support the v × B dominated laser light conversion into directed electrons.

### Experimental determination of giant polarization in wurtzite III-nitride semiconductors [^0d100c3b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Refined polarization understanding in III-nitride heterostructures

The above findings contribute to a refined understanding of polarization in GaN-based heterostructures, where strain induced piezoelectric polarization should also be considered. WZ III-nitrides are typically hetero-grown on substrates along the polar c -axis. Consequently, an in-plane biaxial strain (, where, withandbeing the in-plane lattice constants for the relaxed and strained layers, respectively) is present in the top layer, leading to a strain induced piezoelectric polarization.is defined as the formal polarization difference between the strained and relaxed structure. It can be expressed in terms of the in-plane biaxial strain, piezoelectric coefficients, and elastic constants. See details in Supplementary Note 1.

We use a state-of-the-art M-polar AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure as an example to assess the spontaneous, piezoelectric, total polarization, as well as the interface polarization difference. Calculation details are discussed in Supplementary Note 3. To quantitively compare the difference arising from the divergent reference structures, we set the Al composition to 0.3 (Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 N), a commonly used barrier in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The biaxial strain effect in Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 N is evaluated by considering two extreme cases: fully relaxed and fully strained one. The left panel of Fig. 4a(i-iii) presents the polarization schematic in M-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures derived using the LH reference, exhibiting a significant difference compared to the conventional understanding based on the ZB reference, as shown in Fig. 4a(iv-vi).

### Determining the polarization state of an extreme ultraviolet free-electron laser beam using atomic circular dichroism [^2f9bf1c3]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Ultrafast extreme ultraviolet and X-ray free-electron lasers are set to revolutionize many domains such as bio-photonics and materials science, in a manner similar to optical lasers over the past two decades. Although their number will grow steadily over the coming decade, their complete characterization remains an elusive goal. This represents a significant barrier to their wider adoption and hence to the full realization of their potential in modern photon sciences. Although a great deal of progress has been made on temporal characterization and wavefront measurements at ultrahigh extreme ultraviolet and X-ray intensities, only few, if any progress on accurately measuring other key parameters such as the state of polarization has emerged. Here we show that by combining ultra-short extreme ultraviolet free electron laser pulses from FERMI with near-infrared laser pulses, we can accurately measure the polarization state of a free electron laser beam in an elegant, non-invasive and straightforward manner using circular dichroism.

### Asymmetric developmental bifurcations in polarized environments: a new class of human variants, which may include autism [^17077ff6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the context of evolutionary theory, living organisms typically exhibit relatively stable phenotypes during hundreds of years despite constant, but minor, variations across multiple traits. Large evolutionary changes occur over longer periods through the alignment or misalignment of these variations with unpredictable environmental changes. On the time scale of a single individual's life, several states of alternating equilibrium can compete with the dominant state of the individual. Some of them belong to the heritage of the species (anger, anxiety) but become pathological and psychiatric when extreme. However, a unique form of alignment between variations of living organisms and their environment occurs when a species simultaneously presents two stable, sometime lifelong alternative possibilities, each resulting in largely distinct phenotypical states coexisting within the same species, albeit at an asymmetric prevalence. In animals, situations have thus been identified where a continuously distributed genetic liability produces two contrasting adult morphological, physiological, or behavioural phenotypes, stably but asymmetrically represented within the species. This is the case, for instance, of the coexistence of long-winged and flightless forms of certain female locusts. The orientation toward one or the other of these alternative states satisfies randomly distributed genetic factors evolving in a constrained environmental system.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^566caa77]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ideologically opposed camp formation

Camps are groups based on shared narratives about social reality. Conflict occurs due to alternative interpretations of important aspects of that reality. These narratives are often aligned with opposing or mutually exclusive world views, moral values, and political orientation. For example, conflicting narratives include those based on dissent about interpretations of history in intractable conflicts –. While conflicting narratives may divide societies into opposed camps, consensus within these camps, that is, self-identification with like-minded people, forms the basis of identity maintenance and development. This means that, within each opposing camp, the group narrative shapes the content of the collective identity with its associated values, beliefs, and norms.

From the perspective of group members, the strength of social identification reflects the importance of the group to the individual. If we apply this argument to opposed camps, the strength of identification should be reflected in the degree of ideological certainty about the group narrative. That is, certainty about the group-defining narrative representing the truth from the perspective of the group. Of course, other sources of social identity strength are available to group members, including leadership, power struggles, and social cleavages. For members of ideologically opposed camps, however, the interactions between ingroup and outgroup members, by which group-defining narratives are validated or invalidated via discussions, are likely to affect the group members' levels of certainty. This creates the need for group members exposed to the outgroup's position to seek further validation from the ingroup. Conversely, it is likely that members of camps would seek to avoid exposure to narratives and arguments contradicting their own. For example, both committed liberals and conservatives prefer to stay in their own ideological bubble rather than be confronted with conflicting narratives on contentious social issues. It follows that intragroup interactions are likely to become preferential as members of ideologically opposed camps would actively seek validation and re-endorsement of the ingroup narrative (confirmation bias) and avoid challenges from outgroups. Thus, while group members would be attracted by interactions with ingroup members, they would be ideologically "repulsed" when interacting with outgroup members. This pattern of preferential interaction can lead to ideological segregation through exclusive communication with others who have the same point of view, as in "… liberals watching and reading only liberals; moderates, moderates; conservatives, conservatives; Neo-Nazi, Neo-Nazi"(p.9), which can drive the further transformation of society, through further polarization between ideologically opposed camps. Within a camp where consensus is expected, interactions between group members validate and reinforce the camp identity, so that a process of mutual influence towards the crystallization of identity may occur.

### Giant polarization ripple in transverse pyroelectricity [^350ce8a7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The pyroelectric effect which generates electricity via spontaneous polarization change under temporal temperature fluctuations, is a promising approach to scavenge the underexplored diffused heat of unstable, non-static thermodynamic processes. The pyroelectricity is typically given byandfrom the electric dipole moment change per unit volume of polar materials –. Hereis the pyroelectric coefficient, andare intrinsic spontaneous polarization (mainly contributed by the primary pyroelectricity) and electrical polarization with respect to applied thermal and electric fields, respectively. Though theof pyroelectric materials has almost been pushed to the upper limit, it is still a long way from being practically deployed for waste/solar heat harvesting on account of the low energy conversion efficiency.

Recently, electric-field-free pyroelectrics have presented an increase in generated power density from 10 to 10³ μW m⁻² for low-grade solar heat harvesting via out-of-plane heat variation –. However, these conventional (CONV) devices harness solar heat homogenously, limited by simultaneous heat conversion and transfer/dissipation along the longitudinal direction –. This spatially coupled thermodynamic process results in small heat gradients (Δ T), non-static temperature changes (d T /d t), and thermal disequilibrium durations (d t). Thereby not only the temperature-dependent(i.e. surface charge density from dipole moment change) was restricted, but also the pyroelectric voltage (V(t) ∝ p and ΔT) and current (I(t) ∝ p and dT/dt). Consequently, traditional pyroelectrics are unfeasible for intermittent low-grade solar heat harvest, aiming to achieve high electricity output based on inconsiderable or unstructured ambient energy input. Although many efforts have been devoted to boosting pyroelectricity, e.g. polarization change via applied electric field –, modulating thermodynamic cycles, tailoring material properties, or hybridization with other effects/mechanisms –, the harvesting of the prevalent non-static heat is making little headway due to the additional energy penalty or device complexity and instability. Fortunately, controllable transverse heat localization and/or redistribution has been proven promising in photothermal interfacial heating and nonlinear light-modulated solar vaporization; – there are a few, if any, studies on efficient pyroelectricity via heat transfer manipulation.

### The polarized mind in context: interdisciplinary approaches to the psychology of political polarization [^2a591916]. The American Psychologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Existing research into the psychological roots of political polarization centers around two main approaches: one studying cognitive traits that predict susceptibility to holding polarized beliefs and one studying contextual influences that spread and reinforce polarized attitudes. Although both accounts have made valuable progress, political polarization is neither a purely cognitive trait nor a contextual issue. We argue that a new approach aiming to uncover interactions between cognition and context will be fruitful for understanding how polarization arises. Furthermore, recent developments in neuroimaging methods can overcome long-standing issues of measurement and ecological validity to critically help identify in which psychological processing steps-e.g., attention, semantic understanding, emotion-polarization takes hold. This interdisciplinary research agenda can thereby provide new avenues for interventions against the political polarization that plagues democracies around the world.

### Dynamics of polarization-tuned mirror symmetry breaking in a rotationally symmetric system [^53736093]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To understand intuitively the extraordinary MSB mechanism and LOF, we consider a specific system with SO (2) continuous rotational symmetry that could be easily implemented by experiment. The system is schematically shown in Fig. 2a. Here, an isotropic dielectric spherical particle with the highest symmetry is semi-floating at the interface of two mediums, half part of the particle in medium 1 (air, refractive index n 1) and the other half in medium 2 (water, refractive index n 2). An LP plane wave (λ = 532 nm) with a polarization angle α illuminates obliquely on the particle from the air at an incident angle θ. Such a strategy of utilizing the buoyancy at the interface is widely used in applications such as chiral enantiomeric sorting, medical diagnostics and analytical chemistry.

### Full polarization and high coherence control of thermal emissions via saddle-band dispersion engineering [^db4f94a0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We calculated and demonstrated the relationship between the emission spectra for different chiral polarization states and the output angle in the y -direction, exemplified for δ = 280 nm in Fig. 3c, d, where the color amplitude signifies the emissivity. The simulated results confirm that the device not only exhibits a large dependence of the emission wavelength on the output angle with respect to the y- direction, but also exclusively emits LCP light over a wide range of output angles, maintaining a stable Q-factor of over 1100 throughout the range. Our further simulation results also indicate that these characteristics exhibit good robustness against manufacturing imperfections (see Supplementary Fig. 15). We also extended the simulation to a broader spectral and angular range (see Supplementary Fig. 7), revealing the emergence of low-ECD modes at longer wavelengths. These unwanted modes can be suppressed using narrowband filters for practical applications. Notably, the ECD remains above 0.8 within the central ± 10° range, where polarization purity is most distinguishable. Therefore, we focus on the spectral range of 5.15–5.4 μm and the angular span of ± 10°, where the chiral emission features are well preserved. The electric field distribution portrayed in Fig. 3e underscores that an enhanced electric field is present for LCP output, dominated by magnetic dipoles (see Supplementary Fig. 6), while it is decoupled from the RCP output. To quantitatively characterize the spatial coherence of the device along y, which is implied by the steep dispersion for LCP in Fig. 3d, we calculated the spatial angular distribution of the LCP output frequency around 0 and 5°, and the relevant results are presented in Fig. 3f. For an output wavelength of 5.3 μm, which corresponds to normal output, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of its angular distribution Δ θ is merely 0.96°, indicating that the spatial coherence length of the device's spin output in the normal direction is: L_c = λ/Δθ ≈ 60λ ≈ 0.32 mm» P_y. This results significantly surpasses the near-zero spatial coherence length achieved by traditional metallic metasurface-based circularly polarized thermal emission, and nearly three times of the latest results based on all-dielectric localized geometric phase-controlled thermal radiation. Moreover, for a shorter output wavelength of 5.234 μm, L c is found to be 1.37 mm. Significantly, thermal emissions across multiple polarization states at different δ values show nearly unchanged results of the spatial coherence (see Supplementary Figs. 9 and 12). Further results indicate (see Supplementary Fig. 13) that if low-loss single-crystal materials are employed in conjunction with low-contrast corrugation depth, the device's normal emission output Q-factor can reach above 65,000, and L c can reach the "cm" scale (L_c = 2046λ = 1.078 cm). For the device's tilted output around 5°, it can even achieve a coherence length of L_c up to 10.63 cm. These features are pivotal for future integrated light sources and high-efficiency thermal emission.

### Evidence of depolarization and ellipticity of high harmonics driven by ultrashort bichromatic circularly polarized fields [^104b159f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

High harmonics generated by counter-rotating laser fields at the fundamental and second harmonic frequencies have raised important interest as a table-top source of circularly polarized ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet light. However, this emission has not yet been fully characterized: in particular it was assumed to be fully polarized, leading to an uncertainty on the effective harmonic ellipticity. Here we show, through simulations, that ultrashort driving fields and ultrafast medium ionization lead to a breaking of the dynamical symmetry of the interaction, and consequently to deviations from perfectly circular and fully polarized harmonics, already at the single-atom level. We perform the complete experimental characterization of the polarization state of high harmonics generated along that scheme, giving direct access to the ellipticity absolute value and sign, as well as the degree of polarization of individual harmonic orders. This study allows defining optimal generation conditions of fully circularly polarized harmonics for advanced studies of ultrafast dichroisms.

Answers:
A. Colloid milium – Incorrect. Colloid milium mimics nodular amyloidosis but differs in Van Gieson staining (yellow) and clinical presentation with small, dome-shaped papules on sun-exposed areas. Both can be positive for Congo red and colloid milium can show mild focal apple green birefringence on polarization. Colloid milium electron microscopy shows short, branching, wavy filaments and remains the gold standard for differentiation.
B. Hyaluronic acid filler reaction – Incorrect. Reactions to hyaluronic acid filler commonly affect the lips and perioral area, presenting as cystic granulomas, occurring weeks to years after treatment. Histology shows basophilic material surrounded by multinucleated giant cells.
C. Lipoid proteinosis (LP) – Incorrect. LP results in the deposition of hyaline material in the skin, brain, and organs.LP presents with a hoarse cry in infancy, vesicles, and pitted scars. Later lesions include characteristic beaded papules on the eyelids (moniliform blepharosis) and verrucous papules and plaques on extensor extremities. In contrast to nodular amyloidosis, LP is periodic acid-Schiff positive, diastase resistant, and Congo red is negative or weakly positive.
D. Nodular amyloidosis – Correct. Nodular amyloidosis involves light chain immunoglobulin light chain deposition, seen as pink, waxy nodules clinically. Nodular amyloidosis stains positive for Congo red, thioflavin T, and methyl violet and appears as nonbranching filaments under an electron microscope. Polarization of Congo red staining shows apple-green birefringence. Van Gieson staining of nodular amyloid is red in contrast to the yellow seen in colloid milium. Plasma cells are normally present and demonstrate light chain restriction, in contrast to systemic amyloidosis.
E. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with a wide range of dermatologic manifestations, including subcutaneous nodules which tend to be firm, mobile, and found on the extremities. Histopathology shows non-caseating granulomas.

### Nanoscale polarization transient gratings [^8f81f140]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Light manipulation at the nanoscale is essential both for fundamental science and modern technology. The quest to shorter lengthscales, however, requires the use of light wavelengths beyond the visible. In particular, in the extreme ultraviolet regime these manipulation capabilities are hampered by the lack of efficient optics, especially for polarization control. Here, we present a method to create periodic, polarization modulations at the nanoscale using a tailored configuration of the FERMI free electron laser and demonstrate its capabilities by comparing the dynamics induced by this polarization transient grating with those driven by a conventional intensity grating on a thin ferrimagnetic alloy. While the intensity grating signal is dominated by the thermoelastic response, the polarization grating excitation minimizes it, uncovering helicity-dependent responses previously undetected. We anticipate nanoscale polarization transient gratings to become useful for the study of physical, chemical and biological systems possessing chiral symmetry.

### Giant polarization ripple in transverse pyroelectricity [^6440af30]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

The conceptual mechanistic of pyroelectrics under uniform solar heating is schematically presented in Fig. 1. The heat flux and fluctuation of a conventional device (Fig. 1a) typically propagate and dissipate in the out-of-plane direction, i.e. the z -direction along with the device thickness, and the irradiation area equals the device area (A), stemming a constant magnification (denoted as the conventional scenario, M = 1). Contrarily, the proposed transverse pyroelectric generator (Fig. 1b) harvests the solar heat in a confined area (TPG, M > 1), inducing atypical non-uniform heat delivery from the hotspot to the non-irradiation area. This spatially decoupled heat localization and propagation engender fluctuated heat variation and polarization ripple along the transverse direction (i.e. x–y plane) to the non-irradiated peripheral part (Fig. 1b), which also prolongs the temperature variation time in the pyroelectric system. Moreover, according to pyroelectric fundamentals, the local intense heat variation (dT/dt) creates a giant polarization ripple (i.e. Δ P S or larger dipole moment shift, θ), attributed to higher electrostatic induced surface charge density (σ). Despite having the irradiation area reduced, our TPG outperforms the conventional device and contributes to an unprecedented output enhancement (Fig. 1c) under identical illuminations and magnifications. This is ascribed to the augmented non-uniform transverse polarization ripple and prolonged heat propagation duration. In addition, the cooling process shares a similar thermal propagating phenomenon with the heating process while there is no consistent heat input to the system, which, likewise, results in higher pyroelectricity than the traditional counterpart. The unconventional transverse heat confinement provides the basis of triggering travelling thermal packages valid for heating/cooling processes which hold enormous potential for advancing energy efficiency and autonomy in system operation.

### Expression profiling of cerebrospinal fluid identifies dysregulated antiviral mechanisms in multiple sclerosis [^569c0bb3]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

As well as changes in T cells we also identified two disease-relevant MOFA factors in the macrophage population, one related to anti-inflammatory M2 polarization and the other related to antigen presentation. Macrophages have been shown to be of importance in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis — experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis — human multiple sclerosis pathology, disease progression, remyelinationand in the neuro-inflammation present in many degenerative neurological diseases. Our MOFA data indicate that in multiple sclerosis there is reduced polarization towards the M2 phenotype and increased expression of the machinery of antigen presentation, likely indicating that the MOFA has identified factors indicative of an altered phenotypic cell state in multiple sclerosis.

Given the extreme functional plasticity of immune cells in response to environmental stimuli, it is difficult to disentangle whether the phenotypes we have captured represent the cause or the consequence of disease. However, our single cell analysis has identified genes and pathways critical in both adaptive and innate immune cells, emphasizing the importance of both arms of the immune system in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, our finding that the multiple sclerosis susceptibility variants rs10271373 and rs1059091 are eQTLs for antiviral genes in CSF CD8+ T cells supports the hypothesis that dysregulation in viral control mechanisms is involved in the development of multiple sclerosis.

### Cognitive-motivational mechanisms of political polarization in social-communicative contexts [^8500cc0e]. Nature Reviews Psychology (2022). High credibility.

Healthy democratic polities feature competing visions of a good society but also require some level of cooperation and institutional trust. Democracy is at risk when citizens become so polarized that an 'us versus them' mentality dominates. Despite a vast multidisciplinary literature, no coherent conceptual framework of the microlevel dynamics that increase or decrease polarization has been presented. In this Review, we provide a conceptual framework to integrate scientific knowledge about cognitive-motivational mechanisms that influence political polarization and the social-communicative contexts in which they are enacted. Ego-justifying and group-justifying motives lead individuals to defend their own pre-existing beliefs and those of their in-group, respectively. However, a distinct class of system-justifying motives contributes to asymmetric forms of polarization. Whereas conservative-rightist ideology is associated with valuing tradition, social order and maintenance of the status quo, liberal-leftist ideology is associated with a push for egalitarian social change. These cognitive-motivational mechanisms interact with social influence processes linked to communication source, message and channel factors, all of which might contribute to increased or decreased polarization. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions and ways in which our framework can be extended to the study of culture and institutions.

### Polarization nano-tomography of tightly focused light landscapes by self-assembled monolayers [^e249bfe8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Differentiating non-paraxial from paraxial fields

Within the nano-tomographic approach, the observed asymmetry in fluorescence including its intensity (amplitude) and phase distribution mirrors the non-paraxial properties of investigated focal 4D light field. In contrast to non-paraxial fields, paraxial ones only embed negligible longitudinal electric field contributions. As the asymmetric shape is caused by the contribution of longitudinal polarization components, this characteristic shape is not observed in the paraxial regime. Hence, the symmetry of fluorescence represent a fundamental means to differentiate between paraxial and non-paraxial light fields. This can be easily demonstrated by the numerical analysis of fluorescence in the case of applying paraxial fields for the monolayer excitation. For this purpose, we chose the far field distribution of introduced tailored vectorial beams (σ₁₂ = ±8,) to be radiated onto a SAM of random orientation d(x, y), d_z > 0. The far field distribution is determined according to(: Fourier transform, E in: paraxial input field; see Methods, Eq. (3)). Based on Eq. (1) with, considering, we calculate the respective normalized fluorescence rate distributions, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, Fig. 4a or b belongs to the exciting light field with σ₁₂ = 8 (flower) or σ₁₂ = −8 (spider web). Note that, for comparison reasons, we adapted the spatial resolution of shown fluorescence distributions according to the experimental system applied later on (see Methods). Obviously, there are only slight differences visible between results in Fig. 4a, b, even if applied light fields look significantly different in polarization (Fig. 1c, d). Consequently, one cannot distinctly differentiate between a flower or spider web structure by monolayer fluorescence detection. Moreover, all structures are symmetrically distributed (point symmetric), as there is no influence of longitudinal polarization components. In contrast, we expect unique asymmetric fluorescence distributions dependent on σ 12 andto be observed in the case of non-paraxial light fields effected by characteristiccontributions.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^b34be10d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Optical phase singularities are zeros of a scalar light field. The most systematically studied class of singular fields is vortices: beams with helical wavefronts and a linear (1D) singularity along the optical axis. Beyond these common and stable 1D topologies, we show that a broader family of zero-dimensional (point) and two-dimensional (sheet) singularities can be engineered. We realize sheet singularities by maximizing the field phase gradient at the desired positions. These sheets, owning to their precise alignment requirements, would otherwise only be observed in rare scenarios with high symmetry. Furthermore, by applying an analogous procedure to the full vectorial electric field, we can engineer paraxial transverse polarization singularity sheets. As validation, we experimentally realize phase and polarization singularity sheets with heart-shaped cross-sections using metasurfaces. Singularity engineering of the dark enables new degrees of freedom for light-matter interaction and can inspire similar field topologies beyond optics, from electron beams to acoustics.

### Doublet asymmetry for estimating polarization in hyperpolarizedC-pyruvate studies [^93df777a]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperpolarized 13 C MRS allows in vivo interrogation of key metabolic pathways, with pyruvate (Pyr) the substrate of choice for current clinical studies. Knowledge of the liquid-state polarization is needed for full quantitation, and asymmetry of the C 2 doublet, arising from 1% naturally abundant [1,2–13 C]Pyr in any hyperpolarized [1–13 C]Pyr sample, has been suggested as a direct measure of in vivo C 1 polarization via the use of an in vitro calibration curve. Here we show that different polarization levels can yield the same C 2 -doublet asymmetry, thus limiting the utility of this metric for quantitation. Furthermore, although the time evolution of doublet asymmetry is poorly modeled using the expected dominant relaxation mechanisms of carbon-proton dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy, the inclusion of a C-C dipolar coupling term can explain the observed initial evolution of the C 2 doublet asymmetry beyond its expected thermal equilibrium value.

### Monitoring macrophage polarization in infectious disease, lesson from SARS-CoV-2 infection [^8559c434]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID-19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID-19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high-throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID-19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID-19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID-19.

### Evidence of depolarization and ellipticity of high harmonics driven by ultrashort bichromatic circularly polarized fields [^ee09656e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The above sources of temporal asymmetry result in a spectral broadening of each harmonic peak with spectrally-varying polarization properties. Ultrafast dichroism measurements involve the polarization characteristics of the short harmonic temporal pulses, that is, the ones calculated over the spectrally-integrated harmonic peaks. The temporal/spectral variations of the polarization may result in a significant amount of depolarization.

A first temporal asymmetry, introduced by the fast variation of the driving fields on the pulse edges, results in a modification of the quantum trajectories leading to the harmonic emission. The recollision time, direction and probability that respectively influence the phase, polarization and intensity of the attosecond emission deviate rapidly (within a ω cycle) from the constant-envelope case (by dt, dα, and dI, respectively in Fig. 1b). These variations decrease the ellipticity and polarization degree of the harmonic peaks, as evidenced by TDSE calculations in helium at intensities low enough to avoid significant (< 2%) depletion of the medium due to ionization (Fig. 1). The harmonic spectra (Fig. 1d) show well-defined peaks at low orders due to the short electron trajectories (travel time shorter than 0.5 T) giving the dominant contributions to the harmonic emission. However, the peaks broaden considerably with increasing order leading to an overlap of neighboring orders above H32 and a mixing of their polarization properties. This broadening is a direct consequence of the inter-cycle temporal modulation of the harmonic dipole phase in the laser envelope –. The resulting harmonic chirp – leads to a blue-shift of the central frequency on the rising edge and a red-shift on the falling edge, as evidenced by a Gabor time-frequency analysis of the harmonic intensity (Fig. 1c) and ellipticity (Fig. 1e). For the plateau harmonics (H19-31), the Gabor spectrograms reveal a roughly constant central frequency but an ellipticity almost opposite on the pulse edges as compared to the central part, due to the fast intra-cycle variations illustrated in Fig. 1b. Consequently, the harmonic ellipticity corresponding to the emission during the whole pulse is significantly reduced for all orders to 0.5–0.8, and the depolarization reaches 5 to 10%, and up to 20% for high orders (Fig. 1f). Note that these short-pulse envelope effects depend on the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) and are still significant for 10-cycle FWHM driving fields (Supplementary Note 4).

### Tailored compliant mechanisms for reconfigurable electromagnetic devices [^08f3e414]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

These types of antennas have been extensively studied and have shown similar performance to simulations with high radiation efficiency and realized gains on the order of 7.5 dB that can be realized. Moreover, for top-loaded monopole antennas a maximum radiation angle of around 25–30 degrees is achieved –. These properties are all consistent with the presented reconfigurable CMA.

Table 1 presents a comparison of notable reconfigurable origami antennas with the rCMA introduced here. Due to the vast reconfiguration parameter space for antenna characteristics, Table 1 is limited to mainly a comparison to frequency reconfiguration of origami-based antennas. Also included is a single example of polarization reconfiguration. It is believed that due to the extreme versatility of the presented compliant mechanism method, polarization reconfiguration can be easily incorporated into a new antenna design or even the currently presented devices.

3.2 Overview of Analytic Workflow

In Figure 2, we present a high‐level overview of all the steps in the multivariate extreme value framework we propose. In brief, we first estimated a normative model for all the IDPs using age, sex, and site as our covariates. We then applied a warped Bayesian Linear Regression (wBLR) model, which helped us to predict the neuroimaging data from the covariates whilst modeling non‐Gaussianity and providing us with posterior predictive intervals for each prediction. This essentially follows an approach we have validated previously (Rutherford, Fraza, et al; Fraza et al.). We then evaluated the performance of the wBLR model and the likelihood warping by examining multiple error metrics, namely explained variance, mean standardized log loss (MSLL), kurtosis, and skewness (see the supplement for details). Then, we collected the deviation or z ‐scores for each participant and all the IDPs into one z ‐scores matrix, including all the IDPs we modeled. Next, we transformed the marginals and converted them to polar coordinates, which are standard operations in extreme value statistics and will be explained in more detail below. Then, we thresholded the data at the 95‐quantile in polar coordinates. Finally, the TPDM was calculated, based on the extreme quantiles of the data. On this matrix, we performed an eigenvalue decomposition, which gave us an eigenbasis that explains most of the extremal structure in the first few eigenvectors. Finally, we correlated the first few extreme PCs back to behavior to establish a brain‐behavior relationship. These steps are explained in more detail in the next sections.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^352c3afb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered phase-singularity sheet

As a proof-of-concept for singularity sheet engineering, we design a 2D phase-singularity sheet with a heart-shaped cross-section (Fig. 3). The heart-shaped singularity is centered at z = 10 mm and is designed for the scalar field associated with the x -polarized electric field at λ₀ = 532 nm emitted from a 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm patterned aperture. The paraxial scalar field approximation (qualitatively supported by the propagation distance to the target plane being much larger than the aperture size) is justified by a full vectorial propagationof the electromagnetic fields, which shows that the time-averaged energy density associated with the y (transverse) and z (axial) polarization components over the volume of interest is much smaller (in this case, < 0.05%) than that of the x -polarization. The sheet singularity is constructed by maximizing the phase gradient in the directions oriented normally to a heart-shape at the target z = 10 mm plane. The free parameters are the propagation phase delay (from 0 to 2 π) at each pixel on the patterned aperture located at z = 0 mm. The optimized phase pattern is shown in Fig. 3b and does not exhibit any discernible long-scale pattern apart from a series of concentric rings, which appear to apply a focusing effect. Figure 3a shows a field intensity isosurface of the singularity profile to depict its orientation in 3D space (real and imaginary zero-isosurfaces are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 3), along with the locations and directions at which the phase gradient maximization was performed. This surface represents the points at which the phase gradient is very large, nearly reaching 100 times the wavenumber k₀. Simulated cross-sectional intensity and phase plots at the z = 10 mm plane are depicted in Fig. 3d, g, respectively. There is a visible phase jump of π radians across the singularity boundary as the field changes sign. The phase profile is in fact continuously differentiable with a well-defined phase gradient and just achieves a large gradient value at the singularity boundary. In Fig. 3c, we plot this phase gradient magnitude |∇⊥ϕ|² = (∂xϕ)² + (∂yϕ)² profile alongside the intensity and phase profiles for the linear cut indicated in Fig. 3d. These profiles are qualitatively similar to those of a transverse cut through the singular optical axis of a fundamental LG₀,₁ vortex beam of the same wavelength (with a beam waist diameter equal to the diagonal of the 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm square aperture), which are plotted using dotted lines in Fig. 3c. The transverse phase gradient over the transverse plane is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 4. This phase gradient achieves large magnitudes near the heart-shaped boundary and even exceeds k₀ by an order of magnitude, thereby exhibiting superoscillatory behavior. The longitudinal behavior of this cut profile with z is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5, which shows that |∇⊥ϕ| exceeds k₀ for a superoscillatory region ~150 μm in front of and behind the target z = 10 mm plane. The characteristic depth of this singularity sheet using this superoscillatory region is thus around 300 μm. The depth of a singularity sheet can be extended by maximizing the phase gradient over more than one transverse plane. We also exhibit additional phase-singularity sheet shapes (flat sheet and double-walled cylinders) in Supplementary Fig. 6 to demonstrate the versatility of this algorithm.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^555d0017]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered polarization singularity sheet

The process for engineering 2D phase-singularity sheets is also directly applicable to engineering 2D polarization singularity sheets. A detailed review of the connection between phase and polarization singularities is provided by Ruchi et al. Polarization singularities can take multiple forms, but here we focus on C -point singularities in which the polarization azimuth Ψ (in a paraxial field, with negligible E z contribution) is singular. Ψ is the angle that the major axis of the polarization ellipse makes with the transverse x -direction (Supplementary Fig. 10). Together with the ellipticity angle θ, which determines the eccentricity and handedness of the ellipse, the pair (Ψ, θ) parameterizes the space of fully polarized light. To deploy phase gradient maximization, we need to identify a complex scalar field σ such that arg(σ) ∝ Ψ. This complex field will exhibit the same geometries in Fig. 1. Maximizing the phase gradient of σ then maximizes the azimuth gradient and produces polarization singularities. One such field is σ = |Eₓ|² − |Eᵧ|² + 2i·Re(EₓEᵧ*) for which arg(σ) = 2Ψ. This can be written as σ = s₁ + is₂ using the Stokes polarization parameters, which comprise four experimentally measurable intensities that parametrize the full space of polarized (and partially polarized) light. They are defined in Eqs. (4)–(7) using the left-handed convention.where Iⱼ refers to the intensity of the polarization component projected in the j direction. For fully polarized light, s₀² = s₁² + s₂² + s₃², which allows all polarization states to be assigned a unique point on a sphere in (s₁, s₂, s₃) space — the Poincaré sphere (Supplementary Fig. 10). Lines of constant Ψ are longitudes on the sphere. Just as globe longitudes intersect at the poles so that the longitudinal coordinate is undefined there, Ψ is singular at the Poincaré sphere poles at which circularly polarized light resides. There, s 1 and s 2 go to zero, in analogy to the vanishing of the real and imaginary parts of a scalar complex field at a phase singularity. It is noteworthy, however, that the overall field intensity at the polarization singularity can be non-zero, because s 3 may not vanish.

### Magnetic hyperbolic optical metamaterials [^b66fe818]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Strongly anisotropic media where the principal components of electric permittivity or magnetic permeability tensors have opposite signs are termed as hyperbolic media. Such media support propagating electromagnetic waves with extremely large wave vectors exhibiting unique optical properties. However, in all artificial and natural optical materials studied to date, the hyperbolic dispersion originates solely from the electric response. This restricts material functionality to one polarization of light and inhibits free-space impedance matching. Such restrictions can be overcome in media having components of opposite signs for both electric and magnetic tensors. Here we present the experimental demonstration of the magnetic hyperbolic dispersion in three-dimensional metamaterials. We measure metamaterial isofrequency contours and reveal the topological phase transition between the elliptic and hyperbolic dispersion. In the hyperbolic regime, we demonstrate the strong enhancement of thermal emission, which becomes directional, coherent and polarized. Our findings show the possibilities for realizing efficient impedance-matched hyperbolic media for unpolarized light.

### Giant polarization ripple in transverse pyroelectricity [^7f9b8da7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Pyroelectricity originates from spontaneous polarization variation, promising in omnipresent non-static thermodynamic energy harvesting. Particularly, changing spontaneous polarization via out-of-plane uniform heat perturbations has been shown in solar pyroelectrics. However, these approaches present unequivocal inefficiency due to spatially coupled low temperature change and duration along the longitudinal direction. Here we demonstrate unconventional giant polarization ripples in transverse pyroelectrics, without increasing the total energy input, into electricity with an efficiency of 5-fold of conventional longitudinal counterparts. The non-uniform graded temperature variation arises from decoupled heat localization and propagation, leading to anomalous in-plane heat perturbation (29-fold) and enhanced thermal disequilibrium effects. This in turn triggers an augmented polarization ripple, fundamentally enabling unprecedented electricity generation performance. Notably, the device generates a power density of 38 mW m⁻² at 1 sun illumination, which is competitive with solar thermoelectrics and ferrophotovoltaics. Our findings provide a viable paradigm, not only for universal practical pyroelectric heat harvesting but for flexible manipulation of transverse heat transfer towards sustainable energy harvesting and management.

### Like-minded sources on facebook are prevalent but not polarizing [^a0d0e9ef]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Many critics raise concerns about the prevalence of 'echo chambers' on social media and their potential role in increasing political polarization. However, the lack of available data and the challenges of conducting large-scale field experiments have made it difficult to assess the scope of the problem 1,2. Here we present data from 2020 for the entire population of active adult Facebook users in the USA showing that content from 'like-minded' sources constitutes the majority of what people see on the platform, although political information and news represent only a small fraction of these exposures. To evaluate a potential response to concerns about the effects of echo chambers, we conducted a multi-wave field experiment on Facebook among 23,377 users for whom we reduced exposure to content from like-minded sources during the 2020 US presidential election by about one-third. We found that the intervention increased their exposure to content from cross-cutting sources and decreased exposure to uncivil language, but had no measurable effects on eight preregistered attitudinal measures such as affective polarization, ideological extremity, candidate evaluations and belief in false claims. These precisely estimated results suggest that although exposure to content from like-minded sources on social media is common, reducing its prevalence during the 2020 US presidential election did not correspondingly reduce polarization in beliefs or attitudes.

### Polarization-controlled directional scattering for nanoscopic position sensing [^e4566c13]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Controlling the propagation and coupling of light to sub-wavelength antennas is a crucial prerequisite for many nanoscale optical devices. Recently, the main focus of attention has been directed towards high-refractive-index materials such as silicon as an integral part of the antenna design. This development is motivated by the rich spectral properties of individual high-refractive-index nanoparticles. Here we take advantage of the interference of their magnetic and electric resonances to achieve strong lateral directionality. For controlled excitation of a spherical silicon nanoantenna, we use tightly focused radially polarized light. The resultant directional emission depends on the antenna's position relative to the focus. This approach finds application as a novel position sensing technique, which might be implemented in modern nanometrology and super-resolution microscopy set-ups. We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept experiment that a lateral resolution in the Ångström regime can be achieved.

### Polarization-selective unidirectional and bidirectional diffractive neural networks for information security and sharing [^e421453b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Experimental demonstration of the unidirectional-bidirectional DNN digit classifier.

a, b Schematic of the working principle of the unidirectional-bidirectional DNN under x - and y -polarized THz illumination from the forward (a) and backward (b) directions. c – e Digit patterns and corresponding measured electric-field intensity distributions in the output plane under the forward incidence of x - and y -polarized THz waves. f – h Digit patterns and corresponding measured electric-field intensity distributions in the output plane under the backward incidence of x - and y -polarized THz waves. i – l Measured output-energy distribution maps for the x -polarized forward incidence. m Measured confusion matrix for the x -polarized forward incidence.

In addition to polarization-selective directional digit recognition, this approach can be extended to unidirectional and bidirectional imaging, yielding a polarization-controllable imager with unidirectional-bidirectional capabilities. For example, under forward illumination of x -polarized THz waves and an input digit "2", the measured diffractive field distributions in the output plane form a y -polarized image of "2", as shown in Fig. 3 a, b. Here, the input diffractive field (after the pattern of "2") is processed by the hidden layer, which rotates the polarization and reconstructs the image in the detection plane. However, no image of "2" is observed for the incidence of x -polarized THz waves from the backward direction (Fig. 3 d, e). When the input digit switches to "3", "6", or "7", x -polarized forward incidence generates images of these digits in the output plane (Fig. 3 a, b), while no corresponding images appear under backward incidence (Fig. 3 d, e). In comparison with Fig. 3 b, e, a unidirectional imager can be achieved by our PS-DNN under the illumination of x -polarized THz waves from the forward direction. By switching the incident polarization to y -polarization, both forward and backward incidences can produce reconstructed images of "2", "3", "6" and "7" (Fig. 3 c, f), demonstrating the bidirectional imaging capability under y -polarized excitation. Thus, merely altering the incident polarization allows the cascaded metasurface to function as either a unidirectional or bidirectional imager, supporting applications in information security (one-way transmission) and information sharing (two-way transmission). Further numerical demonstrations of the polarization-selective unidirectional–bidirectional imager can be found in Supplementary Note 10.

### Spherical neutron polarimetry under high pressure for a multiferroic delafossite ferrite [^237aca17]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The analysis of three-dimensional neutron spin polarization vectors, using a technique referred to as spherical neutron polarimetry (SNP), is a very powerful means of determining complex magnetic structures in magnetic materials. However, the requirement to maintain neutrons in a highly polarized state has made it difficult to use this technique in conjunction with extreme experimental conditions. We have developed a high pressure cell made completely of nonmagnetic materials and having no effect on neutron polarizations. Herein, we report the first SNP analyses under high pressure up to 4.0GPa in the magnetoelectric multiferroic delafossite CuFeO 2. This study also determined the complex spiral magnetic structures in these pressure-induced phases, by measuring the full neutron polarization matrix. The results presented herein demonstrate that the SNP measurements are feasible under high pressure conditions, and that this method is a useful approach to study pressure-induced physical phenomena.

### Confidence drives a neural confirmation bias [^38778544]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A prominent source of polarised and entrenched beliefs is confirmation bias, where evidence against one's position is selectively disregarded. This effect is most starkly evident when opposing parties are highly confident in their decisions. Here we combine human magnetoencephalography (MEG) with behavioural and neural modelling to identify alterations in post-decisional processing that contribute to the phenomenon of confirmation bias. We show that holding high confidence in a decision leads to a striking modulation of post-decision neural processing, such that integration of confirmatory evidence is amplified while disconfirmatory evidence processing is abolished. We conclude that confidence shapes a selective neural gating for choice-consistent information, reducing the likelihood of changes of mind on the basis of new information. A central role for confidence in shaping the fidelity of evidence accumulation indicates that metacognitive interventions may help ameliorate this pervasive cognitive bias.

### Spontaneous electric-polarization topology in confined ferroelectric nematics [^577499aa]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Observation of polarization meron variants

In N F droplets, the texture (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4) cannot be brought into an extinction status under the crossed polarizers, especially in the center. Similar polarized light microscopy (PLM) images were also found recently in some other N F systems. These observations suggest the N F droplets carry a spontaneous twist along the depth direction, which causes the optical rotation effects. This was immediately confirmed in detail by PLM decrossing technique. The clockwise (Fig. 3a) or counter-clockwise (Fig. 3c) rotation of the analyzer distinguishes two different types of textures: at specific decrossing conditions, one type turns to a dark state (i.e. extinction) and the other remains bright. This indicates the two types have opposite handedness. With the insertion of a quarter-wave plate, it seems that the two types of patterns correspond to concentric director fields with left hand (Fig. 3d, e) and right hand (Fig. 3f, g) spirals. To obtain 3D orientational information, we employ the fluorescence confocal polarizing microscopy (FCPM) and deduce the director field, ("Methods"). In principle, the polarizing fluorescence process gives rise to aorientational dependence of the fluorescence signal, whereis the angle between the incident linear polarization and local director. Also, the out-of-plane of director tilting causes the decrease of fluorescence. Thus, analyzing the spatial distribution of fluorescence intensity at proper combination of polarization conditions allows us to calculate the director field ("Methods"). Technically, while the linear polarization pumping makes the in-plane and out-of-plane director tilting undifferentiable, the addition of experiment with a circular polarized pumping light at the same field-of-view extracts the pure information of the out-of-plane tilting. Therefore, the in-plane and out-of-plane director tilting information are uncoupled and accessible. Worth noting, it is exclusively possible to know the average molecular orientation, but the polarization information is still missing. Figure 3h–k demonstrates the FCPM images of the two types of patterns. It confirms that the N F droplets confined in the thin LC cells show cylindrical shape with some curvatures. From the 2D cross sections at various depths (Supplementary Fig. 5), it is seen that, consistent with the PLM observation, two types of director fields spontaneously twist like spirals. The 3D orientational information for deriving the overall topology can be further deduced by calculating the 3D distribution of director orientation. As seen from the FCPM under a circular polarized pumping light, a decrease of fluorescence occurs near the droplet center, while the other areas show a constant fluorescence intensity (Supplementary Fig. 6c). In the depth cross section profile, the fluorescence profile in the droplet center appears as a broaden black cylinder along the surface normal. This suggests the director field exhibits either a significant out-of-plane tilting towards the center (i.e. homeotropic-like in the center) or a disclination line. The possibility of the existence of a line disclination is excluded by experiment. The fluorescence profile of a designed line disclination by photo-pattern is thin and sharp (Supplementary Fig. 6a), which disagrees with the broaden black cylinder in the fluorescence profile of droplets (Supplementary Fig. 6b). This suggests that the broad range of light extinction corresponds to the out-of-plane tilting of director. Therefore, the observed topology is limited to either a meron-like structure or an escaped vortex structure as further discussed later in "Discussion". Additional simulations of the fluorescence profile of these two possible structures deduced from numerical structural relaxation ("Methods", Discussion and Supplementary Figs. 7a–c) further confirm the topology of the droplet. It is clear that the signal profile of meron-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 7b) is consistent with our experimental result (Supplementary Fig. 7d), suggesting the observed topology is meron-like structures (Fig. 3l, m) if such a polarization field exists in addition to the orientational field.

### Radial bound States in the continuum for polarization-invariant nanophotonics [^99d32511]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

All-dielectric nanophotonics underpinned by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have demonstrated breakthrough applications in nanoscale light manipulation, frequency conversion and optical sensing. Leading BIC implementations range from isolated nanoantennas with localized electromagnetic fields to symmetry-protected metasurfaces with controllable resonance quality (Q) factors. However, they either require structured light illumination with complex beam-shaping optics or large, fabrication-intense arrays of polarization-sensitive unit cells, hindering tailored nanophotonic applications and on-chip integration. Here, we introduce radial quasi-bound states in the continuum (radial BICs) as a new class of radially distributed electromagnetic modes controlled by structural asymmetry in a ring of dielectric rod pair resonators. The radial BIC platform provides polarization-invariant and tunable high-Q resonances with strongly enhanced near fields in an ultracompact footprint as low as 2 µm 2. We demonstrate radial BIC realizations in the visible for sensitive biomolecular detection and enhanced second-harmonic generation from monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, opening new perspectives for compact, spectrally selective, and polarization-invariant metadevices for multi-functional light-matter coupling, multiplexed sensing, and high-density on-chip photonics.

### Polarizing-specific white lines in a clear cell acanthoma [^fff8540c]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Histologic diagnosis

The epidermis had a well-demarcated area of acanthosis with keratinocytes showing clear cytoplasm.

Key message

Clear cell acanthoma is a relatively rare, slow-growing, benign, epidermal tumor first described by Degos et alin 1962. The tumor typically presents as a solitary, papular-nodular lesion or erythematous plaque, predominantly on the lower extremities of both men and women aged 50 years or older. The adaptation of polarized dermatoscopy has allowed the field of dermatology to identify new visual features, such as polarizing-specific white lines, also known as shiny white lines, which are postulated to occur because of collagen alteration or fibrosis. Metaphorically, they have been referred to as crystalline structures/lines or chrysalis structures. Polarizing-specific white lines are most commonly described in dermatofibromas, scars, basal cell carcinomas, Spitz nevi, and melanomas. They are also observed in some cases of lichen planus-like keratosis, and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Crystalline structures have been briefly mentioned in the setting of clear cell acanthomaand curved white lines have been reported in 1 case of giant clear cell acanthoma, but to our knowledge, they have never been described as occurring in lines in parallel with the array of vessels. We suspect these white lines represent the streaking fibrosis observed around vessels in the papillary dermis of clear cell acanthoma (Fig 3). Herein, we present an otherwise classic clear cell acanthoma with the finding of polarizing-specific curved lines arranged in parallel to the arrays of vessels.

### Measurement of complex optical susceptibility for individual carbon nanotubes by elliptically polarized light excitation [^39fc503a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We first apply this technique to individual suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes in a transmission geometry. Experimental scheme of our elliptical-polarization-based optical homodyne detection method is shown in Fig. 1a. A supercontinuum laser was used as the light source to provide a broadband excitation (450–900 nm), a pair of confocal polarization-maintaining objectives served to focus the supercontinuum light on individual nanotubes and collected the transmitting and nanotube-scattering lights, two polarizers and a quarter-wave plate were used to generate elliptically polarized light and control the polarization of transmitted light. Here we should note that the very careful selection of objectives and wave plate to maintain the polarization purity is crucial to realize the final signal detection (See optical component details in Methods). Layouts of the polarization control are shown in Fig. 1b, c. The two polarizers were set strictly perpendicular to each other, and the suspended nanotube was positioned at an angle of π/4 with respect to two polarizers. In the two different configurations, fast axis of the quarter-wave plate was kept at a small angle (θ) with polarizer 1 (Fig. 1b) or polarizer 2 (Fig. 1c) to generate left-handed (E L) or right-handed (E R) elliptical-polarization light as the excitation for the nanotube. Due to the very strong 1D depolarization effect, the nanotube-scattering field is mainly polarized along the nanotube axial direction. Therefore, the nanotube forward-scattering field can be written asand, respectively, where β represents a scattering coefficient. Before polarizer 2, the forward-scattering light of the nanotube interferes with the transmitted optical reference beam (Fig. 1d, e), which yields the optical contrast signal aswhere T i is the transmission signal intensity, Δ T i is the change of transmission signal intensity resulted from the presence of a nanotube, and i stands for L or R (Theterm has been neglected because it is orders of magnitude smaller than the cross term). After polarizer 2, the reference light field is decreased dramatically due to small eccentricity of elliptically polarized light, while the nanotube's scattering field is only decreased by a small proportion. Therefore, the optical contrast is greatly enhanced, typically by 20 times in our transmission geometry. More importantly, the variation of the modulated signals depends on the real part of the cross term, and this term varies with the elliptical chirality of incident light (Fig 1f, g). In detail, detected optical contrast signals caused by left- or right-handed incident light can be written as:

### Polarizability matters in enantio-selection [^66f47b0d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The prevalence of chirality, or, handedness in biological world is a fundamental phenomenon and a characteristic hallmark of life. Thus, understanding the origin of enantio-selection, i.e., the sense and magnitude of asymmetric induction, has been a long-pursued goal in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we demonstrated a polarizability-derived electronic effect that was shown to be capable of rationalizing a broad range of stereochemical observations made in the field of asymmetric catalysis. This effect provided a consistent enantio-control model for the prediction of major enantiomers formed in a ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenations of ketones. Direct and quantitative linear free energy relationships between substrates' local polarizabilities and observed enantio-selectivity were also revealed in three widely known asymmetric catalytic systems covering both reductions and oxidations. This broadly applicable polarizability-based electronic effect, in conjunction with conventional wisdom mainly leveraging on steric effect considerations, should aid rational design of enantio-selective processes for better production of chiral substances.

### Investigating the role of group-based morality in extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice [^4f8c63e6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To test for moderated mediation, we first investigate whether binding values moderate the mediation effects of binding and individualizing values violations. Specifically, to test whether binding values moderate the mediating effect of perceived moral wrongness, we estimate the Average Causal Mediation Effects (ACME) for perceived moral wrongness with binding values fixed at high (1 SD above the mean) and low (1 SD below the mean) values. Under this design, evidence of moderated mediation is constituted by an increase in the ACME when binding values are high compared with the ACME when binding values are low. As such, we treat binding values as a treatment susceptibility factor that influences the degree to which participants respond to the experimental manipulation of binding values.

Using an analytic strategy similar to those employed in the previous studies, we estimated two Bayesian regression models in order to test for moderated mediation in the domain of binding values violations. Our results were strongly consistent with the hypothesis of moderated mediation (See Fig. 6). For simplicity, for this analysis and the following analyses, we report the moderated mediation effects for the probability of indicating acts of hate are at least slightly justified, marginalized across the type of hate act (See Supplementary Information for tables reporting full moderated mediation effects). Specifically, there was no evidence for a substantive Average Direct Effect (ADE) of experimental manipulation for participants with low binding values (ADE l o w) or high binding values (ADE h i g h), ADE l o w = 0.01, posterior SD = 0.02, 95% CI = [−0.0003, 0.031], ADE h i g h = 0.02, Posterior SD = 0.04, 95% CI = [−0.007, 0.10]. Further, for participants with low binding values, there was also no evidence for a substantive ACME, ACME l o w = 0.01, posterior SD = 0.01, 95% CI = [0.0007, 0.026]. However, for participants with high binding values, there was strong evidence for a large ACME, ACME h i g h, 0.53, posterior SD = 0.21, 95% CI = [0.13, 0.87].

### Enigma: infection or allergy? Vancomycin-induced DRESS syndrome with dialysis-dependent renal failure and cardiac arrest [^fe95815e]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A man aged 73 years with infective endocarditis presented with septic shock and was started on immediate antimicrobial therapy. His blood culture yielded no organism. Subsequently, he developed a severe allergic reaction to prolonged empirical vancomycin therapy. This manifested as fever, widespread maculopapular rash and severe progressive acute kidney injury ultimately requiring dialysis. In the context of eosinophilia, this was determined to be drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Deciphering this complication as allergy in the context of severe infection required extreme caution due to the polarity of treatment with immunosuppression. Ultimately, this was used, with improvement of renal function, resolution of symptoms and absence of recurrence of infection. In summary, we present a case of vancomycin-related DRESS syndrome leading to dialysis-which is unique in the literature-complicating the treatment of culture-negative infective endocarditis.

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Metacognition biases information seeking in assessing ambiguous news [^07c7d7b8]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

How do we assess the veracity of ambiguous news, and does metacognition guide our decisions to seek further information? In a controlled experiment, participants evaluated the veracity of ambiguous news and decided whether to seek extra information. Confidence in their veracity judgments did not predict accuracy, showing limited metacognitive ability when facing ambiguous news. Despite this, confidence in one's judgment was the primary driver of the demand for additional information about the news. Lower confidence predicted a stronger desire for extra information, regardless of the veracity judgment. Two key news characteristics led individuals to confidently misinterpret both true and fake news. News imprecision and news tendency to polarize opinions increased the likelihood of misjudgment, highlighting individuals' vulnerability to ambiguity. Structural equation modeling revealed that the demand for disambiguating information, driven by uncalibrated metacognition, became increasingly ineffective as individuals are drawn in by the ambiguity of the news. Our results underscore the importance of metacognitive abilities in mediating the relationship between assessing ambiguous information and the decision to seek or avoid more information.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Everything is connected: inference and attractors in delusions [^7d456375]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The idea of minds (and environments) as such multistable systems goes back to cybernetics and early psychological accounts of psychosis: e.g. of anxiety and threat generalization reinforcing each other, and today is standard in cognitive accounts of paranoia (e.g.;) and also of negative symptoms. It is challenging to model such processes within short experimental paradigms, but they may be key to explaining how relatively small differences in model parameters may develop into marked differences in behaviour. These marked behavioural differences may appear to constitute distinct 'disorders' – e.g. see the isolated group of deluded agents in Fig. 6 A – when in fact there is continuous variation in the underlying parameters.

We now comment on some specific aspects of the model. One important observation is that when likelihood precision is reduced, the prior belief that one will make correct decisions has a strong effect on evaluation of the feedback from that decision, even if the decision was arbitrary (Fig. 3 C). This may explain the well-known phenomenon of 'choice-induced preference change', whereby choices subsequently increase one's valuation of that choice. This occurs even following random choices, but not in choices allocated by computer, and increases with confidence in choice and uncertainty over values. 'Cognitive dissonance' theory was originally proposed as an explanation, but a simpler account is that subjects are inferring from their own behaviour, given their priors – indeed, post-judgement biases in perception can be modelled in a similar way. This constitutes a fourth dysfunctional 'attractor' in this system: how choices affect inferences, and inferences affect future choices.

### Molecular understanding of sulphuric acid-amine particle nucleation in the atmosphere [^711f9873]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

The ion-induced contribution to amine ternary nucleation is generally small, except at low overall formation rates. Ions can enhance nucleation either by an increased collision rate between a charged cluster and polar molecules (such as H₂SO₄ or H₂SO₄·DMA) or by an increased cluster binding energy (and hence decreased evaporation rate). Because neutral clusters of H₂SO₄ and DMA are highly stable, charge offers little competitive advantage. Taken together with previous CLOUD measurements, this suggests that ions can be significant in atmospheric particle formation provided that the associated neutral particles have appreciable evaporation and provided that the overall nucleation rates are low and below the ion-pair production rate.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considers that the increased amount of aerosol in the atmosphere from human activities constitutes the largest present uncertainty in climate radiative forcingand projected climate change this century. The results reported here show that the uncertainty is even greater than previously thought, because extremely low amine emissions — which have substantial anthropogenic sources and have not hitherto been considered by the IPCC — have a large influence on the nucleation of sulphuric acid particles. Moreover, amine scrubbing is likely to become the dominant technology for CO₂ capture from fossil-fuelled power plants, so anthropogenic amine emissions are expected to increase in the future. If amine emissions were to spread into pristine regions of the boundary layer where they could switch on nucleation, substantial increases in regional and global cloud condensation nuclei could occur. This underscores the importance of monitoring amine emissions — as well as those of sulphur dioxide — when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on the radiative forcing of regional and global climate by aerosols.

Bias recognition and mitigation in relationship-centered care advises clinicians to pause and reflect to interrupt biases and apply empathy and cultural humility to improve relationship-centered care, especially when there is racial, ethnic, or linguistic discordance between patients and physicians; it explains that physician's daily practice and medical decision making are shaped by cognitive heuristics that can pose the risk of creating cognitive errors that may bias medical decision making, notes reliance on decisional shortcuts such as Availability, Anchoring, Representativeness, and Confirmatory heuristics, and describes how implicit or unconscious biases and "controlling images" that are "uniformly negative" can dehumanize and discount marginalized populations.

### The role of phototherapy in the crash-cart approach to extreme neonatal jaundice [^cb9324c1]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Extreme neonatal jaundice occurs infrequently but carries a high risk of permanent sequelae (kernicterus) when it does. Rapid therapeutic intervention has the potential to reduce this risk in some infants. Several case reports of infants with acute intermediate to advanced bilirubin encephalopathy shows that reversal may be possible. Phototherapy can be instituted at the flip of a switch, whereas other therapeutic measures necessarily involve delays. Therefore, high-intensity phototherapy must be regarded as an emergency measure in infants presenting with extreme jaundice and even more so in the presence of neurological symptoms. The principal and well-described effect of phototherapy involves conversion of bilirubin IXα (z, z) to more polar isomers, which are excreted in bile and urine. When care is taken to maximize the spectral power of phototherapy lights, and whenever possible with measures added to reduce the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, very rapid reductions in total serum bilirubin levels are possible. A hypothesis has been advanced that conversion of bilirubin to more polar photoisomers, which can reach relative concentrations of 20%-25% of total serum bilirubin within 1–2 hours, might have a direct neuroprotective effect. This theory posits that because polar molecules generally require a transporter to cross the blood-brain barrier, bilirubin photoisomers should be less prone to enter the brain. Although this theory has some support in in vitro toxicity studies, the evidence is controversial. Until further experimental support can be gained, photoconversion of bilirubin does not constitute a viable argument against instituting further measures against bilirubin neurotoxicity, such as intravenous immune globulin (when indicated) and exchange transfusion. Conversely, neither is the state of evidence an argument against immediate and effective phototherapy in the medical emergency of extreme neonatal jaundice.

### Antarctica eye study: a prospective study of the effects of overwintering on ocular parameters and visual function [^982e974c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2013 five polar explorers attempted to complete the first Trans-Antarctic Winter Traverse (TAWT). This study presents the ophthalmological findings for this group, who overwintered in Antarctica as part of the White Mars Human Science Protocol. Antarctic crews are exposed to extreme cold, chronic hypoxia and altered day-night cycles. Previous studies of Antarctic explorers have focused on the prolonged effect of ultraviolet radiation including the development of ultraviolet keratitis and accelerated cataract formation. This is the first study of its kind to investigate the effect of overwintering in Antarctica on the human eye.

Methods

Pre and post-expedition clinical observations were made including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision, auto-refraction, subjective refraction, retinal examination, retinal autofluoresence and retinal thickness, which were graded for comparison. During the expedition additional observations were made on a monthly basis including LogMAR visual acuity, autorefraction and intraocular pressure.

Results

No significant differences between pre and post-expedition observations were found, including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision, refraction, visual fields, intraocular pressure and retinal examination. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in retinal thickness across all regions of the retina, except for the macular and fovea, in all explorers. Intra-expedition observations remained within normal limits.

Conclusion

Reassuringly, the human eye remains largely unchanged by exposure to the extreme conditions encountered during the Antarctic winter, however, further research is needed to investigate changes in retinal thickness. This may have implications for scientists who spend prolonged periods of time in the polar regions, as well as those who have prolonged exposure to the extreme cold or chronic hypoxia in other settings.

### Sources of confidence in value-based choice [^09bb36d7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A key aspect of this study is to test whether trial-to-trial fluctuations in the estimation of reward value have an impact on value-based decisions. Specifically, canonical theories of confidence predict that these trial-to-trial fluctuations impact the confidence reports because this variation directly affects evidence for choice. Using a multi-factor regression we found, as expected, that VD has an impact on confidence reports (β = 0.05 ± 0.01, P < 0.001; Fig. 1 b). However and surprisingly, trial-to-trial fluctuations in the estimation of reward values had no impact on confidence reports (β = 0.01 ± 0.02, P = 0.2; Fig. 1 b). Again, we tested whether the null model (Choice ~ VD + TV; which in this case excludes Var) is more credible than the full model (Confidence ~ VD + Var + TV). We found BF 01 = 450, which indicates "very strong" evidence for the absence of rating variability effects on confidence. Furthermore, we found a significant difference in the effect sizes of the regressor capturing trial-to-trial fluctuations of subjective valuation between the choice and confidence models (Δ β EffectSize = −1.11 ± 0.48, P = 0.01; Fig. 1 c), indicating specificity of the effect on choice consistency but not on confidence. Extending this trial-to-trial effect of rating variability, we observed that each participant's average level of variability in the rating task had a negative influence on average choice consistency of that participant (β = −0.58 ± 0.16, P < 0.001, r = −0.53; Fig. 1 d), and this effect was once again not present for the same analyses performed on confidence reports (β = −0.19 ± 0.18, P = 0.15, r = −0.22; Fig. 1 d). The difference of the effect of average variability on choice consistency and confidence ratings is marginally significant (Δ β cons−conf = −0.39 ± 0.24, P = 0.049; Fig. 1 d), however, this effect becomes more pronounced when removing two participants with outlying confidence rating behavior (Δ β cons−conf = −0.53 ± 0.25, P = 0.02; Fig. 1 d and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). Moreover, contrary to the findings in the choice consistency logistic regression, our data reveal that TV has a large positive impact on confidence reports (β = 0.28 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; Fig. 1 b). Once again, we found a significant difference in the effect sizes of the regressor capturing trial-to-trial fluctuations of subjective valuation between the choice consistency and confidence models (Δ β EffectSize = −0.82 ± 0.35, P = 0.009), but this time confirming the specificity of the TV effect on confidence but not on choice consistency.

### Interface-induced magnetic polar metal phase in complex oxides [^163205e9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Polar metals are commonly defined as metals with polar structural distortions. Strict symmetry restrictions make them an extremely rare breed as the structural constraints favor insulating over metallic phase. Moreover, no polar metals are known to be magnetic. Here we report on the realization of a magnetic polar metal phase in a BaTiO 3 /SrRuO 3 /BaTiO 3 heterostructure. Electron microscopy reveals polar lattice distortions in three-unit-cells thick SrRuO 3 between BaTiO 3 layers. Electrical transport and magnetization measurements reveal that this heterostructure possesses a metallic phase with high conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering with high saturation moment. The high conductivity in the SrRuO 3 layer can be attributed to the effect of electrostatic carrier accumulation induced by the BaTiO 3 layers. Density-functional-theory calculations provide insights into the origin of the observed properties of the thin SrRuO 3 film. The present results pave a way to design materials with desired functionalities at oxide interfaces.

### Ultra-high-resolution observations of persistent null-point reconnection in the solar corona [^828e15c8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Magnetic reconnection is a key mechanism involved in solar eruptions and is also a prime possibility to heat the low corona to millions of degrees. Here, we present ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet observations of persistent null-point reconnection in the corona at a scale of about 390kmover one hour observations of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The observations show formation of a null-point configuration above a minor positive polarity embedded within a region of dominant negative polarity near a sunspot. The gentle phase of the persistent null-point reconnection is evidenced by sustained point-like high-temperature plasma (about 10 MK) near the null-point and constant outflow blobs not only along the outer spine but also along the fan surface. The blobs appear at a higher frequency than previously observed with an average velocity of about 80 km s⁻¹ and life-times of about 40 s. The null-point reconnection also occurs explosively but only for 4 minutes, its coupling with a mini-filament eruption generates a spiral jet. These results suggest that magnetic reconnection, at previously unresolved scales, proceeds continually in a gentle and/or explosive way to persistently transfer mass and energy to the overlying corona.

### Trial-history biases in evidence accumulation can give rise to apparent lapses in decision-making [^0ee79625]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

It has long been known that experienced perceptual decision makers deviate from the predictions of optimal decision-theory, displaying several suboptimalities in their decision-making. Among the most pervasive of these is the dependence of behavior on the recent history of observed stimuli, performed actions, or experienced outcomes, despite it being disadvantageous and leading to worse performance – (schematized in Fig. 1 a top). History biases may arise due to a strategy that is optimized for naturalistic settings, where continual learning of priors, action-values, or other decision variables helps agents adapt to changing environments, but is maladaptive in experimental settings where the statistics of the environment are stationary. To date, decision-theoretic models have accommodated history biases by modeling them as a biasing factor on the perceptual evidence that drives choices. In the predominant conceptualization of these models, history biases can be overcome with sufficient perceptual evidence.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Worldwide divergence of values [^c84fbe3a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Analyzing value distinctiveness across countries also allowed us to estimate which countries have become most dissimilar from the rest of the world. Inglehart's post-materialist thesis suggests that high-income countries may hold especially distinctive values, at least in the domain of morality and tolerance. However, a range of other geopolitical variables could also lead cultures to adopt distinctive social values, including wealth inequality, distance from the equator, globalization, and the presence of a liberal democracy. We accessed data on these geopolitical metrics over time, and tested whether they could predict which countries were more distinctive and which countries were less distinctive. We retained the random effects structure from our previous mixed effects models to fit these results without violating any model assumptions.

In our regression analysis, GDP per capita was the only variable that significantly predicted value distinctiveness (see Table 2), b = 0.08, SE = 0.01, t (600.59) = 8.05, p < 0.001, = 0.18, 95% CI s [0.06, 0.10], with the positive coefficient indicating that higher-income countries have more distinctive values than lower-income countries. No other predictors reached significance (p s > 0.05). In our Supplementary Table 8, we show that other geopolitical variables are not significantly linked to value distinctiveness, even when we remove GDP per capita from the model.

### A unifying theory explains seemingly contradictory biases in perceptual estimation [^fca2b449]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Perceptual biases are widely regarded as offering a window into the neural computations underlying perception. To understand these biases, previous work has proposed a number of conceptually different, and even seemingly contradictory, explanations, including attraction to a Bayesian prior, repulsion from the prior due to efficient coding and central tendency effects on a bounded range. We present a unifying Bayesian theory of biases in perceptual estimation derived from first principles. We demonstrate theoretically an additive decomposition of perceptual biases into attraction to a prior, repulsion away from regions with high encoding precision and regression away from the boundary. The results reveal a simple and universal rule for predicting the direction of perceptual biases. Our theory accounts for, and yields, new insights regarding biases in the perception of a variety of stimulus attributes, including orientation, color and magnitude. These results provide important constraints on the neural implementations of Bayesian computations.

### Intuitions, principles and consequences [^8f27e0b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Some approaches to the assessment of moral intuitions are discussed. The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or modifies principles, which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, in which it is counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences.

### Tropical atlantic temperature seasonality at the end of the last interglacial [^fe9ef74f]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The end of the last interglacial period, ~118 kyr ago, was characterized by substantial ocean circulation and climate perturbations resulting from instabilities of polar ice sheets. These perturbations are crucial for a better understanding of future climate change. The seasonal temperature changes of the tropical ocean, however, which play an important role in seasonal climate extremes such as hurricanes, floods and droughts at the present day, are not well known for this period that led into the last glacial. Here we present a monthly resolved snapshot of reconstructed sea surface temperature in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean for 117.7 ± 0.8 kyr ago, using coral Sr/Ca and δ(18)O records. We find that temperature seasonality was similar to today, which is consistent with the orbital insolation forcing. Our coral and climate model results suggest that temperature seasonality of the tropical surface ocean is controlled mainly by orbital insolation changes during interglacials.

### Early warning signals of the termination of the African humid period (s) [^afe995ad]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The mid-Holocene climate transition from predominantly wet to dry conditions in tropical and subtropical northern Africa is the most dramatic example of a climate tipping point during the present interglacial. Climate tipping points occur when small perturbations in the forcing mechanism trigger a large, nonlinear response from the system, moving climate to a different future state generally accompanied by dramatic consequences for the biosphere –. The mid-Holocene climate transition underscores that the much-touted stability of the Holocene climate and its beneficial effects on the evolution of human societies do not hold true, at least not for the low latitudes. In fact, the transition from the African Humid Period (AHP), and with it the so-called Green Sahara phase, 15–5 kiloyears before present (kyr BP) to pronounced aridity after ~5 kyr BP led to significant changes in human environments in large areas of northern Africa.

The mid-Holocene climate transition was caused by the decrease in solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere driven by the Earth's climate precession. This change occurred slowly, as the sinusoidal period of precession is ~23 kyrs, whereas the more rapid quasilinear change in solar irradiance occurred during a quarter period of precession (~6 kyrs) between 9 and 3 kyr BP. The response of the climate system to the 7–8% decrease in solar irradiance within 6 kyrs was much more rapid, perhaps faster than ~200 years in western Africa, but up to 1000 years in eastern Africa. The main reason suggested for the rapid termination of the AHP is the positive feedback between the monsoon and vegetation that amplifies the comparatively small changes in external forcing.

### How to write a systematic review of reasons [^119f8c22]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Furthermore, unless conclusion types are extremely narrow, counts of reasons will cover reasons that were used to support slightly different conclusions. However, we note that classic systematic reviews face the analogous problem that the studies reviewed addressed slightly different research questions, and that such systematic reviews have developed appropriate strategies. We hypothesise that systematic reviews of reasons will frequently face this problem; research is needed on adapting existing strategies. Although a comparison between traditional systematic reviews and systematic reviews of reasons is beyond the scope of this paper, we would like to point out that the former are also subject to many types of bias. In any case, we recommend caution when computing counts and the presentation of qualitative results instead of counts whenever appropriate.

Applications of the model are needed to clarify further obstacles, to identify tactics for minimising external biases (eg, publication bias) and internal or review author-related biases (eg, selection bias and coding bias) and to develop means to evaluate the model.

### Evidence-based medicine: clinicians are taught to say it but not taught to think it [^4be5c5b7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

Some may contend that because much clinical decision-making is pattern recognition and/or subject to many well-described biases, there is no point in trying to impose on it or embed within it an explicitly rational structure. But all too often, these biases are invoked a specious effort to counter any endeavour to improve the transparency or clarity of clinical decision-making. Just because clinicians are not explicitly rational thinkers all the time (nor should they be), it does not mean they should not be rational thinkers sometimes, particularly when scientific evidence is robust. After all, what patient would choose a clinician that never thinks rationally? Additionally, it is important to note that my perspective is not universally held. Some would consider BHEs no more easy to formulate than quantitative specifications of prior probability distributions, especially if any new evidence is viewed sceptically. Others would omit experiential data from EBM on the grounds that it is not really evidence.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^9e9d664f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cellular activation in HIV and atherosclerosis — following CD4 depletion, HIV-infected persons experience "immune dysregulation" with "low numbers of naïve T cells", more terminally differentiated effector T cells, "excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines", and altered T cell function. The "chronically activated immune system generates excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with end-organ disease", and "even with suppressive ART, T cell activation remains elevated". Evidence also suggests the "innate immune system" may play a larger role than the adaptive in persistent inflammation. Monocyte shifts contribute to atheroma: in HIV-negative ASCVD there is "a greater proportion of pro-inflammatory monocytes", and in HIV, "even with ART and viral suppression", these subsets are "overrepresented" and contribute to "atherosclerosis". Neutrophils have "emerged as important contributors" and in HIV their "activation and degranulation is increased and remains elevated even with suppressive ART", with dysregulated neutrophils "likely another immune mechanism driving accelerated atherosclerosis". Coagulation and platelet processes are "dysregulated with HIV infection" and "even with suppressive ART, markers of coagulation (e.g. D-dimer) remain elevated and are associated with end-organ disease".

### Mapping the velocity vector onto the spin vector: two-dimensional velocity-selective spin excitation for MR flow imaging [^ac4ec40a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This article presents a two-dimensional velocity-selective spin excitation (2D-VSP) method that enables quantitative imaging of motion in two directions in a single scan, without the need for image subtraction or combination. It is based on the idea of mapping a 2D velocity vector directly onto the transverse magnetization vector, such that the signal intensity reflects the speed of motion, while the signal phase represents the direction of motion. Experimental demonstration is presented in conjunction with an analysis of the accuracy of this method. VSP methods are often limited by inconsistent static signal suppression under variable shim and RF conditions. By using adiabatic RF pulses in a 2D-VSP composite that possesses time-reversal symmetry, consistent background suppression of 30-fold or higher was demonstrated over experimental conditions of ± 200 Hz off-resonance and 30% RF field variation.

### Dr. janet E. helms: envisioning and creating a more humane psychological science, theory, and practice [^5c8b15a7]. The American Psychologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Dr. Janet E. Helms's use of psychological science to engage the field of psychology in radical progressive debates about race and identity is unprecedented. Her scholarship transformed prevailing paradigms in identity development theory and cognitive ability testing in psychology, to name a few. However, mainstream psychology often ignores, dismisses, and minimizes the importance of Dr. Helms's scientific contributions. Despite the numerous systemic barriers she encounters as a Black woman in psychology, Dr. Helms has persisted and made immeasurable contributions to the field and society. The intellectual gifts she has provided have shaped psychology for decades and will undoubtedly continue to do so for centuries to come. This article aims to provide an overview of Dr. Helms's lifetime contributions to psychology and the social sciences. To achieve this goal, we provide a brief narrative of Dr. Helms's life as a prelude to describing her foundational contributions to psychological science and practice in four domains, including (a) racial identity theories, (b) racially conscious and culturally responsive praxis, (c) womanist identity, and (d) racial biases in cognitive ability tests and measurement. The article concludes with a summary of Dr. Helms's legacy as an exceptional psychologist who offers the quintessential blueprint for envisioning and creating a more humane psychological science, theory, and practice anchored in liberation for all.

### Network temperature as a metric of stability in depression symptoms across adolescence [^23ac090f]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Network temperature has emerged in causal attitude networks (for example, political attitudes where nodes represent thoughts and feelings) – and cognitive belief networksthat apply the Ising model representation of nodes in binary states. These systems tend toward an overall low-energy state of node alignment, where the probability of the overall network state depends on the amount of energy within the network. In attitude networks, directed attention (lower temperature) results in lower attitudinal entropy and increased stability. For example, when a political voter directs their cognitive attention on a specific issue, such as healthcare reform, the variability (entropy) of their attitude toward this issue decreases, leading to a more stable and consistent stance. In belief networks, individuals with high dissonance (belief inconsistency) are associated with low-temperature networks, where tightly connected beliefs amplify the drive to reduce dissonance by changing specific beliefs. Conversely, high temperature networks are characterized by a more malleable belief system but less pressure to resolve inconsistencies. Consequently, temperature represents a global parameter of the network state, scaling both the connectedness of the network, which indicates a general predisposition to an attitude or belief and the thresholds of the network, reflecting external influences on thoughts.

We can bring this idea to psychological symptom networks. The concepts of network temperature and entropy may be valuable in better describing stability in depression and enhancing understanding of risk and resilience. The model of psychiatric disorders as dynamical systems parallels this theory by describing two alternative 'basins of attraction' characterized by a resilient healthy and resilient disorder state in early and recent work. The theory would suggest that both someone who is persistently depressed and someone who never experiences depressive symptoms have low temperature, stable networks in more fixed states (Fig. 1b). Conversely, someone with consistently fluctuating depression state or symptoms would have a high temperature network which exhibits increased variability (Fig. 1c).

We explore the hypothesis that symptom networks stabilize across adolescence. Research shows that emotional regulation improves with age, while emotional fluctuations are pronounced during puberty and adolescence. Depression trajectories also reveal increased symptom heterogeneity during adolescence, but as individuals approach adulthood, they tend to diverge toward two groups: nondepressed and persistently depressed, suggesting that individual symptoms stabilize over time.

### The value of beliefs [^ba2ffc34]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

We construct our beliefs to meet two sometimes conflicting goals: forming accurate beliefs to inform our decisions and forming desirable beliefs that we value for their own sake. In this NeuroView, we consider emerging neuroscience evidence on how the brain motivates itself to form particular beliefs and why it does so.

Excess microbial translocation in HIV — early "depletion of CD4 cells from gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a signature feature of HIV infection", and "GALT constitutes the largest immune compartment in the body". This depletion "causes profound changes in the gut mucosal integrity, facilitating bacterial translocation, augmenting trafficking of inflammatory cells to the gastrointestinal tract, and promoting chronic systemic immune activation". Consequently, "activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system ensues and a state of chronic inflammation and immune activation is created", with "elevated inflammatory biomarkers" measurable, including markers of microbial translocation, monocyte and neutrophil activation, adhesion molecules, coagulation markers, and "fibrin degradation products (e.g. D-dimer)". Thus, "changes in the GALT have profound ramifications for end-organ disease in the setting of HIV infection".
