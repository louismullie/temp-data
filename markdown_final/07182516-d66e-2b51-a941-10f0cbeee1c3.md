## Question

splenomegaly treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about splenomegaly treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing etiology. Then, I should verify the severity and symptom burden. Next, I will consider disease-specific medical therapies, followed by indications and techniques for splenectomy. After that, I need to review splenic irradiation and other local modalities. Finally, I should confirm supportive care, special populations, and a practical decision algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and etiology, because treatment hinges on the underlying cause. Abdominal ultrasound is the first-line imaging to confirm splenomegaly and to screen for concurrent liver disease or portal hypertension, while a careful history and exam guide the differential toward infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic etiologies, and basic labs including CBC, liver panel, and infectious serologies are foundational to narrow the cause before committing to disease-specific therapy [^d79652c2] [^fd18e033].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and symptom burden before jumping to interventions. I should quantify spleen size by palpation and imaging, document cytopenias from hypersplenism, and assess mechanical symptoms such as early satiety, abdominal pain, and cachexia, because these factors determine whether observation or active therapy is appropriate and influence the choice of modality, especially in myelofibrosis where splenomegaly correlates with symptom burden and quality of life impact [^6097586e] [^d79652c2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal treatment. I need to ensure I anchor on treating the underlying disease first, since splenomegaly is almost always a manifestation of a systemic process. For example, in malaria or schistosomiasis, targeted antiparasitic therapy is essential, and in liver disease, management of portal hypertension and the hepatic process comes first, reserving splenectomy or radiation for refractory cases or specific indications [^d79652c2] [^f2c309af].

> Next, I should review myelofibrosis-specific medical therapy, because this is where JAK inhibitors change the game. Ruxolitinib produces durable reductions in spleen volume and meaningful symptom improvement in randomized trials, with about 28% achieving at least a 35% spleen volume reduction at 48 weeks versus 0% with best available therapy, and responses are independent of JAK2 V617F status, establishing ruxolitinib as a standard first-line option for symptomatic splenomegaly in intermediate-2 or high-risk disease [^e2ed197c] [^95b3c1cb].

> I should double-check alternatives and sequencing in myelofibrosis, especially when cytopenias or intolerance emerge. Fedratinib and pacritinib are FDA-approved JAK inhibitors with distinct toxicity profiles, and momelotinib, which also targets ACVR1, offers additional anemia benefit. NCCN supports switching within class for intolerance or suboptimal response, and real-world data suggest many patients lose ruxolitinib benefit over time, reinforcing the need for timely switches and careful monitoring for withdrawal phenomena when discontinuing JAK inhibitors [^33e882ee] [^76825e10] [^8565120e].

> Let me consider splenectomy indications and risks, and I should confirm that surgery is reserved for carefully selected patients. Indications include drug-refractory symptomatic splenomegaly, transfusion-dependent anemia from hypersplenism, or portal hypertension, but morbidity and mortality are nontrivial in massive splenomegaly, with historical series showing 30% morbidity and 9% mortality, and contemporary series still reporting 20% complications and 1.8% 30-day mortality, so patient selection and center expertise are critical [^b866ffce] [^d6d09fac].

> I need to check surgical approach and perioperative strategy. Minimally invasive splenectomy is preferred when feasible, and hand-assisted laparoscopy facilitates safe removal of very large spleens while reducing conversion rates. Preoperative vaccination against encapsulated organisms and postoperative anticoagulation to mitigate thrombocytosis and thrombosis are standard, and platelet transfusion thresholds and heparin prophylaxis should be individualized to bleeding and thrombotic risk [^246999c3] [^506471e5] [^93aa749d].

> But wait, what if the patient is not a surgical candidate or declines surgery. Splenic irradiation offers palliation with rapid spleen shrinkage and symptom relief, though responses are often transient and cytopenias can worsen. Low-dose regimens such as 3–10 Gy in 1 Gy fractions are commonly used, and emerging MR-guided techniques may improve targeting and reduce toxicity, though evidence remains limited and retrospective [^2e165978] [^720e6795] [^9784a0ad].

> I should confirm the role of splenic irradiation in the transplant setting, where it may be uniquely beneficial. Pre-transplant splenic irradiation can reduce spleen size and has been associated with improved engraftment and lower relapse in some series, and low-dose protocols immediately before conditioning are being explored as a less invasive alternative to splenectomy in JAK inhibitor–refractory patients, though prospective validation is needed [^03c68c55] [^7621cf30].

> Next, I should review other hematologic diseases where splenectomy remains relevant. In hairy cell leukemia, splenectomy is reasonable for symptomatic splenomegaly with minimal marrow disease, though modern chemoimmunotherapy has reduced its frequency. In splenic marginal zone lymphoma, splenectomy or rituximab-based therapy are acceptable first-line options depending on symptoms, cytopenias, and disease distribution. And in hereditary hemolytic anemias such as hereditary spherocytosis, splenectomy improves anemia but carries lifelong infection and thrombotic risks, so decisions should weigh severity and age carefully [^c4de61fc] [^81bdc4b1] [^538b8d02].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive care and safety counseling, because splenomegaly and asplenia increase vulnerability. Patients with impaired splenic function require vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Hib, and many should receive annual influenza vaccine. After splenectomy, daily penicillin prophylaxis for at least 1–2 years and emergency antibiotics for fever are recommended, and patients should avoid contact sports when splenomegaly is present to reduce rupture risk [^8d633fdf] [^6c974614] [^d79652c2].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contexts. In sickle cell disease, recurrent acute splenic sequestration or severe hypersplenism justify splenectomy after transfusion optimization, but functional asplenia is common even without surgery, so infection prophylaxis is essential. In refugees from malaria-endemic regions, persistent splenomegaly may reflect incomplete treatment or alternative etiologies, and CDC recommends primaquine for liver-stage parasites when G6PD normal and repeated antischistosomal therapy as indicated [^5eef7e8f] [^f2c309af].

> I should double-check that my decision algorithm is coherent and evidence-aligned. Start with etiologic diagnosis and treat the cause, assess symptom burden and cytopenias, observe if asymptomatic, initiate disease-specific therapy such as JAK inhibitors for symptomatic myelofibrosis, escalate to splenectomy or splenic irradiation if refractory or transplant is planned, and embed supportive care throughout. This stepwise approach balances benefit and risk while aligning with contemporary guidelines and trial data [^d79652c2] [^33e882ee] [^2e165978].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed limitations and uncertainties. Much of the splenectomy literature is retrospective and heterogeneous, JAK inhibitor durability varies and many patients discontinue within 3 years, and splenic irradiation lacks randomized data, so shared decision-making and enrollment in clinical trials when available are crucial to optimize outcomes and advance care [^76825e10] [^03c68c55] [^720e6795].

Treatment of splenomegaly centers on **treating the underlying cause** [^d79652c2] (infection, liver disease, malignancy, or hematologic disorder) and using **JAK inhibitors** for symptomatic myelofibrosis [^e2ed197c] [^33e882ee]. Splenectomy is reserved for **refractory cases** [^2fd82725] or when malignancy is suspected, and splenic irradiation is a palliative option for inoperable patients [^2e165978]. Supportive care includes vaccinations, infection prophylaxis, and avoiding contact sports to reduce rupture risk [^8d633fdf] [^d79652c2]. Management should be individualized based on etiology, symptoms, and patient factors, with multidisciplinary input for complex cases [^6c974614].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy aims to **reduce spleen size**, alleviate symptoms, and address the underlying disease [^d79652c2].

- **JAK inhibitors**: Ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib, and momelotinib are first-line for symptomatic myelofibrosis, reducing spleen size and improving symptoms [^e2ed197c] [^33e882ee] [^b8cbb827].

- **Hydroxyurea**: Used for myeloproliferative neoplasms to reduce spleen size and control blood counts [^82a7db18].

- **Chemoimmunotherapy**: Rituximab-based regimens for lymphoproliferative disorders with splenomegaly [^notfound].

- **Antiviral therapy**: For hepatitis-related splenomegaly, targeting the underlying liver disease [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is considered for **refractory splenomegaly**, diagnostic uncertainty, or when malignancy is suspected [^2fd82725].

- **Splenectomy**: Indicated for drug-refractory symptomatic splenomegaly, suspected malignancy, or hypersplenism causing severe cytopenias [^2fd82725] [^9171882e].

- **Laparoscopic splenectomy**: Preferred for smaller spleens; hand-assisted techniques are used for massive splenomegaly to reduce conversion rates [^8781eedc] [^93aa749d].

- **Risks**: Bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and lifelong risk of overwhelming sepsis; preoperative vaccination and postoperative prophylaxis are essential [^6c974614] [^8d633fdf].

---

## Radiation therapy

Radiation is a **palliative option** for patients unfit for surgery or with refractory symptoms [^2e165978].

- **Splenic irradiation**: Low-dose regimens (e.g. 3–10 Gy) provide transient symptom relief and spleen reduction, but effects are short-lived and cytopenias are common [^9f24aa77].

- **MR-guided radiation**: Emerging technique allowing precise targeting and adaptive planning, with early data showing symptom relief and spleen reduction [^720e6795] [^9784a0ad].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive measures are essential to **prevent complications** and improve quality of life [^d79652c2].

- **Vaccinations**: Pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hib, and annual influenza vaccines for patients with functional asplenia or post-splenectomy [^8d633fdf].

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. penicillin) for asplenic patients, especially children [^6c974614].

- **Activity modification**: Avoid contact sports to reduce rupture risk in patients with significant splenomegaly [^d79652c2].

---

## Special considerations

Certain conditions require **tailored approaches**:

- **Myelofibrosis**: JAK inhibitors are first-line; splenectomy or irradiation for refractory cases [^33e882ee] [^2fd82725].

- **Lymphoproliferative disorders**: Chemoimmunotherapy or splenectomy based on disease stage and symptoms [^876ef75b] [^81bdc4b1].

- **Hereditary hemolytic anemias**: Splenectomy for severe hypersplenism or transfusion dependence, balancing infection and thrombosis risks [^538b8d02].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **treatment response**, detect complications, and adjust therapy. Key elements include periodic clinical assessment of spleen size and symptoms, laboratory monitoring of CBC, liver function, and disease-specific markers, and imaging with ultrasound or MRI as indicated to evaluate spleen size and disease progression [^d79652c2].

---

Treatment of splenomegaly is **multidisciplinary**, with medical therapy targeting the cause, surgery for refractory or diagnostic cases, and radiation for palliation. Supportive care and individualized planning are critical to outcomes.

Treatment of splenomegaly

It is generally agreed that, if patients with MF have no symptoms, a wait-and-see approach is a reasonable option, with treatment being delayed until significant changes are observed.It is likely that such conservative approach will change as soon as more effective therapies for the disease will become available. The above wait-and-see policy also applies to asymptomatic splenomegaly, especially taking into account that MF patients have often concurrent cytopenias that may worsen following treatment institution.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^802a2d55]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

MF is an infrequent disease that usually affects elderly people.Currently, median survival approaches 6 years, but there is a wide variability, ranging from less than 1 year to more than 2 decades.A number of prognostic factors have been identified and, recently, important progress has been made in the prognostic stratification of MF patients, both at diagnosisand during the disease evolution,, with four prognostic groups with markedly different survival having been recognized (Table 1).

MF is a heterogeneous disease, not only with regard to its prognosis but also to its clinical and hematologic manifestations. Around 30% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis and can remain in this fashion for variable periods of time.However, most patients have symptoms already at presentation, most frequently derived from anemia and splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. To date, allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only therapy with the potential for curing MF,, but, in practice, owing to the advanced age of most patients, the lack of donor and, especially, the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure, allo-HSCT is restricted to a few patients, usually included within the intermediate-2 and high-risk prognostic categories. Therefore, for the majority of patients with MF, the disease remains incurable, with its therapy being merely palliative. Because of this, and given the heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations of the MF, it is important to adjust the treatment to the characteristics of the disease in each individual patient.

### Current treatment algorithm for the management of patients with myelofibrosis, JAK inhibitors, and beyond [^373959e0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, ineffective hematopoiesis, and an inherent risk of leukemic transformation. The past decade has seen a massive shift in available therapeutic options for our patients and we are learning how and when to use novel agents, either alone or in combination, during the disease course. This has translated into improved management of splenomegaly, significant amelioration in disease-related symptom burden for many, and may lead to improved survival. But limitations in the therapeutic options remain. Moreover, enhanced delineation of the mutational landscape of MF has offered both increasingly complex prognostic algorithms and yielded further potential therapeutic avenues. In this review, we will focus on stratifying both standard and experimental therapeutic management in 2017 and 2018 and postulate on the emerging treatments that will likely become part of our increasingly complex treatment algorithm.

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults (...) [^6c974614]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Management Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Depending on the level of experience of each physician, hepatology or hematology referrals may be warranted for definitive diagnosis and management. With guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or infectious disease consultants, many of the infectious causes of splenomegaly can be managed by family physicians. 8 Spleen reduction therapies and splenectomy are occasionally used for painful splenomegaly or in malignancies. Splenectomy can be performed to control esophageal varices in liver disease or to control pain and other symptoms caused by massive splenomegaly. 24, 25 Fevers are particularly concerning in these patients because progression to sepsis occurs more rapidly compared with individuals who have functioning spleens. Febrile patients with impaired splenic function should receive empiric antibiotic therapy.

Daily antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for one to two years after splenectomy, before respiratory tract procedures, and in any asplenic patient who has developed sepsis. Oral penicillin twice daily is typically used for antibiotic therapy after splenectomy and before procedures. If an asplenic patient develops a fever but does not appear ill, immediate administration of ceftriaxone is recommended. Patients who appear ill or who have laboratory results consistent with infection should be treated with cefepime and vancomycin. Asplenic patients should be prescribed an emergency oral dose of antibiotics to take in the case of a fever if they are unable to get to a medical facility that can administer intravenous antibiotics within two hours. Amoxicillin or levofloxacin are the preferred agents. Booster doses of PPSV23 and MenACWY will be needed.

### Laparoscopic treatment of splenomegaly (...) [^8781eedc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions HALS can minimize surgical trauma in patients with massive splenomegaly who otherwise would be candidates only for open surgery and results in a clinical outcome similar to that of conventional laparoscopy. With the availability of HALS, any patient with splenomegaly can be offered a minimally invasive surgical option. Portal system thrombosis is common, regardless of the surgical technique. Minimally invasive surgical treatment of patients with splenomegaly is associated with high risk of intraoperative bleeding and conversion to open surgery. 1 The adoption of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery in this setting has been advocated to reduce the rate of conversion to laparotomy and to improve the postoperative course of patients who otherwise would be candidates only for open surgery.

2 However, the use of HALS has been reported at few dedicated centers, 3-5 and some investigators question the value of a minimally invasive surgical approach to treat patients with splenomegaly. 6, 7. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed a 10-year single-surgeon experience in minimally invasive surgical treatment of splenomegaly. Regardless of the size of his or her spleen, every patient seen with splenomegaly had been offered a minimally invasive surgical approach by HALS splenectomy or by conventional laparoscopic splenectomy. Outcome measures were compared between patients managed with the 2 techniques in an attempt to elucidate their risks and benefits in this setting. During the 10-year period of this study, 85 consecutive patients with splenomegaly were considered for laparoscopic splenectomy at the Department of General Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.

The chosen operative technique was HALS splenectomy in 43 patients and conventional laparoscopic splenectomy in 42 patients. Characteristics of patients in the 2 study groups are given in Table 1, and indications for splenectomy are given in Table 2. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that selective use of HALS allows surgeons to manage splenomegaly of any size using a minimally invasive surgical approach, which has a clinical outcome similar to that of conventional laparoscopy. We analyzed a single surgeon's experience among a series of 85 patients with splenomegaly treated by a minimally invasive surgical approach using HALS or conventional laparoscopy.

### How I treat symptomatic splenomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^835b2941]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Managing patients with myelofibrosis (MF), either those with primary MF or those whose MF has evolved from antecedent polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, presents many challenges to the hematologist. MF patients have a range of debilitating disease manifestations (eg, massive splenomegaly, cytopenias, constitutional symptoms, and transformation to a treatment-refractory blast phase). Cure is potentially achievable through allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, this therapy is either inappropriate or not feasible for the majority of patients. Therefore, remaining therapies are palliative but can be of significant value to some MF patients. In particular, management of symptomatic splenomegaly remains one of the most perplexing aspects of MF clinical care. Using medications is the simplest approach for reducing splenomegaly, yet achieving symptomatic response without undue myelosuppression is challenging. Splenectomy or radiotherapy offers benefit, but careful patient selection and close monitoring are required because both have the potential for dangerous adverse effects. Experimental medical therapies, such as JAK2 inhibitors, show promise and may soon play an important role in the management of symptomatic splenomegaly in MF patients. Future care of MF patients, including splenomegaly management, will continue to require the hematologist to select therapeutic options carefully in the context of realistic, achievable goals.

### How I diagnose and treat splenic lymphomas [^62f3ebc8]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The incidental finding of an isolated splenomegaly during clinical assessment of patients evaluated for unrelated causes has become increasingly frequent because of the widespread use of imaging. Therefore, the challenging approach to the differential diagnosis of spleen disorders has emerged as a rather common issue of clinical practice. A true diagnostic dilemma hides in distinguishing pathologic conditions primarily involving the spleen from those in which splenomegaly presents as an epiphenomenon of hepatic or systemic diseases. Among the causes of isolated splenomegaly, lymphoid malignancies account for a relevant, yet probably underestimated, number of cases. Splenic lymphomas constitute a wide and heterogeneous array of diseases, whose clinical behavior spans from indolent to highly aggressive. Such a clinical heterogeneity is paralleled by the high degree of biologic variation in the lymphoid populations from which they originate. Nevertheless, the presenting clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features of these diseases often display significant overlaps. In this manuscript, we present our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these rare lymphomas, whose complexity has been so far determined by the lack of prospectively validated prognostic systems, treatment strategies, and response criteria.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^e993ebfa]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Symptomatic splenomegaly, a frequent manifestation of myelofibrosis (MF), represents a therapeutic challenge. It is frequently accompanied by constitutional symptoms and by anemia or other cytopenias, which make treatment difficult, as the latter are often worsened by most current therapies. Cytoreductive treatment, usually hydroxyurea, is the first-line therapy, being effective in around 40% of the patients, although the effect is often short lived. The immunomodulatory drugs, such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, rarely show a substantial activity in reducing the splenomegaly. Splenectomy can be considered in patients refractory to drug treatment, but the procedure involves substantial morbidity as well as a certain mortality risk and, therefore, patient selection is important. For patients not eligible for splenectomy, transient relief of the symptoms can be obtained with local radiotherapy that, in turn, can induce severe and long-lasting cytopenias. Allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment with the potential for curing MF but, due to its associated morbidity and mortality, is usually restricted to a minority of patients with poor risk features. A new class of drugs, the JAK2 inhibitors, although also palliative, are promising in the splenomegaly of MF and will probably change the therapeutic algorithm of this disease.

### NCCN debuts new guidelines for myeloproliferative neoplasms [^edd8c2b3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

For the first time, NCCN has published guidelines specifically geared toward treating myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The first set of guidelines was developed for myelofibrosis (MF), and was presented at the NCCN 22nd Annual Conference. Future guidelines will be issued for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytopenia, and atypical MPNs. Patients with MF can have an unpredictable course, one that is largely dependent on the presence of certain molecular alterations. Models are currently emerging that take into account molecular factors. Only one drug is currently approved for MF, the oral JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, which has been shown to significantly reduce splenomegaly and improve symptoms.

### Magnetic resonance imaging guided radiation therapy for splenomegaly: clinical experiences and technical tips [^9784a0ad]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the field of hematological malignancies, as demonstrated in our study, MRgRT offers promise in managing splenomegaly, providing rapid symptom relief and substantial spleen volume reduction.

As interesting as this treatment approach is, its retrospective nature, small sample size, and consequently the lack of detailed statistical analysis should be considered when interpreting the results.

Other limitations to be considered are the heterogeneous population included in the study, which may make it difficult to draw specific conclusions on treatment efficacy for each subgroup, and the short follow-up period, especially in patients undergoing HCT, may not give full information on long-term survival outcomes, which are crucial in assessing treatment efficacy.

Furthermore, the absence of a comparison group and comprehensive clinical endpoints warrants a cautious interpretation of the results.

Additional research with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and more comprehensive outcome measures is needed to better understand the potential benefits and limitations of this treatment approach.

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults [^d79652c2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly can be due to several mechanisms but is almost always a sign of a systemic condition. Patient habits, travel, and medical conditions can increase risk of splenomegaly and suggest etiology. Symptoms can suggest infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic causes. Physical examination will typically reveal splenomegaly, but abdominal ultrasonography is recommended for confirmation. Physical examination should also assess for signs of systemic illness, liver disease, and anemia or other hematologic issues. The most common causes of splenomegaly in the United States are liver disease, malignancy, and infection. Except for apparent causes such as infectious mononucleosis, basic laboratory analysis and ultrasonography are the first-line steps in determining etiology. Malaria and schistosomiasis are common in tropical regions, where as many as 80% of people may have splenomegaly. Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Splenectomies and spleen reduction therapies are sometimes performed. Any patient with limited splenic function requires increased vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics for procedures involving the respiratory tract. Acute infections, anemia, and splenic rupture are the most common complications of splenomegaly, and people with splenomegaly should refrain from participating in contact sports to decrease risk of rupture.

### How to manage the transplant question in myelofibrosis [^4324c87c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Choice of treatment

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) remains the only known curative therapy for myelofibrosis, other treatment options must be considered, especially for patients with lower risk disease. These options include observation, erythroid-stimulating agents, hydroxyurea, prednisone, thalidomide or lenalidomide. Response rates, including improvement in blood counts and splenomegaly, vary but are about 20%.Low-dose radiation treatments or splenectomy can also be helpful for painful splenomegaly.These treatments may be helpful for palliation of symptoms, but the responses are of short duration, usually less than 1 year.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary myelofibrosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, BCSH 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that disease symptoms and splenomegaly will recur on drug withdrawal, sometimes rapidly. Taper the dose gradually over 7-10 days and avoid sudden interruptions. Consider covering with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 20-30 mg).

### Predictive models for splenic response to JAK-inhibitor therapy in patients with myelofibrosis [^1b5f382a]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2019). Medium credibility.

JAK inhibitors for myelofibrosis (MF) reduce spleen size, control constitutional symptoms, and may improve survival. We studied the clinical characteristics of 548 MF patients treated with JAK inhibitors from 2008 to 2016 to better understand predictors of splenic response. Response was defined as a 50% decrease in spleen size at early (3-4 months on therapy) and late (5-12 months) timepoints after therapy initiation. Early response positively correlated with higher doses of JAK inhibitor, baseline spleen size 5-10cm, and hemoglobin. Early response negatively correlated with baseline spleen size >20cm and high WBC. The strongest predictor of late response was whether a patient had a response at the earlier timepoint (OR 8.88). Our response models suggest that clinical factors can be used to predict which patients are more likely to respond to JAK inhibitors, and those who do not achieve an early response, i.e. within 3-4 months, should consider alternative treatments.

### Splenomegaly in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: a position paper on behalf of the chronic malignancies working party of the EBMT [^f31c29f8]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Splenomegaly is a hallmark of myelofibrosis, a debilitating haematological malignancy for which the only curative option is allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Considerable splenic enlargement might be associated with a higher risk of delayed engraftment and graft failure, increased non-relapse mortality, and worse overall survival after HCT as compared with patients without significantly enlarged splenomegaly. Currently, there are no standardised guidelines to assist transplantation physicians in deciding optimal management of splenomegaly before HCT. Therefore, the aim of this Position Paper is to offer a shared position statement on this issue. An international group of haematologists, transplantation physicians, gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, and radiologists with experience in the treatment of myelofibrosis contributed to this Position Paper. The key issues addressed by this group included the assessment, prevalence, and clinical significance of splenomegaly, and the need for a therapeutic intervention before HCT for the control of splenomegaly. Specific scenarios, including splanchnic vein thrombosis and COVID-19, are also discussed. All patients with myelofibrosis must have their spleen size assessed before allogeneic HCT. Myelofibrosis patients with splenomegaly measuring 5 cm and larger, particularly when exceeding 15 cm below the left costal margin, or with splenomegaly-related symptoms, could benefit from treatment with the aim of reducing the spleen size before HCT. In the absence of, or loss of, response, patients with increasing spleen size should be evaluated for second-line options, depending on availability, patient fitness, and centre experience. Splanchnic vein thrombosis is not an absolute contraindication for HCT, but a multidisciplinary approach is warranted. Finally, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 should adhere to standard recommendations for immunocompromised patients.

### Ten years after ruxolitinib approval for myelofibrosis: a review of clinical efficacy [^95b3c1cb]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by splenomegaly, abnormal cytokine expression, cytopenias, and progressive bone marrow fibrosis. The disease often manifests with burdensome symptoms and is associated with reduced survival. Ruxolitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 inhibitor, was the first agent approved for MF. As a first-in-class targeted treatment, ruxolitinib approval transformed the MF treatment approach and remains standard of care. In addition, targeted inhibition of JAK1/JAK2 signaling, a key molecular pathway underlying MF pathogenesis, and the large volume of literature evaluating ruxolitinib, have led to a better understanding of the disease and improved management in general. Here we review ruxolitinib efficacy in patients with MF in the 10years following approval, including demonstration of clinical benefit in the phase 3 COMFORT-I/II trials, real-world evidence, translational studies, and expanded access data. Lastly, future directions for MF treatment are discussed, including ruxolitinib-based combination therapies.

### Patterns of ruxolitinib therapy failure and its management in myelofibrosis: perspectives of the Canadian myeloproliferative neoplasm group [^76825e10]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Ruxolitinib improves splenomegaly and other disease-related symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis, but over time, many patients lose this benefit. It is difficult to determine whether this is due to resistance or intolerance to the drug; thus, we have used the more inclusive term of ruxolitinib failure. The survival of patients with myelofibrosis after ruxolitinib failure is poor but varies significantly by the pattern of the failure, underlining the need for a clinically appropriate classification. In this review, we propose diagnostic guidance for early recognition of the pattern of ruxolitinib failure and we recommend treatment options. The most frequent patterns of ruxolitinib failure are loss or failure to obtain a significant reduction in splenomegaly or symptom response, and the development or persistence of clinically significant cytopenias. Ruxolitinib dose modification and other ancillary therapies are sometimes helpful, and splenectomy is a palliative option in selected cases. Stem-cell transplantation is the only curative option for these patterns of failure, but its restricted applicability due to toxicity highlights the importance of ongoing clinical trials in this area. Recent approval of fedratinib by the US Food and Drug Administration provides an alternative option for patients with suboptimal or loss of spleen response. The transformation of myelofibrosis to accelerated or blast phase is an infrequent form of failure with an extremely poor prognosis, whereby patients who are ineligible for transplantation have limited treatment options.

### Magnetic resonance imaging guided radiation therapy for splenomegaly: clinical experiences and technical tips [^3c604583]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this single-center retrospective analysis, we have explored the feasibility of MRgRT for SI in patients with MFI and MDS/MPN. Our findings suggest that MRgRT, with its real-time setup verification, adaptive planning, and reduced treatment margins, offers a promising approach for spleen irradiation, leading to substantial reductions in spleen volume and symptomatic relief.

Moving forward, larger prospective studies with extended follow-up periods and well-defined clinical endpoints are imperative to validate the efficacy and safety of MRgRT in the management of splenomegaly across various hematological conditions. Despite these limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of MRgRT as a treatment modality for splenomegaly, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of RT techniques in hematological malignancies.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^9f24aa77]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy

Splenic radiation can be used to reduce the spleen size and procure symptom relief. Total doses range from 0.15 to 65 Gy per course, administered in a fractioned form. It can be indicated in poor candidates to surgery and for palliation of severe pain from spleen infarct, but its effect is not durable, whereas the risk of severe and long-lasting cytopenias, with subsequent infection and bleeding, is high, probably due to an effect on the circulating progenitors. Therefore, routine use of splenic irradiation in patients with MF should not be recommended. In this sense, in an attempt to prolong the therapeutic effect of splenic irradiation while avoiding pancytopenia, an induction-maintenance strategy, consisting of administration of lower radiation doses during induction followed by maintenance with the same or lower doses, was recently reported to control not only the splenomegaly but also the signs of disease acceleration in two MF patients.On the other hand, splenic radiation to reduce the spleen size in preparation for splenectomy is not advised, given the higher rate of post-surgical bleeding observed in such cases,probably related to the development of splenic adhesions to the abdominal wall and the surrounding viscera.

### Magnetic resonance imaging guided radiation therapy for splenomegaly: clinical experiences and technical tips [^720e6795]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Splenomegaly is a common manifestation in chronic lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. Although splenectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic splenomegaly, it carries significant risks. Radiation therapy (RT) has traditionally been considered a palliative option. This study explores the use of magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy(MRgRT) for splenic irradiation (SI) in patients with myelofibrosis (MFI) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN).

Methods

This single-center retrospective analysis includes patients with MFI and MDS/MPN who underwent MRgRT SI between 2018 and 2022. Ten 1 Gy fractions were delivered to the planning target volume (spleen + 3/5mm margin). An adaptive online/offline strategy has been used to reduce the dose to healthy organs. Dosimetric data and clinical outcomes, including pain relief, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hematological values, were assessed.

Results

Twelve patients completed SI without interruption, with supportive transfusions as needed for cytopenias. Pain and gastrointestinal symptom relief was observed in most cases. The mean percentage reduction in spleen volume was 53.61%, with an average craniocaudal extension reduction of 77.78%. Twenty-nine (24.2%) of 120 fractions were online adapted, and 14 (11.7%) were replanned offline. Nonhematological toxicities were not reported. At a median follow-up of 12.9 months, 6 patients died, whereas 9 patients underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation, with 6 of them surviving.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates MRgRT SI feasibility in MFI and MDS/MPN patients, offering symptom relief and significant spleen volume reduction. Real-time setup verification and adaptive planning allowed for tailored treatment with reduced margins, minimizing healthy tissue exposure. Larger prospective studies with longer follow-ups are needed to further validate its efficacy and safety.

### Splenectomy for people with thalassaemia major or intermedia [^c42d9d4f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β-thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life-long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β-thalassaemia major or intermedia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018).Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled and quasi-randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio-frequency).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post-operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low-quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra-operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low-quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post-operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03).

Authors' Conclusions

The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well-conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^4630fbeb]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Hypersplenism, defined as chronic splenic enlargement with lowered hemoglobin concentration and decreased platelet and leukocyte counts, is the second major indication for splenectomy in SCD patients. – Splenectomy is usually indicated if there is hypersplenism, pressure effects of the spleen or failure to thrive. Transfusion is often ineffective in such children because of red blood cell sequestration in the enlarged spleen.

Although splenectomy is the treatment for recurrent acute splenic sequestration crises and hypersplenism in SCD, there is no evidence that it increases hemoglobin level, decreases hemolysis or improves patients’ survival.Splenectomy may, however, increase thromboembolism. Limited evidence is available about any possible increased incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension or pain frequency in SCD patients.

Laparoscopic splenectomy is generally used in children with SCD. It is performed after preoperative transfusion or exchange transfusion to decrease the percentage of HbS. The major limitations to using a laparoscopic approach in SCD children are the size of the spleen, with its local adhesions, and the longer duration of the operation. Although laparoscopic splenectomy has some positive aspects, such as the shorter duration of hospitalization, its impact on the incidence of post-operative severe, acute, SCD-related complications, including acute chest syndrome, is still unclear. To date there are no real advantages, in terms of hematologic phenotype and infective risk, from partial splenectomy rather than total splenectomy in children with SCD.

Thus, guidelines on the clinical management of acute splenic sequestration crisis in SCD are needed. The guidelines should present parameters for and timing of splenectomy, with accompanying surgical approaches. Indications are likely to vary depending on environmental factors, including the availability of safe blood transfusions and the spectrum of infections. Future multicenter studies should be designed to address these issues.

Splenectomy recommendations

- In SCD children, splenectomy is recommended after two acute splenic sequestration crises (agreed by 100% of experts) (grade 2 recommendation, grade C evidence).
- In SCD children, splenectomy is also recommended in patients with massive splenomegaly and/or hypersplenism (agreed by 90% of experts) (grade 2 recommendation, grade C evidence).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025—Treatment for higher-risk myelofibrosis—directs clinicians to assess blood counts and symptom burden using MPN-SAF TSS (MPN-E 1 of 2) if not done previously. For platelets <50 x 10^9/L, if not a transplant candidate or transplant not currently feasible, options are clinical trial or the preferred regimen Pacritinib (category 1) or the other recommended regimen Momelotinib (category 2B). For platelets ≥50 x 10^9/L with presence of symptomatic splenomegaly and/or constitutional symptoms, options are clinical trial or Ruxolitinib (category 1) or Fedratinib (category 1) or Momelotinib or Pacritinib (category 2B). After treatment initiation, with response, continue treatment and monitor for disease progression (MPN-E 1 of 2); with intolerance, no response, or loss of response, options include clinical trial or an alternate JAK inhibitor not used before (category 2B for pacritinib) and continue monitoring for disease progression (MPN-E 1 of 2). For disease progression, follow the accelerated/blast phase MPN pathway (MPN-AP/BP-1). Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Ruxolitinib and donor stem cell transplant for the treatment of... [^f37a67e2]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Ruxolitinib and Donor Stem Cell Transplant for the Treatment of Myelofibrosis Patients with Splenomegaly. This phase II trial tests how well ruxolitinib and donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with myelofibrosis and an enlarged spleen. Ruxolitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works to treat myelofibrosis by blocking the signals that cause cancer cells to multiply and has also been shown to shrink the spleen. Stem cell transplant is standard therapy for myelofibrosis, however, patients with splenomegaly are less likely to benefit from a stem cell transplant. An allogeneic stem cell transplant is when healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into a patient. The transplanted cells may help the patient's bone marrow make more healthy cells and platelets. Ruxolitinib before allogeneic stem cell transplant may be effective in treating myelofibrosis patients with splenomegaly. XIV.

Assess need for transfusions at 100 days. XV. Assess time to discontinuation of immunosuppressives. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess immune reconstitution. II. Assess cytokine profile. OUTLINE: .

Patients receive busulfan intravenously over 180 minutes on days -20, -13 and -6 to -3 and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3. Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant over 1-2 hours on day
0. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours, Mesna IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 4, and tacrolimus IV continuously and then PO twice daily, once tolerated, for up to 3 months. Patients may optionally receive eltrombopag PO QD or romiplostim injection weekly starting on day 5. Patients also undergo echocardiography and chest x-ray at baseline, abdominal ultrasound at baseline and follow up, and blood sample collection throughout the study.

Patients may optionally undergo bone marrow aspiration as clinically indicated.

### Ruxolitinib is effective in patients with intermediate-1 risk myelofibrosis: a summary of recent evidence [^a3d13996]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Of note, complete histopathologic and/or molecular remission has been observed in individual patients. Together, these findings suggest that ruxolitinib has the potential to alter the natural history of the disease in some patients. However, although ruxolitinib-treated patients in the COMFORT studies who had greater allele burden reductions tended to also have greater reductions in spleen size, allele burden reduction was not a prerequisite for clinical benefit. The potential of ruxolitinib to prolong survival needs to be taken into account when weighing ruxolitinib as a treatment option against the background of current dynamic risk models [Table 1] because these models were developed before the era of JAK inhibitors and may not accurately capture risk in patients on ruxolitinib therapy.

The observations detailed above strongly argue for timely initiation of therapy in patients with intermediate- or high-risk MF to maximize the potential long-term benefits of ruxolitinib therapy. However, patient selection for ruxolitinib therapy and timing of intervention should not be based only on nominal risk scores, but on a careful evaluation of the entire benefit–risk ratio. This evaluation should consider all known risk factors, including, but not limited to, age and mutation status, the degree of clinical burden from splenomegaly and symptoms, the expected hematologic toxicity of treatment in patients with preexisting cytopenias, and the likelihood of treatment success, which appears to diminish with the presence of multiple mutations. In those patients with intermediate-1 risk MF who are often in the proliferative phase of MF and have no clinically significant symptoms and no or only minor spleen enlargement, alternative treatments (eg, interferon-α) may be considered.

Age is an important prognostic factor that affects treatment decisions. For example, watchful waiting rather than starting ruxolitinib therapy is likely to be appropriate for patients who are older than 65 years but have no other known risk factors and no clinically significant symptoms. In contrast, patients aged < 65 years with intermediate-1 risk MF by IPSS should be considered as candidates for HCT if they have refractory anemia requiring transfusions, > 2% of peripheral blasts, or detrimental cytogenetics. Given the observation that median duration of spleen response in patients with intermediate- or high-risk MF has been estimated to be less than 4 years, the risk of losing response should also be considered before deciding on the initiation of ruxolitinib therapy in younger patients with intermediate-1 risk MF who may also qualify for HCT.

### Elective splenectomy for hematological diseases: a vanishing indication [^58e46360]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Splenectomy has long been a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of several hematological diseases and may be used as a therapeutic option in refractory cases to medical treatment. A diagnostic splenectomy may be required when there is a high suspicion of malignancy or when staging the disease. A splenectomy may also be indicated for palliative purposes in cases of induced hypersplenism or clinical discomfort secondary to massive splenomegaly.

The main drawback of conventional open splenectomy is its intrinsic complications, particularly the lifetime risk of overwhelming sepsis, portal vein thrombosis, or pulmonary hypertension. The introduction of the laparoscopic approach significantly reduced the surgical injury, thereby decreasing postoperative pain and the risk of infection, and enabling a faster recovery. Laparoscopy also relaunched interest in this surgical option, particularly for frail patients and patients with massive splenomegaly. However, simultaneously, over the 30 years since the introduction of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS), we have seen the introduction of novel medical therapies, new diagnostic imaging methods, biological markers, and better diagnostic protocols. Such changes have led to modifications in the guidelines and treatment recommendations of many hematological diseases for which splenectomy would have been an option.

Over these last 30 years, with an institutional series of over 500 cases, we have had a special interest in the evolution of the minimally invasive surgical approach to the spleen in our surgical unit, but in recent years we have observed a constant decrease in the annual number of new cases of hematological diseases referred for splenectomy. The current incidence of elective splenectomy for the treatment of hematological disease in an average surgical service is low, with only 6–10 cases performed yearly. The fading of surgical indications due to the advance of new medical therapies has not been an infrequent phenomenon in recent decades for some surgical treatments, such as peptic ulcer, portal hypertension, achalasia, bile duct stones, and the “watch and wait” option for rectal cancer.

This study aimed to examine the evidence of a reduction in the hematological indication for splenectomy and to evaluate the reasons and justification for this decrease.

### Efficacy and tolerability of Janus kinase inhibitors in myelofibrosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b8cbb827]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with constitutional symptoms, increasing splenomegaly, and worsening cytopenias. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been used for the treatment of myelofibrosis for several years, but there is a lack of comparative information between those treatments. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials in patients with myelofibrosis receiving JAK inhibitor or placebo or control. Primary outcomes were efficacy on spleen volume reduction and total symptom score reduction. Additional analyses were conducted on anemia and thrombopenia events. Seven studies were included in the network meta-analysis including 1953 patients randomly assigned to four JAK inhibitors—ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib, momelotinib—or control. In first-line therapy, momelotinib and fedratinib were associated with comparable efficacy to ruxolitinib, and with less toxicity on erythrocytes and platelets, respectively. Pacritinib was less effective on splenomegaly than ruxolitinib as a first-line treatment but seemed effective in second line, after ruxolitinib exposure. Fedratinib and ruxolitinib that are FDA approved in myelofibrosis have both confirmed being valuable option to treat splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, and their slightly different tolerance-profiles can guide therapeutic choice for first-line treatment, according to patient profile. Momelotinib could be another option especially due to its positive effect on anemia.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^164025b0]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Interferon

Despite in vitro data suggesting that interferon-α (IFN) could correct bone marrow fibrosis, in practice, the contribution of this drug to the treatment of MF has been minor, if any, owing to its limited efficacy and its frequent hematologic and extrahematologic toxicity, which leads to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients. Recently, promising results have been reported with the use of the pegylated form of IFN.However, the mid-term toxicity of pegylated IFN in other diseases is not negligible and its effects in the long run not yet known, especially considering the advanced age of most MF patients. It is, therefore, quite unlikely that pegylated IFN could have a relevant role in the therapy of MF.

### Splenic irradiation for myelofibrosis prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation: a global collaborative analysis [^03c68c55]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly is the clinical hallmark of myelofibrosis. Splenomegaly at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with graft failure and poor graft function. Strategies to reduce spleen size before HCT especially after failure to Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition represent unmet clinical needs in the field. Here, we leveraged a global collaboration to investigate the safety and efficacy of splenic irradiation as part of the HCT platform for patients with myelofibrosis. We included 59 patients, receiving irradiation within a median of 2weeks (range, 0.9-12weeks) before HCT. Overall, the median spleen size prior to irradiation was 23cm (range, 14-35). Splenic irradiation resulted in a significant and rapid spleen size reduction in 97% of patients (57/59), with a median decrease of 5.0cm (95% confidence interval, 4.1-6.3cm). The most frequent adverse event was thrombocytopenia, with no correlation between irradiation dose and hematological toxicities. The 3-year overall survival was 62% (95% CI, 48%-76%) and 1-year non-relapse mortality was 26% (95% CI, 14%-38%). Independent predictors for survival were severe thrombocytopenia and anemia before irradiation, transplant-specific risk score, higher-intensity conditioning, and present portal vein thrombosis. When using a propensity score matching adjusted for common confounders, splenic irradiation was associated with significantly reduced relapse (p=.01), showing a 3-year incidence of 12% for splenic irradiation versus 29% for patients with immediate HCT and 38% for patients receiving splenectomy. In conclusion, splenic irradiation immediately before HCT is a reasonable approach in patients experiencing JAK inhibition failure and is associated with a low incidence of relapse.

### How I treat myelofibrosis after failure of JAK inhibitors [^58f819a2]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

The introduction of JAK inhibitors, leading to regulatory approval of ruxolitinib, represents a major therapeutic advance in myelofibrosis (MF). Most patients experience reduction in splenomegaly and improved quality of life from symptom improvement. It is a paradox, however, that, despite inhibition of signaling downstream of disease-related driver mutations, JAK inhibitor treatment is not associated with consistent molecular or pathologic responses in MF. Furthermore, there are important limitations to JAK inhibitor therapy including development of dose-limiting cytopenias and/or nonhematological toxicities such as neuropathy or opportunistic infections. Over half of the patients discontinue treatment within 3 years of starting treatment. Although data are sparse, clinical outcome after JAK inhibitor "failure" is likely poor; consequently, it is important to understand patterns of failure to select appropriate salvage treatment(s). An algorithmic approach, particularly one that incorporates cytogenetics/molecular data, is most helpful in selecting stem cell transplant candidates. Treatment of transplant-ineligible patients relies on a problem-based approach that includes use of investigational drugs, or consideration of splenectomy or radiotherapy. Data from early phase ruxolitinib combination studies, despite promising preclinical data, have not shown clear benefit over monotherapy thus far. Development of effective treatment strategies for MF patients failing JAK inhibitors remains a major unmet need.

Since 2012, patients with MPN and clinically significant splenomegaly (>22 cm in the craniocaudal dimension) undergoing HCT at the Medical College of Wisconsin have received splenic irradiation immediately before starting the conditioning regimen with the goals of reducing splenic size and reducing the likelihood of posttransplant splenic sequestration. In the following sections, we report on the treatment technique, treatment side effects, and long-term outcomes for these patients.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1a8ff534]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Higher-risk myelofibrosis (MF) pre-transplant management—blast reduction, JAK inhibitor timing, and spleen control are outlined. For patients with >10% blasts in peripheral blood, azacitidine with or without a JAK inhibitor may be considered prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to reduce blasts. Several studies suggest that prior exposure to ruxolitinib may improve outcomes after allogeneic HCT. The guidelines recommend that JAK inhibitors should be considered for use for at least 2 months prior to transplant in patients with splenomegaly and/or constitutional symptoms, and JAK inhibitors can be tapered prior to or during conditioning to be completed before cell infusion. In massive splenomegaly unresponsive to JAK inhibitors, alternative measures such as splenic radiation, splenic artery embolization, or splenectomy may be considered prior to transplant.

### Momelotinib expands the therapeutic armamentarium for myelofibrosis: impact on hierarchy of treatment choices [^8565120e]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of treatment in myelofibrosis (MF) is prolongation of life, which is currently accomplished only by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Determination of optimal timing for AHSCT is facilitated by molecular risk stratification. Non-transplant treatment options in MF are palliative in scope and include Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors (JAKi): momelotinib (FDA approved on September 15, 2023), ruxolitinib (November 16, 2011), fedratinib (August 16, 2019), and pacritinib (February 28, 2022); all four JAKi are effective in reducing spleen size and alleviating symptoms, considered a drug class effect and attributed to their canonical JAK-STAT inhibitory mechanism of action. In addition, momelotinib exhibits erythropoietic effect, attributed to alleviation of ineffective erythropoiesis through inhibition of activin A receptor type-I (ACVR1). In transplant-ineligible or deferred patients, the order of treatment preference is based on specific symptoms and individual assessment of risk tolerance. Because of drug-induced immunosuppression and other toxicities attributed to JAKi, we prefer non-JAKi drugs as initial treatment for MF-associated anemia that is not accompanied by treatment-requiring splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms. Otherwise, it is reasonable to consider momelotinib as the first-line JAKi treatment of choice, in order to target the triad of quality-of-life offenders in MF: anemia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms/cachexia. For second-line therapy, we favor ruxolitinib, over fedratinib, based on toxicity profile. Pacritinib and fedratinib provide alternative options in the presence of severe thrombocytopenia or ruxolitinib-resistance/intolerance, respectively. Splenectomy remains a viable option for drug-resistant symptomatic splenomegaly and cytopenia.

### Philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms: critical concepts and management recommendations from European LeukemiaNet [^82a7db18]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

We present a review of critical concepts and produce recommendations on the management of Philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms, including monitoring, response definition, first- and second-line therapy, and therapy for special issues. Key questions were selected according the criterion of clinical relevance. Statements were produced using a Delphi process, and two consensus conferences involving a panel of 21 experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) were convened. Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) should be defined as high risk if age is greater than 60 years or there is a history of previous thrombosis. Risk stratification in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) should start with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for newly diagnosed patients and dynamic IPSS for patients being seen during their disease course, with the addition of cytogenetics evaluation and transfusion status. High-risk patients with PV should be managed with phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin, and cytoreduction, with either hydroxyurea or interferon at any age. High-risk patients with ET should be managed with cytoreduction, using hydroxyurea at any age. Monitoring response in PV and ET should use the ELN clinicohematologic criteria. Corticosteroids, androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and immunomodulators are recommended to treat anemia of PMF, whereas hydroxyurea is the first-line treatment of PMF-associated splenomegaly. Indications for splenectomy include symptomatic portal hypertension, drug-refractory painful splenomegaly, and frequent RBC transfusions. The risk of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation-related complications is justified in transplantation-eligible patients whose median survival time is expected to be less than 5 years.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^506471e5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive splenectomy (MIS) is increasingly favored for the treatment of benign and malignant diseases of the spleen over open access approaches. While many studies cite the superiority of MIS in terms of decreased morbidity and length of stay over a traditional open approach, the comparative effectiveness of specific technical and peri-operative approaches to MIS is unclear.

Objective

To develop evidence-based guidelines that support clinicians, patients, and others in decisions on the peri-operative performance of MIS.

Methods

A guidelines committee panel of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) including methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to grade the certainty of evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

Informed by a systematic review of the evidence, the panel agreed on eight recommendations for the peri-operative performance of MIS for adults and children in elective situations addressing six key questions.

Conclusions

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of lateral positioning for non-hematologic disease, intra-operative platelet administration for patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura instead of preoperative administration, and the use of mechanical devices to control the splenic hilum. Further, a conditional recommendation was made against routine intra-operative drain placement.

### JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib versus best available therapy for myelofibrosis [^e2ed197c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment options for myelofibrosis are limited. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a potent and selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, as compared with the best available therapy, in patients with myelofibrosis.

Methods

We assigned 219 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis to receive oral ruxolitinib or the best available therapy. The primary end point and key secondary end point of the study were the percentage of patients with at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume at week 48 and at week 24, respectively, as assessed with the use of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.

Results

A total of 28% of the patients in the ruxolitinib group had at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume at week 48, as compared with 0% in the group receiving the best available therapy (P<0.001); the corresponding percentages at week 24 were 32% and 0% (P<0.001). At 48 weeks, the mean palpable spleen length had decreased by 56% with ruxolitinib but had increased by 4% with the best available therapy. The median duration of response with ruxolitinib was not reached, with 80% of patients still having a response at a median follow-up of 12 months. Patients in the ruxolitinib group had an improvement in overall quality-of-life measures and a reduction in symptoms associated with myelofibrosis. The most common hematologic abnormalities of grade 3 or higher in either group were thrombocytopenia and anemia, which were managed with a dose reduction, interruption of treatment, or transfusion. One patient in each group discontinued treatment owing to thrombocytopenia, and none discontinued owing to anemia. Nonhematologic adverse events were rare and mostly grade 1 or 2. Two cases of acute myeloid leukemia were reported with the best available therapy.

Conclusions

Continuous ruxolitinib therapy, as compared with the best available therapy, was associated with marked and durable reductions in splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms, improvements in role functioning and quality of life, and modest toxic effects. An influence on overall survival has not yet been shown. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00934544.).

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^f80fe487]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Non-malignant haematological disease

Gaucher disease is associated with well-defined patterns of cytopenia. In spleen-intact patients, platelets tend to decrease first. With increasing spleen size, haemoglobin levels also gradually fall, followed lastly by a decline in leucocyte numbers. In contrast, asplenic patients have normal or even high platelet counts. If there is severe bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, haemoglobin levels often decline first. Deviations from these patterns may indicate other co-morbidities. For example, a non-splenectomized patient presenting with a large or slightly enlarged spleen, severe anaemia, but normal platelet counts is inconsistent with the expected pattern in Gaucher disease (which would normally include thrombocytopenia). In this case, it is likely that the anaemia is not (only) related to Gaucher disease and other causes should be investigated.

Anaemia

Anaemia is associated with poorer outcomes and poorer quality of life in a wide variety of disorders including Gaucher disease. Adoption of recent proposals to increase the lower limits defining anaemia for adults would enable earlier treatment and elevated treatment goals for haemoglobin normalization in adult Gaucher patients. Importantly, the proposals recognize that different ethnicities may have different requirements – an observation that may also be extended to different medical conditions and environments. Many Gaucher patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum present as children. Should anaemia in children, therefore, also be re-evaluated? In the absence of revised guidelines, an individualized approach to Gaucher disease management encourages physicians to assess, treat and monitor every patient individually for optimal outcomes. This takes into account variables, such as ethnic origin, age, environment, diet, co-morbidities and Gaucher disease status in all possible affected organs and tissues including bone marrow and bone density, in making disease management decisions.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^88d1d78a]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly. Symptomatic splenomegaly can be a significant issue in patients with pCMML. Clinical issues related to splenomegaly include early satiety, abdominal pain and tenderness, constitutional symptoms, referred shoulder pain, hiccoughs and mechanical obstruction of abdominal organs.Splenic infarction and spontaneous splenic rupture can result in abdominal catastrophes.I usually manage symptomatic splenomegaly, or massive splenomegaly, with cytoreductive therapy, with hydroxyurea being my first choice. There are recent encouraging data on the use of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with CMML, with 43% of CMML patients with baseline splenomegaly demonstrating a spleen response.Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with the two most common grade 3 and 4 treatment-related toxicities being anemia (10%) and thrombocytopenia (6%). I have used ruxolitinib off-label in select patients with good effect. DNMT inhibitors, splenic radiation and splenectomy are generally avoided, given inherent complications such as worsening cytopenias with DNMT inhibition, lack of durable responses with radiation and surgical morbidity/mortality associated with splenectomy.

Thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia in CMML has diverse etiologies including splenic sequestration from hypersplenism, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and bone marrow failure from progressive disease. Autoimmune phenomena, including immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, can be seen in 20-30% of CMML patients. While corticosteroids and rituximab have been used for patients with suspected immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, the use of thrombopoietin analogs, especially eltrombopag in CMML needs caution. There are reports of pCMML patients demonstrating worsening proliferative features, circulating blasts and bone marrow fibrosis on exposure to eltrombopag.The GFM however has completed a yet to be published phase II trial (NCT02323178) assessing the safety of eltrombopag in CMML patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50x10 9 /L). In this study eltrombopag was relatively well tolerated (median dose 150 mg; range, 100-300 mg), with 46.7% of patients achieving a platelet response (10 with dCMML and 4 with pCMML) that in general was not durable (median duration 3.4 months; range, 1.7-11.6 months). I use extreme caution when prescribing eltrombopag for pCMML patients with proliferative features. Other options for thrombocytopenia include splenectomy when immunemediated thrombocytopenia or splenic sequestration is suspected and DNMT inhibitors if the etiology is diseaserelated bone marrow dysfunction/failure.

### Ruxolitinib: the first FDA approved therapy for the treatment of myelofibrosis [^21cdc249]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

The BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis) are a group of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies that involve a clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. Thrombosis, bleeding, and transformation to acute leukemia reduce the overall survival of patients with myelofibrosis, a disease typified by progressive splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus, and bony pains. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant offers the only potential for cure in a minority of eligible patients, leaving a serious unmet need for improved therapies. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these diseases have led to an explosion of clinical trials evaluating novel therapies. The discovery of an activating mutation in the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) gene provided a therapeutic target to downregulate this activated signaling pathway, which influences the phenotype of these diseases. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi; Incyte) is a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1/2 that has proved to be effective at reducing splenomegaly and ameliorating symptoms in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Based on the results of 2 pivotal randomized phase III clinical trials, ruxolitinib has become the first therapeutic to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib offers a well-tolerated oral therapeutic option for patients with myelofibrosis with symptomatic splenomegaly and debilitating disease-related symptoms, but it does not seem to be effective at eliminating the underlying hematological malignancy.

### Pilot study of low-dose splenic irradiation and transplantation in JAK inhibitor-refractory myelofibrosis with splenomegaly [^7621cf30]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Splenomegaly is a hallmark feature of myelofibrosis, driven by extramedullary hematopoiesis due to progressive bone marrow fibrosis. Enlarged spleens cause significant symptoms, impair quality of life, and complicate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by increasing the risk of delayed engraftment, graft failure, and relapse. While Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can reduce spleen size, some patients remain refractory or lose response over time. Splenic irradiation has emerged as an alternative strategy, though optimal protocols and safety profiles remain unclear.

Objective

In this bicentric observational study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a standardized low-dose splenic irradiation protocol administered immediately prior to HSCT in patients with myelofibrosis and refractory splenomegaly.

Study Design

We included 11 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis who underwent first HSCT from 2020 to 2025. Patients received standardized low-dose splenic irradiation of 3.0 Gy fractionated into three or six daily sessions using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), administered either shortly before or partially concurrently with the conditioning regimen. We systematically monitored spleen size, hematologic parameters, molecular clearance of driver mutations, donor chimerism, and transplant-related outcomes.

Results

Median spleen size before irradiation was 25 cm, which significantly decreased to 22 cm post-irradiation (median reduction: 3 cm) and further reduced to 17.7 cm by engraftment (median additional reduction: 4.3 cm). All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment within a median of 12 days and platelet engraftment was achieved by 82% within 14 days. Isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurred transiently in 82% of patients without significant clinical consequences. No occurrences of veno-occlusive disease, thrombotic microangiopathy, or hemorrhagic complications were reported. At days 30 and 100 post-transplant, full donor chimerism was achieved in 91% and 80%, with driver mutation clearance observed in 70% and 80%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 5.5 months, overall survival was 91%, with two cases of early relapse and two instances of acute graft-versus-host disease. Two patients experienced poor graft function, one requiring stem cell boost.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that low-dose splenic irradiation prior to HSCT is an effective and safe adjunct treatment for managing splenomegaly in myelofibrosis patients. The standardized protocol resulted in substantial spleen size reduction, favorable engraftment kinetics, and acceptable toxicity profiles. These promising outcomes highlight splenic irradiation as a viable, less invasive alternative to splenectomy, warranting further exploration in larger prospective trials to refine protocols and confirm long-term benefits.

### Laparoscopic splenectomy: the clinical practice guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) [^93aa749d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has become the standard approach for most splenectomy cases, some areas still remain controversial. To date, the indications that preclude laparoscopic splenectomy are not clearly defined. In view of this, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) has developed clinical practice guidelines for LS.

Methods

An international expert panel was invited to appraise the current literature and to develop evidence-based recommendations. A consensus development conference using a nominal group process convened in May 2007. Its recommendations were presented at the annual EAES congress in Athens, Greece, on 5 July 2007 for discussion and further input. After a further Delphi process between the experts, the final recommendations were agreed upon.

Results

Laparoscopic splenectomy is indicated for most benign and malignant hematologic diseases independently of the patient's age and body weight. Preoperative investigation is recommended for obtaining information on spleen size and volume as well as the presence of accessory splenic tissue. Preoperative vaccination against meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type B infections is recommended in elective cases. Perioperative anticoagulant prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin should be administered to all patients and prolonged anticoagulant prophylaxis to high-risk patients. The choice of approach (supine [anterior], semilateral or lateral) is left to the surgeon's preference and concomitant conditions. In cases of massive splenomegaly, the hand-assisted technique should be considered to avoid conversion to open surgery and to reduce complication rates. The expert panel still considered portal hypertension and major medical comorbidities as contraindications to LS.

Conclusion

Despite a lack of level 1 evidence, LS is a safe and advantageous procedure in experienced hands that has displaced open surgery for almost all indications. To support the clinical evidence, further randomized controlled trials on different issues are mandatory.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^6097586e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The splenomegaly of MF

Splenomegaly, one of the most characteristic features of MF, is due to extramedullary hemopoiesis (also called myeloid metaplasia),which affects not only the spleen but also the liver (and, for this reason, hepatomegaly and alterations of the liver function often coexist) and, more unfrequently, other sites such as the lung, the kidney, the central nervous system, the lymph nodes or the skin. The spleen is palpable in up to 90% of MF patients at presentation.In this sense, it must be noted that if the spleen is not palpable at diagnosis and does not become palpable after 1 or 2 years, the possibility of other conditions such as myelodysplasia, which can also cause cytopenias and marrow fibrosis, should be excluded by careful examination of the bone marrow histopathologic features.Symptoms from splenomegaly usually correlate with spleen size. Thus, some patients with moderate splenomegaly may not have local symptoms initially. However, as the spleen progressively increases, it produces mechanical discomfort in the left part of the abdomen, occasionally episodes of severe pain in the left upper quadrant irradiating to the shoulder and due to splenic infarctions, early saciety and diarrhea. These symptoms are frequently associated with profound cachexia and fatigue, accentuation of pre-existing cytopenias and, sometimes, signs of portal hypertension. Of note, despite its clinical relevance in MF, splenomegaly is not per se a poor prognostic factor of the disease, as it is usually observed in patients displaying other well-recognized unfavorable prognostic factors, such as severe anemia, constitutional symptoms or marked leukocytosis.

### Definition and management of ruxolitinib treatment failure in myelofibrosis [^afacdcb6]. Blood Cancer Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical scenarios illustrating failure of first-line ruxolitinib treatment and our proposed management options for each scenario

1. Early-onset cytopenias: treatment-related myelosuppression

Generally seen within the first 12 weeks of treatment.
Dose dependent to a large extent.
Lower baseline blood counts predispose to more severe treatment-emergent cytopenias.
Generally reversible with dose reduction or treatment interruption.

Management options:

Support with red blood cell/platelet transfusions as necessary.
Decrease dose or interrupt treatment depending upon severity of cytopenias. Treatment with a lower dose can be resumed after blood count recovery.
If a minimum efficacious dose of ruxolitinib cannot be maintained, then consider an alternative treatment modality, including participation in clinical trials. In this regard, one could consider momelotinib or pacritinib for dose-limiting anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively (studies NCT02101268 and NCT02055781).
Consider splenectomy especially if severe symptoms related to splenomegaly and patient is a surgical candidate.
The safety and efficacy of adding other drugs to ruxolitinib remains to be determined. Potential options include the addition of erythropoiesis stimulating agents or danazol (NCT01732445) for anemia and an immunomodulatory drug for thrombocytopenia.

2. Late-onset cytopenias: generally reflects disease progression

Develops after 6–12 months of treatment at a stable dose.
May occur in the absence of disease progression—consider drug–drug interaction that may increase exposure to ruxolitinib (for example, concurrent voriconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) treatment).
Cytogenetic or molecular studies may confirm clonal evolution.
Generally irreversible; may not respond to dose reduction or treatment interruption.

Management options:

Discontinue offending drug in case of interaction with ruxolitinib.
Exclude cumulative toxicity: if feasible, hold ruxolitinib and await blood count recovery over days to weeks.
Generally do not favor alternative JAK inhibitor if clonal evolution documented given the absence of selective anti-clonal activity for this drug class.
Consider ASCT if patient is a candidate for such and a donor available.
If not a transplant candidate, then splenectomy especially if severe symptoms related to splenomegaly and patient is a surgical candidate. Alternative measures include participation in clinical trials although persistent cytopenias may limit study eligibility.
Consider adding another drug (see management of Scenario #1[e]).

### Momelotinib (JAK1 / JAK2 / ACVR1 inhibitor): mechanism of action, clinical trial reports, and therapeutic prospects beyond myelofibrosis [^8e34c1cb]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Momelotinib-inclusive treatment algorithm and concluding remarks

ASCT currently remains the only treatment option in MF that can secure long-term survival. The number of allogeneic transplants in MF has increased in recent years and it is encouraging to witness, over time, a higher number of patients who are older and less fit but are transplanted, increased utilization of matched unrelated donors, improvements in overall and relapse-free survival, decreased incidence of graft- versus -host disease and stable incidence of non-relapse mortality.In transplant-ineligible patients, optimal palliative care requires attention to all three quality-of-life offenders: anemia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms.In this regard, because of its salutary effect on anemia, as well as splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, momelotinib might have an edge over currently FDA-approved JAK inhibitors. However, scientifically sound comparisons between different JAK inhibitors can only be accomplished through prospective controlled studies and should also consider other factors, including side effects (Table 2). Emerging information suggests similar erythropoietic benefit from pacritinib but it is not certain whether its activity against splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms would be as potent as that of momelotinib.

Currently available JAK inhibitors, including momelotinib, are inherently immunosuppressive and carry multiple side effects that necessitate due diligence in their use (Table 2). Current indications for JAK inhibitor therapy in MF include hydroxyurea-refractory splenomegaly and severe constitutional symptoms. The availability of momelotinib in the near future might expand the list of indications to include anemia. However, in the absence of symptomatic splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms, we prefer initial therapy with non-JAK inhibitor drugs (Figure 2). Similarly, we prefer initial treatment with hydroxyurea, for the treatment of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, or extreme thrombocytosis, in the absence of associated anemia or severe constitutional symptoms (Figure 2); such an approach considers the superior activity of hydroxyurea, compared to JAK inhibitors, in terms of controlling leukocytosis and thrombocytosis as well as the fact that the spleen effect of ruxolitinib or other JAK inhibitors is often not durable and the value of these inhibitors might be best reserved for those patients in whom treatment with hydroxyurea fails. Our second-line drug of choice in the latter instance is ruxolitinib, considering its comparatively better toxicity profile, compared to that of other JAK inhibitors (Table 2).

### Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly: long-term results and risks for mortality [^d6d09fac]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate long-term outcomes after splenectomy for massive splenomegaly in a series of 222 consecutive patients.

Background

Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (>1500 g) provides palliation but is associated with a high rate of perioperative complications in a population of patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Predictive factors for survival and whether the palliative goals are achieved in the long-term are not well defined.

Methods

Patients with various hematological disorders who underwent splenectomy between 1998 and 2009 were followed until death or for at least 2 years. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to ascertain the impact of demographical factors, diagnoses, and preoperative transfusion parameters on the postoperative survival.

Results

Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly was performed most commonly for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (48%) and myeloid metaplasia (31%). Mean ± standard deviation splenic weight was 2731 ± 1393 g (range, 1500-13,085 g). Average operating time was 115 minutes, with a range from 46 to 346 minutes. Thirty-day mortality was 1.8%, and the complication rate was 20%. The most common complications were hemorrhage (9%) and portal venous thrombosis (9.9%). Relief from pressure-related symptoms was achieved in 98.5%, and durable remission of anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted in half of the patients at 2 years. Sex, age, and intraoperative blood loss were not significantly associated with survival. Preoperative need for red blood cell and platelet transfusions were the most significant risk factors associated with decreased survival.

Conclusions

Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly can be performed safely and offers durable palliation. Preoperative transfusion requirement is an indicator of hematological disease severity and predictor of decreased survival.

### Management of myelofibrosis after ruxolitinib failure [^64c74bd0]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, the Janus kinase1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib has emerged as a cornerstone of myelofibrosis (MF) management. Ruxolitinib improves splenomegaly and symptoms regardless of driver mutation status, and confers a survival advantage in patients with intermediate-2/high risk MF. However, cytopenias remain problematic, and evidence for a robust anti-clonal effect is lacking. Furthermore, the median duration of spleen response to ruxolitinib in clinical trials is approximately 3years, and ruxolitinib does not appear to affect the risk of leukemic transformation. There is no therapy approved specifically for patients whose disease 'progresses' on ruxolitinib, defining which remains challenging. The recent regulatory approval of the JAK2 inihibitor fedratinib partially fulfills this unmet need, but much remains to be done. Other JAK inhibitors and a plethora of novel agents are being studied in the ruxolitinib 'failure' setting, as well as 'add-on' therapies to ruxolitinib in patients having a 'sub-optimal' response.

### Risks and benefits of splenectomy versus no splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis – a personal view [^63e7dbc7]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is indicated in hereditary spherocytosis to relieve symptoms due to anaemia or splenomegaly, reverse growth failure or skeletal changes due to over-robust erythropoiesis, and prevent recurrent gallstones. A life-long risk of bacterial infection has been recognised for many years as a concomitant cost of splenectomy. The scope of this risk has expanded to include a number of organisms beyond the triad of pneumococcus, meningococcus, and haemophilus influenzae. Recently, it has been demonstrated that splenectomy also confers a significant risk of delayed adverse vascular events in patients with hereditary spherocytosis, just as it does in patients undergoing splenectomy for other indications. Further, these same studies demonstrated a benefit of avoiding splenectomy: hereditary spherocytosis patients with a spleen have significantly fewer adverse vascular events than unaffected family members, probably because of the protective effect of chronic, mild anaemia. Accordingly, this review marshals the evidence favouring a conservative approach to splenectomy in spherocytosis.

DISCUSSION

This investigation adds to CDC’s previously published descriptive results of splenomegaly in individuals following departure from a tropical and malaria-endemic area. Persistent splenomegaly, defined as persistence beyond 6 months after arrival, was present in more than half of case-patients with available records; and chronic splenomegaly, defined as persistence beyond 18 months, occurred in about a third of patients with available follow-up records. Splenomegaly failed to resolve in many of the case-patients, despite previous literature suggesting the condition would improve in a vast majority of patients within the observed time frame of this investigation. These findings indicate that in certain populations, splenomegaly and associated morbidities will persist in a substantial proportion of individuals.

Despite previous treatment recommendations for malaria,, only 36.9% of all case patients received primaquine after arrival to treat liver-stage hypnozoites; however, 60.9% of refugees with persistent splenomegaly received primaquine at some point during the follow-up, suggesting that it was more often considered for clinically complicated cases. Contributors to inconsistent primaquine administration may include the need for repeated visits for G6PD testing, a long (14-day) course, availability of primaquine, and lack of awareness among domestic physicians of CDC’s recommendation. Although inadequate treatment for malaria is not the sole contributor to splenomegaly persistence in this population, CDC has recommended that primaquine be prescribed to all refugees with splenomegaly arriving from a malaria-endemic region who are G6PD-negative, and clinical progression should be closely followed after treatment administration.

### The evolving treatment paradigm in myelofibrosis [^78ad2434]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2013). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is a palliative measure used for debulking in patients with MPNs. Splenectomy improves splenomegaly-related symptoms (early satiety, splenic infarcts and splenic exacerbation of cytopenias), but has no clear effect on survival or disease course. Splenectomy is associated with increased risk of several complications; one study of 314 patients reported fatal complications in 6.7% of patients undergoing the surgery. When performed prior to allogeneic transplant, splenectomy may facilitate disease eradication. Some reports have also shown faster engraftment in splenectomized patients; however, the use of splenectomy prior to transplant remains controversial. Given the high complication rate and limited benefit of splenectomy, appropriate patient selection is crucial.

Splenic radiotherapy can be used to treat MPNs, as extramedullary hematopoiesis has demonstrated considerable sensitivity to external beam radiotherapy in patients with MF. However, splenic radiotherapy demonstrates transient benefit in patients with MPNs and may exacerbate cytopenias, particularly thrombocytopenia. A perioperative mortality rate of 11% was reported in a series of patients treated with splenic irradiation followed by splenectomy, indicating that irradiation may complicate future splenectomy if attempted. Overall, traditional treatment options are limited and inadequate to address the morbidity and mortality associated with MF. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed.

Janus kinase 2 mutations and MF

The discovery of a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gain-of-function mutation, JAK2V617F, has led to significant improvements in the understanding of the biology underlying MPNs, as well as the development of ruxolitinib, a JAK2 inhibitor and the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of MF. The JAK2 inhibitors SAR302503 (TG101348), CYT387 and pacritinib (SB1518) show promise in the treatment of patients with MPNs and are currently in clinical development (Table I). While all of these compounds inhibit JAK2 by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the ATP-binding catalytic site in the kinase domain, there are significant differences in their inhibition of other JAK family kinases, which may influence efficacy and AE profiles. Familiarity with their pharmacologic properties and clinical effects will be critical in the management of MF as these agents become approved for use.

### Contemporary risk stratification and treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^1216b7cd]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by absolute monocytosis, one or more lineage dysplasia, and proliferative features including myeloid hyperplasia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Because of vast clinical heterogeneity in presentation and course, risk stratification is used for a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Numerous prognostic scoring systems exist, some of which incorporate mutational information. Treatment ranges from observation to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therapies include hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, hypomethylating agents, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to address splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Recently, oral decitabine with cedazuridine was approved and represents a convenient treatment option for CMML patients. Although novel therapeutics are in development for CMML, further work is needed to elucidate possible targets unique to the CMML clone. In this review, we will detail the pathophysiology, risk stratification, available treatment modalities, and novel therapies for CMML, and propose a modern treatment algorithm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clinically heterogenous disease, which poses significant management challenges. The diagnosis of CMML requires bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with thorough evaluation. Risk stratification and symptom assessment are essential to designing an effective treatment plan, which may include hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in intermediate or high-risk patients. The recently approved oral decitabine/cedazuridine provides a convenient alternative to parenteral HMAs. Ruxolitinib may be effective in ameliorating proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative potential; however, novel therapies are in clinical development which may significantly alter the therapeutic landscape of CMML.

### Fedratinib in 2025 and beyond: indications and future applications [^faf161be]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

One should consider making the transition to fedratinib before the disease progresses fully and is refractory to any JAKi option. Therefore, when the physician first notes loss of original spleen response or after at least 3 months of maximal ruxolitinib dosing without response, a sooner rather than delayed transition in therapy should be executed.

It is also important to recognize that clinical trial evaluation of second-line therapies frequently require a “wash-out” period of ≥2 weeks to fully assess SVR. In the real-world setting with commercial fedratinib, this is both unnecessary and potentially detrimental to a smooth transition. We advise making the switch immediately from ruxolitinib to fedratinib and always administering it at the intended full dose of 400 mg once daily. In patients who are taking ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg twice daily or higher, tapering by 5 mg twice daily every 4 to 7 days and briefly overlapping with fedratinib may help mitigate the risk of JAKi withdrawal syndrome. We do not routinely advise the use of prophylactic steroids, but their administration and reintroduction of ruxolitinib can be considered if signs or symptoms (fever, increased splenomegaly, and hemodynamic instability) of JAKi withdrawal occur. Although in vitro studies demonstrate the potential for fedratinib discontinuation to provoke JAKi withdrawal syndrome, we do not routinely recommend a taper when stopping, given the low likelihood and lack of reported cases.As the trials demonstrate, the expected myelosuppression may warrant transfusional support in the first several months, and a careful monitoring of the patients through laboratory assessments is important to navigate early fedratinib treatment.

Recommendation 12

Risk assessment should evaluate disease severity and activity at baseline and on treatment. We recommend a combination of serum liver tests (to identify those with an elevated bilirubin, a platelet count <150 or biochemical disease activity on treatment), imaging (liver ultrasound to identify overt cirrhosis and splenomegaly; TE to identify increased liver stiffness) and recognition of young age at disease onset (<45 years) and male sex. These can all aid risk stratification for patients with PBC. (Strong; Moderate)

### Magnetic resonance imaging guided radiation therapy for splenomegaly: clinical experiences and technical tips [^a69ba040]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptomatic splenomegaly is a condition frequently found in many chronic lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. One of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPN) often associated with splenomegaly is myelofibrosis (MFI), a rare disease occurring more often in the elderly population. This condition, which may develop as primary (pMFI) or secondary MFI (sMFI), as an evolution of other CMPNs such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and cytopenias.

Ineffective hemopoiesis and reactive bone marrow fibrosis led to the activation of extramedullary hemopoiesis, mainly originating from the spleen. This process is at the basis of splenomegaly, which sometimes leads to increased cytopenias due to the sequestration and progressive destruction of blood cells.Extremely rarely, splenomegaly is also seen in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), characterized by hypercellular bone marrow and peripheral cytopenia due to intramedullary apoptosis of dysplastic clonal cells.In this setting, the pathogenesis of splenomegaly is not entirely understood, but the underlying mechanism is most likely a consequence of the MDS pathogenetic processes described above. Specifically, this nosologic entity is better known as myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN).

Symptoms of splenomegaly are related to the gradual growth of the spleen and include pain, both due to congestion in the abdominal cavity and the onset of splenic infarcts, premature satiety, challenged ingestion, gastric compression, asthenia, and cachexia.Splenectomy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic splenomegaly unresponsive to therapy, although it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the high risk of bleeding, infection, and thrombosis.

Historically, radiation therapy (RT) has always been reserved in a palliative or salvage setting, in patients unfit for surgery, due to poor performance status or advanced age, or unresponsive to medical therapies.Given the paucity of data in the literature, several studies reported benefits in terms of pain relief, symptom, and cytopenia improvement, as well as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which is the only definitive treatment option for these patients.Low doses of RT are effectively prescribed for the treatment of splenomegaly. Indeed, the responses in spleen size reduction, pain, and blood count benefit are very fast, without significant toxicity.

### Therapeutic potential of Janus-activated kinase-2 inhibitors for the management of myelofibrosis [^6a456efc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis (either primary or postpolycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia) is a chronic and debilitating myeloproliferative neoplasm for which there is no well-accepted standard of care. Clinical manifestations of this disease (e.g., cytopenias, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis) and constitutional symptoms (e.g., hypercatabolic state, fatigue, night sweats, fever) create significant treatment challenges. For example, progressive splenomegaly increases the risk for more serious clinical sequelae (e.g., portal hypertension, splenic infarction). Myelofibrosis arises from hematopoietic stem cells or early progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and clinical presentation are poorly understood, delaying the development of effective and targeted treatments. Recent studies have implicated mutations that directly or indirectly lead to the deregulated activation of Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2). Appreciation for the activation of JAK2 and the importance of increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of myelofibrosis has led to novel therapeutic agents targeting JAKs. This review will briefly discuss the origins of the JAK2 hypothesis, the clinical relevance of JAK2 mutations in myelofibrosis, and recent clinical progress in targeting JAKs as a therapeutic intervention for patients with this chronic and debilitating disease.

### Recommendations for clinical monitoring of patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) [^ea869343]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for liver disease are limited. Patients with liver disease should refrain from alcohol use. Symptom management in patients with end-stage liver disease should focus on screening for liver lesions, control of edema and ascites, prevention of bleeding due to esophageal varices with non-selective beta blockers with or without endoscopic variceal ligation according to hepatology guidelines, prevention/management of hepatic encephalopathy, vaccinations, prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as appropriate, and nutritional maintenance. Liver transplantation has been performed in several ASMD patients (, MW personal communication), and decisions to transplant will be driven by the degree of complications resulting from cirrhosis.

3.4. Splenomegaly

The most common initial clinical presentation for patients with chronic ASMD is organomegaly in early childhood, although in mild disease splenomegaly may not be obvious. Almost every patient described in observational studies of patients with chronic ASMD harbor splenomegaly [,–]. Splenomegaly is initially caused by infiltration of lipid-laden macrophages, but more rapid progression of splenomegaly should raise concerns about contributing effects of portal hypertension. Splenomegaly is significant and can be massive reaching spleen volumes > 20 multiples of normal, leading to hypersplenism with increased risks for bleeding and splenic rupture, especially in the context of falling platelet counts.

There are no satisfactory treatment options for splenomegaly. Splenectomy is generally contraindicated due to the potential for exacerbation of liver disease and increased sphingomyelin accumulation in the lungs with progressive respiratory insufficiency (authors’ clinical experience). If splenectomy needs to be considered due to massive splenomegaly, pressure symptoms, and severe unsustainable hypersplenism, then partial splenectomy or partial splenic arterial embolization are potential options, which have been used in Gaucher disease. If emergency surgery is necessary because of splenic trauma, necrosis, or rupture, partial or total splenectomy should be performed according to surgical indications with use of standard post-surgical antibiotic prophylaxes and vaccinations. Lifestyle modifications include reduction and caution in contact sports to minimize trauma to the spleen.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^538b8d02]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemolytic anemias are a group of disorders with a variety of causes, including red cell membrane defects, red blood cell enzyme disorders, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, thalassemia syndromes and hemoglobinopathies. As damaged red blood cells passing through the red pulp of the spleen are removed by splenic macrophages, splenectomy is one possible therapeutic approach to the management of severely affected patients. However, except for hereditary spherocytosis for which the effectiveness of splenectomy has been well documented, the efficacy of splenectomy in other anemias within this group has yet to be determined and there are concerns regarding short- and long-term infectious and thrombotic complications. In light of the priorities identified by the European Hematology Association Roadmap we generated specific recommendations for each disorder, except thalassemia syndromes for which there are other, recent guidelines. Our recommendations are intended to enable clinicians to achieve better informed decisions on disease management by splenectomy, on the type of splenectomy and the possible consequences. As no randomized clinical trials, case control or cohort studies regarding splenectomy in these disorders were found in the literature, recommendations for each disease were based on expert opinion and were subsequently critically revised and modified by the Splenectomy in Rare Anemias Study Group, which includes hematologists caring for both adults and children.

### Prevalence of malaria parasite infections among U.S.-Bound Congolese refugees with and without splenomegaly [^0e7a7afc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite these recommendations, many refugees had persistent splenomegaly months to years after arrival in the United States.In addition, there were increasing reports of breakthrough malaria, particularly Plasmodium malariae despite predeparture treatment with AL,which was of concern because of increasing reports of AL treatment failure for P. malariae infections.Because P. malariae has been well associated with splenomegaly, – the reports of P. malariae in Congolese refugees raised additional concern that the documented persistent splenomegaly could be related to inadequate malaria presumptive treatment, especially if baseline prevalence of P. malariae infection was higher than expected.

In response to these concerns, and given the continuing high burden of malaria in U.S.-bound Congolese refugees from Uganda, the CDC expanded its guidance for malaria testing and treatment in 2018 to include the RDT for P. falciparum for all Congolese refugees (with or without splenomegaly) plus PCR. Refugees with a positive RDT and those diagnosed with splenomegaly (with or without a positive RDT) were treated with AL at the initial examination (approximately 6 months before departure).In addition, when PCR results became available (at a later date), refugees with positive results who had not previously received appropriate treatment based on species, or had a newly identified infection, were offered treatment.It should be noted that in addition to enhanced diagnostics and treatment at initial medical evaluation, all refugees without a contraindication (including those who received previous treatment based on a positive RDT, positive PCR, or diagnosis of splenomegaly) received AL treatment completed no sooner than 5 days before departure for the United States, consistent with previous guidance.An outline of this guidance is provided in Table 1.

This case study illustrates the potential indication of selective internal radiotherapy in a heavily pretreated patient with highly refractory disease with a marginal zone lymphoma in leukemic phase and symptomatic splenomegaly. We describe the clinical course of disease; the biological and clinical response to the treatment after radioembolization; and simulation and dosimetry by multimodal imaging via single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography. The advantages of radioembolization for the management of lymphomatous splenomegaly are discussed.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^b866ffce]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Splenectomy

Splenectomy involves a substantial risk in patients with MF. In a single-institution series, operative morbidity was 31% and mortality 9%, usually during the 3-month post-splenectomy period.Main complications are bleeding (especially hemoperitoneum), infections and thrombosis. In addition, massive hepatomegaly due to compensatory myeloid metaplasia of the liver develops in 16–24% of patients, some of which die from liver failure.Post-splenectomy thrombocytosis that increases the risk of thrombosis, especially in the splenoportal vein tract,is observed in 20% of patients. Following splenectomy, a higher rate of blast transformation has also been registered in one study,although this was not confirmed by others.

Splenectomy can be considered in MF patients with heavily symptomatic splenomegaly refractory to drug treatment, severe constitutional symptoms, transfusion-dependent anemia (including uncontrollable hemolysis) unresponsive to therapy and portal hypertension secondary to the increased portal flow.As no survival prolongation from splenectomy has been demonstrated, the risks of splenectomy should be carefully balanced against the possible benefits in every individual patient, in order to restrict the procedure to those patients most likely to benefit from it. Given the risks associated with the procedure, other factors such as the patient's comorbidities and life expectancy must also be taken into account.

### Comparative effectiveness of different types of splenectomy for children with congenital hemolytic anemias [^f31625ef]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of different types of splenectomy in children with congenital hemolytic anemias.

Study Design

We constructed key questions that addressed outcomes relevant to clinicians and families on effects of partial or total splenectomy, including hematologic effect, splenic function, and the risk of adverse events. We identified from Pubmed and Embase 703 studies that evaluated different types of splenectomy and accepted 93 studies that satisfied entry criteria. We graded the quality of each report and summarized the overall strength of research evidence for each key question.

Results

We did not identify any randomized clinical trials. All types of splenectomy have favorable clinical outcomes in most diseases. We did not identify any hematologic advantage of laparoscopy compared with laparotomy. Adverse events are uncommon in most studies and are minimized with use of laparoscopy.

Conclusions

There is a need for randomized clinical trials and improved data collection of different types of splenectomy in congenital hemolytic anemias. Outcomes studied should address the concerns of families and clinicians to assess the risks and benefits of various treatments.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees-multiple States, 2015-2018 [^91b1df26]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In 2014, panel physicians from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), who conduct Department of State-required predeparture examinations for U.S.-bound refugees at resettlement sites in Uganda, noticed an unusually high number of Congolese refugees with enlarged spleens, or splenomegaly. Many conditions can cause splenomegaly, such as various infections, liver disease, and cancer. Splenomegaly can result in hematologic disturbances and abdominal pain and can increase the risk for splenic rupture from blunt trauma, resulting in life-threatening internal bleeding. On CDC's advice, panel physicians implemented an enhanced surveillance and treatment protocol that included screening for malaria (through thick and thin smears and rapid diagnostic testing), schistosomiasis, and several other conditions; treatment of any condition identified as potentially associated with splenomegaly; and empiric treatment for the most likely etiologies, including malaria and schistosomiasis. CDC recommended further treatment for malaria with primaquine after arrival, after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing, to target liver-stage parasites. Despite this recommended treatment protocol, 35 of 64 patients with available follow-up records had splenomegaly that persisted beyond 6 months after resettlement. Among 85 patients who were diagnosed with splenomegaly through abdominal palpation or ultrasound at any point after resettlement, 53 had some hematologic abnormality (leukopenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia), 16 had evidence of current or recent malaria infection, and eight had evidence of schistosomiasis. Even though primaquine was provided to a minority of patients in this cohort, it should be provided to all eligible patients with persistent splenomegaly, and repeated antischistosomal therapy should be provided to patients with evidence of current or recent schistosomiasis. Given substantial evidence of familial clustering of cases, family members of patients with known splenomegaly should be proactively screened for this condition.

### Palliative splenectomy in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia [^6bad7d13]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2001). Low credibility.

Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder in which the accumulation and growth of circulating myeloid progenitors in the spleen lead to pathologic enlargement of the organ with resulting mechanical discomfort, hypercatabolic symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and portal hypertension. Medical therapy and splenic irradiation may be of benefit in certain patients, yet many may still require splenectomy to palliate their symptoms. Although there is no clear survival advantage to splenectomy in MMM, the procedure can result in substantial palliation of symptoms. However, the surgical procedure is associated with an approximately 9% mortality rate, and the postsplenectomy occurrence of extreme thrombocytosis, hepatomegaly, and leukemic transformation is of major concern. The management of splenomegaly and the role of splenectomy in MMM are discussed in this review.

### A phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study of the JAK2 inhibitor NS-018 in patients with myelofibrosis [^5a0185b4]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Similar to other JAK2 inhibitors, clinical activity of NS-018 included reduction of splenomegaly and improvement of MF-associated constitutional symptoms. Overall, more than half of the splenic-evaluable patients achieved ⩾50% reduction in spleen size and almost a third attained a 100% reduction by physical examination. Improvement in splenomegaly was observed irrespective of JAK2 V617F mutational status, as has been reported for other JAK inhibitors (for example, fedratinib,ruxolitinib). NS-018 was able to elicit durable responses, with clinical improvement (response maintained for at least 8 weeks) in splenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia. A reduction in symptom burden was observed for each of the 8 symptoms measured, with complete resolution (100% reduction) observed in some patients. Symptom improvement (⩾50% reduction in score) was observed after 4 weeks of treatment—the earliest evaluable time—and the proportion of evaluable patients with this level of improvement was maintained or increased at Week 12 for most symptoms, again indicating the durability of response. The efficacy of NS-018 300 mg QD during prolonged follow-up is under investigation in the phase II portion of the study.

### Efficacy of ruxolitinib on hepatomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^f1d61e2b]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

The results of this exploratory analysis from COMFORT-I, a placebo-controlled study with a large study population, provide evidence suggesting that ruxolitinib is effective in providing rapid and sustained reduction in MF-related hepatomegaly. This has not been objectively demonstrated to date with other medical therapies. Overall, patients achieved most of their treatment benefit regarding the magnitude of liver volume reductions after ~48 weeks of treatment. By comparison, the time frame for maximal mean spleen volume responses in the COMFORT studies was ~24 weeks. Percentage reductions in liver volume were largely independent of the liver volume at baseline. Improvement in hepatomegaly was associated with previously reported improvements in splenomegaly, weight gain and increases in albumin and leptin,, raising the possibility of shared underlying mechanisms. The correlation between liver volume reductions and increases in albumin levels is notable, as albumin is a measure of the biosynthetic function of the liver.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^726b2a30]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In the series of the Mayo Clinic, durable responses in constitutional symptoms, transfusion-dependent anemia, portal hypertension and severe thrombocytopenia were obtained in 67%, 23%, 50% and 0% of cases, respectively.From the above results, it can be inferred that splenectomy has no role in the treatment of the thrombocytopenia of MF. Beside, thrombocytosis would be a relative contraindication to splenectomy, given the high probability of provoking uncontrollable thrombocytosis and thrombosis, especially in the splenoportal vein tract, because of the additional effect of the local injury during the surgical procedure. Therefore, if platelets are above the normal range and, despite this, splenectomy is decided, it is advisable to lower the platelets with hydroxyurea before surgery to around 200 × 10 9 /l and to maintain them at this level in the post-operative period to reduce the risk of thrombosis.In addition, once it is made sure that peritoneal bleeding has not occurred within the first 24 h post surgery, prophylactic anticoagulation with low-weight molecular heparin should be instituted and maintained for at least 4–6 weeks. Peritoneal bleeding, the most life-threatening complication of splenectomy in these patients, usually occurs during the first 24 h following surgery. This complication can be related to the presence of thrombocytopenia but also to the existence of abnormalities of the platelet function in these patients. Because of this, I usually transfuse platelet concentrates immediately after spleen removal in all patients with platelet counts <150 × 10 9 /l. I also do it in patients who actually develop peritoneal bleeding, in conjunction with the surgical measures aimed at stopping bleeding. By applying this measure, the incidence of this complication has dramatically dropped in my center and no mortality from this origin has been further observed. However, this personal approach is not supported by any randomized study.

With regard to the question of splenectomy or no before allo-HSCT, given the morbidity and mortality of splenectomy versus the faster hematologic recovery post transplant,splenectomy preceding transplantation is controversial. Although the current tendency is not to perform splenectomy routinely as preparation for transplantation,it seems reasonable to carry out the procedure in patients with massive splenomegaly, taking into account the higher risk of graft failure in such cases. However, this scenario will probably change with the availability of the JAK2 inhibitors, which are highly effective in reducing the splenomegaly in a high proportion of MF patients.

### How I treat splenomegaly in myelofibrosis [^91dc882d]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

TG101348 is an inhibitor with preferential activity in JAK2. In a phase 1/2 study with 59 patients,dose-limiting toxicity was an increase in the serum amylases, without clinical signs of pancreatitis. Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequent but usually moderate and transient. Worsening of anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 35%, 24% and 10% of the patients, respectively. At 6 months of treatment, almost 60% achieved a >50% decrease in splenomegaly. The responses were independent of the JAK2 V617F mutational status, but a >50% decrease in the allele burden was reported in 40% of mutated patients. Symptomatic response was achieved in 50–75% and, as opposed to ruxolitinib, improvement in constitutional symptoms did not correlate with changes in pro-inflammatory plasma cytokine levels.

CEP-701 achieved clinical improvement in 6 of 22 MF patients.However, gastrointestinal toxicity was remarkable, with diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in 72%, 50%, and 27%, respectively. No effect on JAK2 V617F allele burden or pro-inflammatory cytokines was documented.

In a phase 1/2 study with 108 MF patients,CYT387 produced a response in palpable spleen according to the IWG-MRT criteria in 45% of cases, whereas resolution of constitutional symptoms was observed in the majority of patients. Of note, of the 42 patients evaluable for anemia response, 50% responded, including 58% of those who were transfusion dependent. Grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 25% of patients, while hyperlipasemia and headache were the most characteristic non-hematologic side effects. The above observation of a substantial response rate of the anemia with CYT387A as compared with other JAK2 inhibitors can be of clinical interest and warrants confirmation in a larger number of patients.

Longer follow-up is required to define the role of the JAK2 inhibitors in the treatment of MF. The trade-offs between clinical activity and toxicity will be the determinant to choose the right drug. Beside, information on the possible extra-hematologic effects in the long term is needed. This having being said, it is quite likely that the JAK2 inhibitors will have a major role in the treatment of MF in the coming years, especially for splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^246999c3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy—background and rationale indicate increasing utilization for benign, malignant and traumatic spleen-related diseases, and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is associated with decreased length of stay, operative blood loss, and total post-operative complications. However, variability in technical and peri-operative aspects such as patient positioning, blood product resuscitation, and hilar control techniques with unclear comparative effectiveness prompted the development of this guideline, and guidelines can assist the surgeon in peri-operative care based on systematic synthesis of best available evidence.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^8c613c8e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Decision criteria and additional considerations for splenic artery embolization in minimally invasive splenectomy emphasize that conversion to open is associated with additional risks that are important to patients, such as length of stay and return to work which were not reported in the two observational studies, and that the population to whom this is applied, such as pediatric versus adult, may impact the value for different outcomes, with long term sequelae of MVTE and transfusions potentially of higher value to younger patient populations. Not all hospitals have access to interventional radiology or interventional vascular capabilities, precluding the use of the intervention. Differences among affected patient populations influence the value of different outcomes as well as the feasibility and acceptability of splenic artery embolization; long term sequelae of the procedure may influence decision making more in pediatric populations, where children may benefit more from decreased transfusions but also experience greater long-term detriment from a potentially higher MVTE risk and may have less access to splenic artery embolization based on local acceptability and decreased feasibility due to small size and technical considerations. Patients with splenomegaly and arborized splenic arteries likely experience different outcomes from embolization that increase the desirable effects and decrease the undesirable effects, and patients with splenomegaly may place more value on decreased conversion to open and lower blood loss given a higher baseline risk for these outcomes.

JAKARTA

JAKARTA (NCT01437787) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly. A total of 289 patients were randomized to receive either INREBIC 500 mg (N=97), 400 mg (n=96) or placebo (n=96) once daily for at least 6 cycles. The median age was 65 years (range 27 to 86 years), 47% of patients were older than 65 years and 59% were male. Sixty-four percent (64%) of patients had primary MF, 26% had post-polycythemia vera MF, and 10% had post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients had intermediate-2 risk, and 48% had high-risk disease. The median baseline hemoglobin level was 10.2 g/dL. The median baseline platelet count was 214 × 109/L; 16% of patients had a platelet count <100 × 109/L and 84% of patients had a platelet count ≥100 × 109/L. Patients had a baseline median palpable spleen length of 15 cm. Patients had a baseline median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of 2568 mL (range of 316 to 8244 mL) (the upper limit of normal is approximately 300 mL). Patients underwent MRI or CT spleen volume assessment (after the third and sixth cycle) with a follow-up scan 4 weeks after Cycle 6.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^5d2b66cf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Trientine clinical use and comparative characteristics—Based on weight, trientine is a weaker chelator of copper than D-penicillamine; however, dose adjustments can compensate for small differences in induced cupriuresis, and trientine and D-penicillamine may mobilize different pools of body copper. Trientine is effective treatment for WD and is indicated especially in patients who are intolerant of D-penicillamine, and it may be preferable for patients with WD who have severe thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that can occur with splenomegaly. Paradoxical neurologic worsening after beginning treatment with trientine appears to be less common than with D-penicillamine, although head-to-head comparison was never performed. Trientine was effective initial therapy for patients, even with decompensated liver disease at the outset, and available data suggest that trientine is safe and effective in pediatric patients with WD.

NCCN T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia—indications for treatment and first-line therapy: Indications include ANC <0.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL or need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, platelets <50 x 10^9/L, autoimmune diseases with T-LGLLs requiring therapy, symptomatic splenomegaly, severe B symptoms, pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to LGLL, and ANC <1500 with documented T-LGLL and recurrent infections. With no indication, observe; if indication is present, preferred first-line options are clinical trial, low-dose methotrexate ± corticosteroids, oral cyclophosphamide ± corticosteroids, or cyclosporine ± corticosteroids, and management of underlying cytopenia(s) alone may be appropriate in certain circumstances. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Treat underlying autoimmune disease, monitor for cumulative toxicity with long-term methotrexate, and note that methotrexate with or without steroids may be beneficial in autoimmune disease; cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine may be used as a first- or second-line option in patients with anemia.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees-multiple States, 2015-2018 [^5b6e5fde]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 6 months before resettlement, all United States–bound refugees undergo a medical examination overseas conducted by panel physicians appointed by the U.S. Department of State, in accordance with technical instructions provided by CDC. In March and July 2015, among 987 refugees undergoing overseas medical examination in Uganda, 145 (14.7%) bound for 23 U.S. states † had palpable but presumably asymptomatic splenomegaly, prompting further investigation. This initial investigation failed to identify a clear etiology, but malaria was considered to be one of the potential causes. Because of the uncertain etiology, CDC established a mechanism for domestic U.S. clinicians to report postarrival clinical outcomes and receive guidance in the event that case management guidelines changed. The literature published on malaria-associated splenomegaly indicates that the condition usually resolves within months of departure from an area of malaria endemicity. However, throughout 2016, it became evident that despite implementation of the diagnostic and treatment protocol, § splenomegaly was not resolving in some patients. In response, on April 25, 2017, IOM asked CDC to investigate unresolved splenomegaly (defined as any palpable splenomegaly after arrival) among refugees with a diagnosis of splenomegaly before or after arrival to inform overseas and postarrival screening exams and clinical management. Goals were to describe associated or underlying conditions, clinician management strategies, and clinical outcomes.

Treatment of MF before the advent of JAK inhibitors

Drug therapy for PMF is not curative and has not been shown to display disease-modifying activity.Therefore, allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) is often considered if the goal of therapy is to prolong survival.ASCT for PMF is potentially curative but its value has been undermined by treatment-related complications, including death. In general, asymptomatic patients with low/intermediate-1 risk MF can be observed without specific treatment or with palliative therapy; androgens, prednisone, danazol, thalidomide and lenalidomide are used for the treatment of anemia and hydroxyurea for splenomegaly. In addition, splenectomy might be considered for drug-refractory splenomegaly and involved field radiotherapy for post-splenectomy hepatomegaly and non-hepatosplenic extramedullary hematopoiesis.

### Splenectomy in sickle cell disease: do benefits outweigh risks? [^5eef7e8f]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

The spleen is one of the first organs to be damaged in sickle cell disease (SCD). The unique environment of the spleen is particularly challenging for SCD erythrocytes, with constant intrasplenic sickling and trapping of erythrocytes in the red pulp causing repeated splenic injury from a very young age.This process is clinically silent in most children, manifesting mainly as progressive functional asplenia with a high risk of invasive bacterial infections,a complication that can be managed with daily prophylactic penicillin and appropriate immunizations. Nonetheless, some children with SCD experience other serious clinical complications related to the spleen, including acute splenic sequestration and chronic hypersplenism.

Acute splenic sequestration is an unpredictable and life-threatening complication particularly affecting young children with HbSS. Resulting from acute trapping of blood in the spleen caused by sudden enhanced intrasplenic sickling, symptoms include rapid splenic enlargement with acute anemia and potentially hypovolemia. Estimated rates of acute splenic sequestration vary according to age and sickle cell genotype. In HbSS, the first episode typically occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age, most within the first 2 years of life. After one episode of acute splenic sequestration, 67% of children with HbSS will experience a recurrent episode.In other SCD genotypes, such as HbSC disease and HbS/β + -thalassemia, acute splenic sequestration is more often reported in older children and young adults.Acute splenic sequestration is typically treated with blood transfusions and surgical splenectomy is often recommended for children with recurrent episodes. Another clinical indication for surgical splenectomy in SCD is hypersplenism. Persistent splenic enlargement is likely due to chronic intrasplenic erythrocyte sequestration and may be accompanied by low hemoglobin concentration, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, as well as abdominal pressure from the spleen and failure to thrive. The benefit/risk ratio of splenectomy is particularly complex in SCD. On the one hand, surgical splenectomy provides an immediate clinical benefit in children with recurrent acute splenic sequestration or severe hypersplenism. On the other hand, splenectomy may be associated with both short- and long-term surgical, septic, and thromboembolic risks which are not fully understood nor evaluated. Additionally, most children with SCD become functionally asplenic at a very young age, adding to the complexity of a surgical risk evaluation as outcomes on morbidity and mortality related to the spleen are very difficult to interpret. In a Letter to the Editor published in this issue of Haematologica, Pinto et al. compared survival and longterm complications in splenectomized and non-splenectomized individuals with SCD in Italy. Presenting retrospective data from 534 individuals with SCD, 117 (32%) of whom had undergone surgical splenectomy, the study provides novel evidence on the absence of longterm increased mortality related to surgical splenectomy in SCD. With a median follow-up of 26 years, this study is the first to provide such reassuring long-term post-splenectomy follow-up data. However, some important study features must be considered when extrapolating results to other clinical settings, particularly if they are to be used as guidance for clinical decision-making. The study included individuals with various genotypes reflecting the specific epidemiology of SCD in Italy: 32% had HbS/β + -thalassemia, 33% had HbS/β 0 -thalassemia, and only 35% had HbSS. The rate of surgical splenectomy varied significantly between these three genotypes, with as many as 53.4% of individuals with HbS/β 0 -thalassemia and 33.9% of individuals with HbS/β + -thalassemia having undergone surgical splenectomy, compared to just 9.6% of individuals with HbSS. Furthermore, the median age at splenectomy was 7 years in the HbSS group compared to 11 years in the HbS/β 0 -thalassemia group and 20 years in the HbS/β + -thalassemia group. Hypersplenism/recurrent splenic sequestration was the indication for splenectomy in 68.8% of patients, a percentage reflecting the high proportion of patients with HbS/β 0 -thalassemia and HbS/β + -thalassemia. Findings may therefore not accurately capture the risks of surgical splenectomy when performed in young children with HbSS, which is likely the majority of children requiring surgical splenectomy in many settings.
