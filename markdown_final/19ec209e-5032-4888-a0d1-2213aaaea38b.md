## Question

what is the role of compression arm sleeves on exercise performance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of compression arm sleeves on exercise performance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "exercise performance" typically encompasses and how to measure it. Then, I should verify whether compression sleeves improve acute performance during exercise. Next, I will examine their role in recovery and whether that indirectly affects subsequent performance. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and any potential harms. Finally, I will integrate the evidence into a practical conclusion with caveats and exceptions, making sure I double-check any overstatements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the scope of "exercise performance". I'm thinking about acute performance metrics such as power, strength, endurance, sprint times, and throwing accuracy, as well as perceptual measures like fatigue and soreness that can modulate performance, and biochemical markers of muscle damage such as creatine kinase that reflect recovery demands. I should also distinguish performance during exercise from recovery between bouts, because sleeves may influence one without changing the other [^116ArqzK] [^114feX5H].

> Now, I will examine whether arm sleeves improve performance during exercise itself. Wait, let me verify the direct evidence. In wheelchair athletes, intermittent sequential pneumatic compression arm sleeves applied after exercise did not improve performance recovery of grip strength, sprint capacity, or repeated sprints, indicating no direct performance benefit during or immediately after use, although perceptual fatigue and soreness signals were modestly improved, which is not the same as objective performance gains [^112zeT4G]. In cricket players, full-body compression garments did not enhance repeat-sprint times or throwing performance, despite small reductions in 24-hour creatine kinase and soreness, again suggesting no acute performance advantage during exercise [^116ArqzK]. In a meta-analysis of compression garments after damaging exercise, benefits were seen for DOMS, strength, and power recovery, but not for acute performance during exercise, reinforcing that the signal is in recovery rather than real-time performance enhancement [^114feX5H]. Hold on, I should also check for potential harms in some contexts; in hot environments, upper-body compression increased thermal strain and heart rate without aiding recovery, which could impair performance, so I need to be cautious about recommending sleeves during exercise in heat [^115YScoV].

> Next, I should review the recovery domain, because improved recovery could indirectly support subsequent performance. Let me consider the DOMS and muscle damage evidence. A meta-analysis found moderate effects of compression garments on reducing DOMS, restoring strength, and lowering creatine kinase after damaging exercise, indicating faster recovery of muscle function over 24–72 hours, which could translate into better readiness for the next training session or competition, albeit indirectly [^114feX5H]. In a small resistance-training study, wearing compression garments for 24 hours post-exercise accelerated recovery of upper-body strength within 3–8 hours and reduced soreness and fatigue the next morning, supporting a recovery benefit rather than an acute performance boost during exercise [^116yEQ5W]. In wheelchair athletes, pneumatic compression sleeves reduced perceived muscle fatigue and soreness at 24 hours, again pointing to perceptual recovery advantages without direct performance gains, which athletes may still value for readiness and training quality [^112zeT4G].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility to ensure these findings make sense. Compression can reduce muscle displacement and soft-tissue vibrations during activity, which might lessen microtrauma and fatigue signaling, although this did not translate into improved running economy in lower-limb studies, suggesting mechanical dampening alone is insufficient to enhance performance during exercise [^111V9tLN] [^113RWzML]. Let me verify hemodynamic hypotheses; while some have speculated about improved venous return, controlled work shows compression sleeves can increase retrograde shear stress in the brachial artery and, in young men, impair endothelial function over 30 minutes to 2 weeks, which is not a clearly beneficial physiological profile during exercise and may even be detrimental if sustained, so I should avoid over-attributing positive hemodynamic effects during exertion [^116c8mXj] [^116kjqgu]. But wait, what if compression reduces muscle swelling and thus improves comfort and range of motion during recovery? Indeed, after eccentric damage, continuous compression reduced swelling and improved force recovery and joint motion over several days, providing a plausible pathway for faster restoration of function even if it does not enhance real-time performance during exertion [^112mJet2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for indirect or context-specific performance claims. Tennis-focused reviews suggest that combining compression with other recovery strategies may improve readiness metrics and perceived recovery, but these are indirect and often unblinded, so I should be cautious about inferring causal performance gains from multimodal packages that include compression as one element [^117GYAyR]. Similarly, in esports, brief exercise breaks improved peripheral blood flow more than compression sleeves during prolonged sitting, reminding me that movement-based strategies may outperform passive compression for circulatory and cognitive outcomes in sedentary contexts, which is not identical to athletic performance but underscores the limited standalone role of sleeves during activity [^113kGMgu].

> I should confirm practical implications and safety. For athletes seeking marginal gains, sleeves are low risk and may improve comfort and perceived recovery, but expectations should be calibrated: they are unlikely to increase power, speed, or accuracy during exercise, and in hot environments they may worsen thermoregulatory strain, so timing and context matter [^115YScoV]. For post-exercise recovery, wearing sleeves for up to 24 hours may modestly accelerate the return of strength and reduce soreness, which could indirectly support subsequent training quality, though adherence and fit are important and the magnitude of benefit is moderate at best [^116yEQ5W] [^114feX5H].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure I'm not overstating. The weight of evidence indicates that compression arm sleeves do not directly enhance exercise performance during activity, but they may facilitate recovery by reducing DOMS, swelling, and perceived fatigue, thereby indirectly supporting readiness for subsequent performance, with the caveat that effects are modest and context-dependent and that potential vascular trade-offs can occur with prolonged or poorly fitted use [^116ArqzK] [^114feX5H] [^116c8mXj]. I should emphasize that any performance narrative for sleeves is largely indirect and recovery-focused rather than a real-time performance enhancer, and that individualized trials of use during and after training are reasonable while monitoring comfort, thermoregulation, and adherence [^112zeT4G] [^116yEQ5W].

Compression arm sleeves offer **modest recovery benefits** after exercise, including reduced muscle soreness [^114feX5H], faster strength recovery [^116yEQ5W], and less swelling [^112mJet2], but they **do not improve acute performance** metrics such as power, speed, or endurance [^116ArqzK] [^112zeT4G]. Any performance gains are likely due to improved comfort and reduced fatigue rather than direct physiological enhancement. Sleeves are most useful for **post-exercise recovery**, especially after high-intensity or eccentric training, and are safe for most athletes when properly fitted and used intermittently.

---

## Physiological mechanisms of compression sleeves

Compression sleeves are thought to influence performance through several **physiological mechanisms**:

- **Enhanced blood flow**: Graduated compression may improve venous return and reduce venous pooling, potentially enhancing oxygen delivery and waste product removal [^111d46Mc].

- **Reduced muscle oscillation**: Compression may limit muscle vibration during activity, potentially reducing microtrauma and fatigue [^111V9tLN].

- **Improved proprioception**: Increased sensory feedback from the skin and joints may enhance neuromuscular control and coordination [^112GTCJ4].

- **Reduced swelling and inflammation**: Compression can limit fluid accumulation and inflammatory responses, potentially aiding recovery [^112mJet2].

---

## Evidence on exercise performance

### Acute performance

Evidence regarding the **acute effects** of compression sleeves on performance is mixed:

- **No significant improvement**: Most studies report no significant improvements in acute performance metrics such as power output, speed, or endurance when compression sleeves are worn during exercise [^notfound].

- **Perceived benefits**: Athletes often report improved comfort, reduced fatigue, and enhanced proprioception, which may indirectly influence performance [^117GYAyR].

- **Neutral findings**: Studies involving wheelchair athletes and resistance-trained individuals have shown no significant improvements in acute performance metrics with compression sleeves [^notfound].

---

### Recovery and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)

Compression sleeves have been shown to provide **modest benefits** in post-exercise recovery:

- **Reduced muscle soreness**: Meta-analyses indicate that compression garments significantly reduce the severity of DOMS following strenuous exercise [^114feX5H].

- **Faster recovery of muscle function**: Compression sleeves have been associated with faster recovery of muscle strength and power, particularly after eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage [^112mJet2].

- **Reduced swelling**: Compression sleeves have been shown to reduce limb swelling and edema following intense exercise, potentially aiding recovery [^112mJet2].

---

## Specific populations and exercise modalities

The effectiveness of compression sleeves **varies by population** and exercise modality:

| **Population/exercise modality** | **Evidence of benefit** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Wheelchair athletes | Modest reduction in muscle fatigue and soreness | No significant improvement in acute performance metrics [^112zeT4G] |
| Resistance-trained individuals | Faster recovery of muscle strength | No significant improvement in acute performance [^112eYySP] |
| Endurance athletes | Mixed evidence | Some studies report improved comfort and reduced perceived fatigue, but no consistent improvement in performance metrics [^114Qs47x] |
| Individuals with lymphedema | Significant reduction in swelling and improved quality of life | Compression sleeves are recommended as part of standard care [^11313SAy] |

---

## Potential limitations and risks

While generally safe, compression sleeves may pose **some limitations and risks**:

- **Improper fit**: Ill-fitting sleeves may cause discomfort, skin irritation, or impaired circulation [^113Bv7Ex].

- **Over-reliance**: Athletes may become dependent on sleeves, neglecting other essential recovery strategies such as hydration, nutrition, and rest [^notfound].

- **Limited evidence**: The overall evidence base is mixed, with many studies showing minimal or no significant performance benefits [^113Bv7Ex].

---

## Practical recommendations

Based on current evidence, the following **practical recommendations** can be made:

- **Use for recovery**: Compression sleeves are most beneficial when used post-exercise to aid recovery, particularly after high-intensity or eccentric training [^112mJet2].

- **Proper fit**: Ensure sleeves are properly fitted to avoid discomfort or impaired circulation [^113Bv7Ex].

- **Combine with other strategies**: Use compression sleeves in conjunction with other recovery strategies such as hydration, nutrition, and rest [^117GYAyR].

- **Individualized use**: Athletes should experiment with compression sleeves during training to determine individual comfort and perceived benefits [^notfound].

---

Compression arm sleeves provide **modest recovery benefits**, including reduced muscle soreness, faster recovery of muscle function, and reduced swelling, but they **do not significantly improve acute exercise performance**. Their use is best suited for post-exercise recovery, particularly after high-intensity or eccentric training, and should be combined with other recovery strategies for optimal results.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^111hrUCr]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

At the start of this study the BIS criteria for lymphoedema diagnosis was a 3sd increase but mainly on the basis of small cross-sectional studies a criterion of 2sd has been proposed.

BIS (2sd or 3sd) assessed prospectively in a series with short follow-up time, whilst specific (85–92%), had a lower sensitivity and modest correlation with arm volume. Use of BIS measurements alone for early diagnosis would have led to threefold more patients having compression-sleeves applied inappropriately within 6 months (Table S2). A NICE review of limited data, found BIS was not as effective as current tests for diagnosing lymphoedema. Prospective BIS studies of sufficient size and length of follow-up of post ANC cancer patients have not been published but results from studies with 1-year follow-up support our longer-term findings.

By 1 year,-Dex increase of either 7.5 (51.8%) or 10 (39%) was identified in at least twice as many patients as RAVI > 10% (15.7%), a difference that remained constant at 60 months. The BIS criterion for a lymphoedema diagnosis at 6 months only identified 22% of women with lymphoedema (RAVI > 10%) by 24 months (Table 3). Supporters of BIS argue it identifies subclinical lymphoedema but with long term data it is clear it over diagnoses lymphoedema, as the rate of developing BIS > 7.5 or > 10 was significantly higher at all timepoints than either RAVI > 10% or the clinical need for compression sleeves.

### Effect of positioning and bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joint [^112GTCJ4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effects of positioning and sleeve type bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects.

Method

A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene sleeve type of brace at two different start positions (45 degrees internal rotation, 75 degrees external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0.5 degrees /s. The angular displacements from the target angles at the end of the reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores.

Results

The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0.99 (0.06)) was significantly (p < 0.001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p < 0.001) higher at the 45 degrees internal rotation start position than at the 75 degrees external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p > 0.05) interaction between brace application and start position.

Conclusion

Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors.

Lymphedema conservative care — MLD evidence and trials indicate limited standalone benefit. MLD is a major component of Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT), but the evidence for proving that MLD alone is an effective treatment is poor. In a randomized study on 42 patients assigned to 2 weeks of MLD plus hosiery versus hosiery alone, improvements in both groups were attributable to compression sleeves and MLD provided no extra benefit. A Cochrane review found little quality evidence for effectiveness, and a systematic review identified eight studies assessing MLD impact on quality of life with only one of the eight describing a statistically improved QOL; moreover, only one study of five showed a significant reduction in absolute lymphedema volume compared to control. A Cochrane systematic review reported two trials of MLD for breast cancer patients with small samples ranging from 24 to 45 participants and inadequate blinding; in two trials comparing MLD plus compression bandages versus compression bandages alone, response depended on the objective outcome measure, with significant percent volume reduction visible by water displacement but not by opto-electronic limb volumetry or circumferential tape measurements.

### Change in extracellular fluid and arm volumes as a consequence of a single session of lymphatic massage followed by rest with or without compression [^113qc3M1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the acute effect of massage and compression components of lymphoedema treatment in women with and without arm lymphoedema secondary to breast cancer from a single treatment session.

Methods

Women with (n = 15) and without (n = 15) lymphoedema underwent a single session of lymphatic massage. Following the session, women were randomised to receive or not receive a compression sleeve. Measurements were taken prior to, during, and following the massage as well as 30 min after completion of the massage. Bioimpedance spectrometry (BIS) was used to measure changes in extracellular fluid volume of all limbs as well as 10-cm segments within the upper limbs; perometry was used to measure changes in total upper limb volume as well as 10-cm segments within the limb.

Results

There were no significant changes after massage with or without compression. The median (and interquartile range) BIS ratios (unaffected:affected) for the whole upper limb for women with lymphoedema changed from 1.152 (1.053 to 1.422) to 1.192 (1.045 to 1.410) after massage, while the control group changed from 1.024 (0.998 to 1.047) to 1.041 (0.982 to 1.07). The median change in both the BIS ratio and the total arm volume measured with perometry from prior to the massage to following 30-min rest changed < 2%, irrespective of whether women used a compression garment and whether women presented with or without lymphoedema. Examination of 10-cm segments within the arm also revealed no significant change in BIS ratio from one segment to the next.

Conclusion

Massage alone or the application of compression after a single session of lymphatic massage was ineffective for reducing lymphoedema.

### Prophylactic use of compression sleeves reduces the incidence of arm swelling in women at high risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial [^112GyCz1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether prophylactic use of compression sleeves prevents arm swelling in women who had undergone axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer surgery.

Methods

Women (n = 307) were randomly assigned to either a compression or control group. In addition to usual postoperative care, the compression group received two compression sleeves to wear postoperatively until 3 months after completing adjuvant treatments. Arm swelling was determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) thresholds and relative arm volume increase (RAVI). Incidence and time free from arm swelling were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox regression models for BIS and RAVI thresholds independently. In addition, time to documentation of the first minimally important difference (MID) in four scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the breast cancer-specific (BR23) questionnaire was analyzed.

Results

The HR for developing arm swelling in the compression group relative to the control group was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.85; p = 0.004) on the basis of BIS and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.96; p = 0.034) on the basis of RAVI. The estimated cumulative incidence of arm swelling at 1 year was lower in the compression group than the control group on the basis of BIS (42% v 52%) and RAVI (14% v 25%). HRs for time from baseline to the first change of the minimally important difference were not statistically significant for any of the four scales of EORTC QLQ-30 and BR23 questionnaires.

Conclusion

Prophylactic use of compression sleeves compared with the control group reduced and delayed the occurrence of arm swelling in women at high risk for lymphedema in the first year after surgery for breast cancer.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^112CG4yM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

There was an interaction effect for acceleration at 12 km·h −1 in the anterior–posterior axis (P = 0.048), but not the medial–lateral (P = 0.303) or vertical (P = 0.725) axes. Specifically, compression significantly reduced acceleration at 12 km·h −1 in the thigh but had no effect on acceleration at 12 km·h −1 in the calf. There was a condition effect for acceleration at 12 km·h −1 in the medial–lateral axis (P = 0.009), but not the vertical (P = 0.195) axis. Specifically, acceleration at 12 km·h −1 was significantly lower for COMP as compared with CON 1. There were muscle effects for acceleration at 12 km·h −1 in the medial–lateral (P = 0.000) and vertical (P = 0.000) axes. Specifically, acceleration at 12 km·h −1 was significantly higher for thigh as compared with calf in the medial–lateral and vertical axes.

There were no interaction effects for acceleration at 15 km·h −1 in the medial–lateral (P = 0.598), anterior–posterior (P = 0.251), or vertical (P = 0.971) axes (Table 2). There were no condition effects for acceleration at 15 km·h −1 in the medial–lateral (P = 0.163), anterior–posterior (P = 0.157), or vertical (P = 0.632) axes. There were muscle effects for acceleration at 15 km·h −1 in the medial–lateral (P = 0.024) and vertical (P = 0.001) axes, but not in the anterior–posterior (P = 0.438) axis. Specifically, acceleration at 15 km·h −1 was significantly higher for thigh as compared with calf in the medial–lateral and vertical axes.

### Evidence-based, high-intensity exercise and physical activity for compressing morbidity in older adults: a narrative review [^112aX878]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

Translational Significance

A growing research base has shown the critical role of cardiorespiratory fitness and strength for reducing the risk of morbidity and premature death in lab-based settings for older adults. This research provides a viable basis for exercise programs by showing that brief, higher intensity interval, sprint, and resistance trainings can be performed two to three times per week with minimal equipment and are effective for improving cardiometabolic health and strength while also improving cognitive and affective functioning. Such exercises are associated with minimal adverse events and are not perceived as aversive by participants. This developing research base can be the foundation for a range of programs for older adults in community settings and at home.

The primary objective of this article is to perform a focused narrative review from our perspective of current advances in exercise science that can contribute to active aging and the public health goal of compressing morbidity. The goal of compressing morbidity is not necessarily to extend life. Rather the goal is to extend the quality of healthy, active life and reduce health burden and costs by delaying the onset of chronic diseases and disabilities through prevention approaches or early intervention.

The key is "effective". What do we know from exercise science about protocols that have multiple favorable effects and can, at a minimum, augment usual interventions for older adults such as the Diabetes Prevention Program where the prime exercise is usually lower- to moderate-intensity walking?

One reason for this review is that there have been considerable advancements in some areas of exercise science in the last 5 years, many highlighted and reviewed in the revised United States Physical Activity Guidelines, and some receiving less attention. However, there have been mixed outcomes in a highly funded, multisite, high-dose intervention for older adults at risk for major mobility disability, such as the LIFE intervention. At a minimum, these outcomes point toward examining the bases of interventions and other evidence-based alternatives and necessary prevention and treatment research and translation efforts.

This review is not suggesting that any one of the newer approaches represents a panacea and that masses of people will immediately embrace these new approaches. Rather, the findings are presented in the spirit of "promising developments" particularly with the exercise content of interventions. It also should be clear that these evidence-based approaches to exercise will not be readily initiated or maintained without accompanying sophisticated, theory-based approaches to behavior change. This review primarily focuses on one side of the translation equation — the actual content and required behaviors of these interventions — and also describes necessary research.

### Recovery interventions and strategies for improved tennis performance [^111cMUEU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The emphasis on improving recovery in tennis athletes has gained more research interest over the past decade. It is gaining greater value with practitioners who work with tennis athletes (tennis coaches, certified tennis performance specialists, physical therapists, athletic trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, etc). The purpose of many different recovery techniques is to limit the severity of fatigue and/or speed recovery from fatigue. Fatigue is the consequence of 'overloading' stressplaced on physiological systems and is reflective of the conditions or demands of a given activity, which in turn dictates the recovery that is needed. The challenge from a physiological standpoint is that different types of training induce different types of fatigue. When power output cannot be maintained or homoeostasis cannot be achieved in a given set of physiological systems, fatigue occurs. A host of physiological mechanisms including central and peripheral factors are believed to contribute to fatigue. – Tennis players have been shown to suffer stroke accuracy decrement as high as 81% with increasing play durations. Fernandez et al have suggested playing style, gender, training status, playing surface, ball type and environment as the primary contributors to fatigue in tennis. The varied causes of fatigue make it difficult to determine the best recovery modalities for the tennis athlete. As recovery is such a broad topic, it is not feasible in this review to cover all the techniques that are used to help tennis athletes recover from strenuous physical training or competition. However, this review will cover four areas of recovery techniques commonly used in tennis with the belief that the interventions may improve athlete recovery and, therefore, improve adaptation and future performance. The four areas covered are: (1) temperature-based interventions, (2) compressive clothing, (3) electronic interventions and (4) nutritional interventions.

### Compression garment promotes muscular strength recovery after resistance exercise [^116yEQ5W]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to investigate the effects of wearing a compression garment (CG) for 24 h on changes in muscular strength and blood parameters over time after resistance exercise.

Methods

Nine trained men conducted resistance exercises (10 repetitions of 3–5 sets at 70% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) for nine exercises) in two trials, wearing either a CG or a normal garment (CON) for 24 h after exercise. Recovery of muscular strength, blood parameters, muscle soreness, and upper arm and thigh circumference were compared between the trials.

Results

Both trials showed decreases in maximal strength after the exercise (P < 0.05). However, the CG trial showed faster recovery of one-repetition maximum for the chest press from 3 to 8 h after exercise (P < 0.05). Recovery of maximal knee extension strength was also improved in the CG trial 24 h after exercise (P < 0.05). The CG trial was associated with lower muscle soreness and subjective fatigue scores the following morning (P < 0.05). The upper arm and thigh circumferences were significantly higher during the recovery period in the CON trial, whereas no change was observed in the CG trial. Blood lactate, insulin like growth factor-1, free testosterone, myoglobin, creatine kinase, interleukin 6, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations for 24 h after exercise were similar in both trials.

Conclusions

Wearing a CG after resistance exercise facilitates the recovery of muscular strength. Recovery for upper body muscles significantly improved within 3–8 h after exercise. However, facilitation of recovery of lower limb muscles by wearing the CG took a longer time.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^111RbgrS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Experimental Procedures

Assessment of vascular function and resting diameter were conducted in a quiet, temperature‐controlled environment, according to recent expert consensus guidelines. 30 Repeated laboratory visits were conducted at the same time of day to control for diurnal variation. 31 Before each test, subjects were instructed to fast for at least 6 hours, abstain from alcohol and caffeine for 18 hours, and avoid any exercise for 24 hours.

Retrograde shear intervention

Immediately after the initial FMD assessment, a compression sleeve was applied on the right forearm. To achieve sufficient pressure, the sleeve was folded 2 or 3 times, depending on the circumference of the forearm. Based on pilot work, a 2‐fold sleeve was used for subjects with a circumference of > 27 cm and a 3‐fold sleeve for subjects with a circumference of < 27 cm. Based on subjective feedback from the subject on convenience and/or complaints of venous congestion of the hand, we adjusted the times the sleeve was folded. Thirty minutes after wearing the compression sleeve, brachial artery FMD was re‐assessed. After 2 weeks, subjects reported back to the Department for a final assessment of brachial artery diameter, SR pattern, and FMD%, as described above with all postintervention tests performed with the compression sleeve applied to the forearms. 32

Assessment of brachial artery flow‐mediated dilation (FMD%)

Before, 30 minutes following, and 2 weeks after sleeve application, endothelium‐dependent, 33 mainly NO‐mediated, 34 vasodilator function was examined using the flow‐mediated dilation (FMD%). First, subjects rested in the supine position for at least 15 minutes to facilitate baseline assessment of heart rate and blood flow. Heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were measured twice by an experienced researcher from the left brachial artery using a manual sphygmomanometer. To examine brachial artery FMD%, a 10‐MHz multifrequency linear‐array probe attached to a high‐resolution ultrasound machine (T3000; Terason, Burlington, MA) was used to image the brachial arteries in the distal one third of the upper arm. Details for these procedures can be found elsewhere. 32 Baseline diameter of the brachial artery was assessed across the 1‐minute period preceding the 5‐minute cuff inflation.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^114Ggb4e]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The Perometer is the most objective tool to measure arm swelling. Treatment decisions to apply compression sleeves based on subjective information (patient reported arm symptoms) have led to lymphoedema staging classifications describing a prodromal or latent phase of lymphoedema characterised by arm heaviness or swelling. This study suggests that application of a compression sleeve based upon clinical symptoms of swelling and/or heaviness alone in the absence of a measurable change in RAVI is likely to lead to misdiagnosis and overtreatment. In the absence of a RAVI > 5%, quality-of-life was not improved by sleeve application.

Screening for 'subclinical' lymphoedema to enable intervention to reduce the risk of developing clinical lymphoedema is recommended internationally, despite the weak evidence base. For 'subclinical' lymphoedema, prescribing of 'prophylactic' compression-sleeves has occurred internationally without any randomised evidence of efficacy. Nearly 16% of our women who had treatment compression-sleeves (20–25 mmHg) applied progressed to moderate lymphoedema despite claims that intervention with compression sleeves prevented lymphoedema development. Other studies report 35% of lymphoedema patients progress after sleeve application. A randomised controlled trial of External Compression Sleeves (20–25 mmHg) Therapy + 'standard management' (written advice, arm elevation, exercises and massage) versus 'standard management' alone to prevent LE found no difference in LE rate between the interventions.

### It's about timing: how density can benefit future research on the optimal dosage of acute physical exercise breaks in esports [^113kGMgu]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Using a within-subject cross-over study design with pretest–post-test comparison, DiFrancisco-­Donoghue and colleaguesobserved that in highly competitive esports players interrupting a 2-hour esports session after 60 min with a 6-minute light-intensity walk (ie, an average score of 10.5 on the 6–20 rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale) as compared with continuous play or rest in a supine position, improved planning performance (ie, operationalised by the Tower of London test) and self-perceived esports performance. However, the latter was not mirrored in objective measures (eg, percentages of games won). Moreover, in another study using a comparable study design, DiFrancisco­-Donoghue et al noticed that a 6-minute light-intensity walking break (ie, an average score of 9.5 on the 6–20 RPE scale) mitigated the decline of peripheral blood flow (ie, measured at the popliteal artery) observed for continuous sitting even to a greater extent than wearing compression sleeves. Based on the observation that in non-esports players (ie, healthy younger adults or desk workers), acute physical exercise breaks can counteract the negative effect of prolonged sitting on specific measures of cerebral blood flow, it seems reasonable to assume that in esports players the positive effects of acute physical exercise breaks observed for measures of the peripheral blood flow may generalise to the cerebral blood flow. Addressing this gap in the literature is a promising area for future investigations given that acute exercise-induced change in cerebral blood flow is a putative candidate mechanism contributing to postexercise cognitive performance improvements. However, further well-designed studies on esports players are required to test this assumption empirically.

While the above-presented evidence suggests that acute physical exercise can positively affect the gaming performance of esports players, the most effective dosage remains somewhat unclear. To provide evidence-based recommendations for optimising esports training, we propose that future research is required to identify the optimal dosage of acute physical exercise to interrupt periods of prolonged sitting in esports training sessions.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^113yi4Kt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Advanced age is associated with progressive loss of endothelial function 19, 20, 21 and reduced arterial compliance. 22, 23 These changes may contribute to chronically elevated levels of retrograde shear stress with older age, 24, 25 and may also impact upon the ability of the vasculature to respond to changes in retrograde shear. Interestingly, previous studies in animals reported distinct adaptations to shear stress between young and older individuals. 26, 27, 28, 29 However, no previous study has explored whether prolonged exposure to elevated retrograde shear leads to distinct adaptations in brachial artery vasomotor function between healthy young and older humans.

We examined the impact of prolonged (ie, 2 weeks) exposure to elevated levels of retrograde shear in the brachial artery of healthy young and healthy older men in vivo. For this purpose, we have customized a compression sleeve that subjects can wear continuously. By applying compression to the forearm, we hypothesized that the upstream brachial artery would be exposed to increased levels of resting retrograde shear stress. This approach allows us to examine the impact of chronic elevation in brachial artery retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function. To this end, we examined the brachial artery before and after 30 minutes and 2 weeks of forearm compression. We expected that chronic elevation of retrograde shear, unopposed by elevations in antegrade shear, would cause a decrease in upstream brachial endothelial function in young men, but not in healthy older men.

### Postural differences in the immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower limb lymphedema [^111NB9L6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Multilayered compression bandages have been shown to have a greater positive effect on lymphatic drainage than elastic clothing. The ISL recommends 60 mmHg as the maximum compression tolerable for lymphedema patients. For stage II, late-stage II, and stage III lymphedema patients, a pressure of > 45 mmHg is recommended. In this study, a compression pressure of 40 mmHg was used on the distal limb because a sub-bandage pressure exceeding 40 mmHg is recommended to counteract intravenous pressure in the antigravity position, and sub-bandage pressure rises during exercise. In order to obtain consistent compression, the bandages were applied by the same person in all trials, and a pressure measurement device (KIKUHIME TM) that has been shown to have high reliability and validity was used.

With regard to the exercise modality, the active exercise was then performed using a variable-load ergometer because it allows muscle activity of the whole lower limb even at low loads and can be pedaled while seated or supine. The target heart rate was calculated using the Karvonen formula, and the exercise load amount was adjusted below the anaerobic threshold (AT). The AT is one of the indices of exercise intensity, and energy supply is provided by aerobic mechanisms at less than AT. Supine AECT is reported to generate an early anaerobic response because of the positional reduction in blood flow to the limbs. Therefore, an exercise intensity of 30% was selected so that all participants would be able to perform the exercise.

Previous studies have shown beneficial effects on limb volume of exercise sessions ranging from 15 to 60 min in duration. Goboy et al. showed an immediate effect on ULL after a total of 48 min of exercise (four sets of 12 min each). In our previous study, an immediate effect on LLL was obtained after 15 min of exercise. Shorter exercise times are most likely to have good patient compliance in home-based therapy programs, so an exercise duration of 15 min was selected in the present study. The effects of exercise on ULL have been reported to last 1 h, but there are no data on the duration of exercise effects in LLL patients. For this reason, at least 1 week was allowed between exercise sessions to avoid potential cumulative effects.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^113RWzML]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Contrary to our hypothesis, compression-induced reductions in muscle vibrations and activation had no effect on markers of running economy. Previous studies investigating the effects of different compression garments on the energetics of running are mixed, with compression being reported to reduce, have no effect, and even increase oxygen consumption/energy cost during submaximal treadmill running. Although a recent review by Engel et al. reported that compression garments have a small positive effect to improve running economy (mean Hedges g = 0.21 ± 0.38, range = 0.00–0.88), the current study supports the majority of research to date suggesting a limited effect. A potential explanation for the discordant effects of compression on running economy (i.e. submaximal oxygen consumption) between the current study and that of Bringard et al. is the duration of submaximal running stages used. Considering that steady-state V̇O 2 tends to be achieved after 3 min of exercise at a constant pace, the 3-min durations used in the current study may have been too short to observe any measurable effect during exercise. In addition, energy demand is typically underestimated with treadmill running as compared with traditional overground running, which may limit the applicability of results from the current study. Metabolic measures aside, compression-induced alterations in muscle vibrations may have influenced running kinematics (e.g. ground contact time, step frequency, step length, and swing time) and/or leg stiffness. Considering running kinematics have been implicated in altering mechanical efficiency and/or running economy, these measures may represent a more sensitive means to investigate potential compression-induced changes in running economy.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^112HJbm4]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Preoperative objective arm volume measurements (rather than BIS), are essential to the appropriate management of lymphedema after breast cancer treatment. Such objectivity would reduce NHS costs and ensure that patients who will benefit from compression therapy are offered treatment. Self-reported symptoms are common after surgery and need corroboration with arm volume measurements.

Prescription of compression sleeves in lymphoedema, improves symptoms and quality-of-life. High BMI increases development and progression of lymphoedema. Weight reduction strategies are required to prevent lymphoedema developing after axillary surgery and radiotherapy.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^1164VvT5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although acute elevation in retrograde shear rate (SR) impairs endothelial function, no previous study has explored the effect of prolonged elevation of retrograde SR on conduit artery vascular function. We examined the effect of 2-weeks elevation of retrograde SR on brachial artery endothelial function in young and in older men.

Methods and Results

Thirteen healthy young (23 ± 2 years) and 13 older men (61 ± 5 years) were instructed to continuously wear a compression sleeve around the right forearm to chronically (2 weeks) elevate brachial artery retrograde SR in 1 arm. We assessed SR, diameter, and flow-mediated dilation in both the sleeve and contralateral control arms at baseline and after 30 minutes and 2 weeks of continuous sleeve application. The sleeve intervention increased retrograde SR after 30 minutes and 2 weeks in both young and older men (P = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively). In young men, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation % was lower after 30 minutes and 2 weeks (P = 0.004), while resting artery diameter was reduced after 2 weeks (P = 0.005). The contralateral arm showed no change in retrograde SR or flow-mediated dilation % (P = 0.32 and 0.26, respectively), but a decrease in diameter (P = 0.035). In older men, flow-mediated dilation % and diameter did not change in either arm (all P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Thirty-minute elevation in retrograde SR in young men caused impaired endothelial function, while 2-week exposure to elevated levels of retrograde SR was associated with a comparable decrease in endothelial function. Interestingly, these vascular changes were not present in older men, suggesting age-related vascular changes to elevation in retrograde SR.

Methods

Study design

Non-blinded intervention studies were conducted by block-randomized, crossover, comparison trials (3rd, 3rd intervention, 6 ways) (Fig. 1). The interventions were AECT in a seated position (seated AECT), AECT in a supine position (supine AECT), and compression-only therapy in a supine position (CT) (Fig. 2). AECT was performed on a bicycle ergometer, and CT was performed with elevation of both legs while wearing elastic compression bandages on the affected limb. Each intervention was performed for 15 min, and the three conditions were separated by a 1-week washout period. Participants performed normal self-care between the interventions.

Fig. 1
Study design: The trial had a randomized, controlled, crossover design. Each intervention was performed for 15 min, and the three interventions were separated by a ≥ 1-week washout period to eliminate any carryover effects. Measurements were taken before and after each intervention. Six patterns of intervention order were applied, with computer-generated randomization to eliminate order effects. *AECT, active exercise with compression therapy; seated AECT, AECT in a seated position; supine AECT, AECT in a supine position; CT, compression-only therapy

Post-operative surveillance is also advocated to detect early clinical lymphoedema so that early intervention to reduce the risk of progression and complications such as cellulitis can be carried out. To facilitate this a standardised objective method of diagnosing early lymphoedema is required.

In this prospective multicentre study, we sought to (1) compare five methods for diagnosis of lymphoedema, (2) identify which patients were at risk of developing lymphoedema, (3) develop a criterion score to identify patients who would benefit from compression sleeve application and (4) determine the relationship between lymphoedema diagnosis and quality-of-life.

Progression of Lymphoedema

At sleeve application 187 patients had a RAVI < 20% but despite compression-sleeves application for 22 (IQR 11–33) months, progression to RAVI ≥ 20% occurred in 29 cases (15.7%).

Garment pressure measurements

There were no condition effects for pressure applied to the limb at landmark C (P = 0.392), landmark D (P = 0.165), landmark E (P = 0.540), or landmark F (P = 0.112). However, there was a condition effect for pressure applied to the limb at landmark A (P = 0.000) and landmark B (P = 0.028). Specifically, the pressure applied to limb at landmarks A (P = 0.000) and B (P = 0.008) was significantly higher in 2XU as compared with UA. In addition, the pressure applied to the limb at landmark A was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in 2XU as compared with Nike (Table 3).

### Black holes in compression therapy: a quest for data [^113Bv7Ex]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

CT and sport

Compression during or after sport does not represent a clinical indication but, it is a very debated topic and deserves to be mentioned in this review. Compression by specifically designed elastic stockings has spread over the years in several sports activities.

Compression during or after sport is applied to increase the sport's performance and benefit recovery. Even in this field, the effectiveness of compression is very debated. Studies usually include a small sample size; there is a lack of homogeneity owing to the use of different stockings in different sports, the level of sports participants (if professionals or only passionate), when and how long the stockings were worn, and the variety of sports socks regarding exerted pressure and pressure profile (graduated or progressive). In addition, sports and industry lobbies may have influenced some publications with a high biases risk and conflicts of interest. Regarding performance increase by compression, some studies report beneficial effects, whereas others, without biases, raise many doubts. Many studies report positive effects in recovery time, without influencing the next sports performance. There are also sparse data on reduced exercise-associated hemostatic activation decreasing the DVT risk during prolonged exerciseand on reduced perceived fatigue. In this field, future studies are mandatory to confirm whether compression effectively improves recovery after sport or enhances sports performance. The beneficial effects of compression in athletes with varicose veins should be addressed as well. No study considered athletes with varicose veins, but many athletes with varicose veins ask about their disease and sport!

Lack of education resulting in poor patient compliance

IBs are challenging to apply and require education. Some papers, report that many health care professionals cannot apply IB with proper pressure. The pressure can be too low and ineffective or too strong, resulting in painful and potentially dangerous compression. Even with MCS, prescription mistakes regarding size and compression pressure can be made. The lack of education in CT application or prescription can be a reason for noncompliance because the patients can find no benefit from compression or find it painful and harmful. Compression wraps represent a new compression modality. A short education time for the patient can be enough to apply the device properly. Even with these devices, special care for a proper prescription is necessary.

### Exercise and cancer-related lymphedema in the lower limbs-a randomized cross-over trial on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with and without compression garments [^116yJSz7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice and clinical research

In summary, the findings of this study show that it was possible to recruit participants with LLL to an exercise intervention with HIIT. Additionally, no serious adverse events occurred, and the immediate increase in soft tissue mass and extracellular fluid after exercise without compression garments is expected to normalize with reapplication of compression based on previous studies trials. However, the results are only based on 2 sessions of HIIT, and the long-term effect on LLL symptoms and objective outcomes was not investigated. Larger and longitudinal exercise trials in the field of LLL are clearly needed.

Several participants felt uncomfortable when exercising with Bermuda in combination with thigh-high stockings. They reported higher rates of exertion during the exercise and were among the participants who preferred to exercise without compression. Participants with limited volume increase and severity of LLL may benefit from sports compression tights. Sports compression clothing is widely used among athletes to improve performance and recovery time and reduce muscle soreness. A pilot study found a decrease in extracellular fluid in participants with stage I LLL measured by BIS, although perometry did not confirm the finding. The authors suggested that sports compression tights might remove barriers towards engaging in exercise since sports compression tights can seem more socially acceptable than regular compression garments and are easier to apply.

Based on the findings from our trial, clinicians may consider a less conservative approach to the use of compression garments during exercise for patients with LLL since exercise often is of short duration and compression garments are reapplied after exercise. This may increase the adherence to regular exercise and improve the health and wellbeing of patients with LLL. However, advice on exercise and compression garments to patients with LLL should be individualized until evidence is provided as highlighted by Singh et al.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^117RgDHm]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Increasing cancer survival will increase patients at risk of the consequences of their treatments. USA National Lymphoedema Network Guidelinesrecommend lymphoedema screening for all patients after axillary surgery or radiotherapy, which is frequently done using BIS alone. In this lymphoedema screening study, arm volume measurements more reliably diagnosed and predicted risk of lymphoedema, than BIS. The large cohort allowed accurate assessment of the diagnostic health technology involved but limits the strength inferring any causality about effects seen. Similar factors (RAVI > 5%, BMI > 30, and number of involved nodes) predicted development of lymphoedema, and its progression despite compression-sleeve therapy.

Screening for 'subclinical' lymphoedema is only appropriate if objective measures (RAVI > 5%) are used to allow early intervention with compression-sleeves and if this intervention reduces the risk of developing clinical lymphoedema.

The lack of standardised diagnostic criteria for lymphoedema make estimation of the true incidence of lymphoedema difficult.– Baseline measurements comparing both arms of individual women found 8.3% of patients exhibited marked arm volume (> 200 ml) differences regardless of BMI, supporting the need for pre-surgery baseline measurements.

Up to 25% of patients reported symptoms of swelling and/or heavinessin their ipsilateral limb before surgery. RAVI (not BIS) changes were associated with increased symptom reporting. Rigorous pre-operative baseline and subsequent measurements are required to determine the significance of any arm volume changes. Relative arm volume change is the optimal method for early diagnosis of lymphoedema.

DiSipio reviewed 30 prospective studies and estimated by 2 years around 21.4% patients developed lymphoedema after ANC.

### The acute effects of compression garments on muscle protein synthesis markers, blood flow, performance, and perceived recovery after resistance exercise [^112eYySP]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Purpose

Compression garments are a commonly used recovery aid following resistance exercise, which may improve muscle blood flow and perceived recovery. However, there has been limited insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms that may mediate the physiological effects of compression garments. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of compression tights on markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, and indices of recovery following a bout of resistance exercise.

Methods

Twenty resistance-trained participants (5 females, 15 males) completed a leg-press exercise session followed by a 5-h recovery period wearing either commercially available compression tights (COMP, n = 10) or no tights (CON, n = 10). Physiological (markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, blood lactate, blood glucose), perceptual (total quality of recovery, perceived muscle soreness and subjective wellbeing), and performance measures (countermovement jump and isometric mid-thigh pull) were collected at baseline, immediately post-exercise (performance and perceptual only), and at 1-h (physiological and perceptual only), 5-h and 24-h post-exercise.

Results

No significant (p < 0.05) interactions were observed between groups in physiological, performance, and perceptual measures. There were main effects of time for post-exercise measures compared to baseline (p < 0.05), with increased markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, blood lactate, muscle soreness, and reduced blood glucose, total quality of recovery, subjective wellbeing, and countermovement jump height for both groups.

Conclusions

Commercially available compression tights used post-resistance exercise did not influence muscle protein synthesis markers, muscle blood flow or indices of exercise recovery following resistance exercise in the current study.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^113J6nqh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

No previous reports have provided data regarding the immediate effects of AECT on LLL. AECT for LLL thus lacks clear evidence regarding appropriate exercise intensity, timing, or type. Our study represents the first report of a randomized, controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the immediate effects of AECT on LLL. Changes in lower-limb volume were significantly greater with high-load AECT than with CT. Severity of skin stiffness and pitting edema symptoms pre-intervention correlated significantly with the volume decrement under both high- and low-load AECT.

Interventions

In our study, multi-layered compression bandaging using short stretch bandages was adopted as a compression therapy. Damstra et al. reported median sub-bandage pressure immediately after application as 64 mmHg. We applied a pressure of 40 mmHg, because a sub-bandage pressure exceeding 40 mmHg is recommended to counteract intravenous pressure in the antigravity position, and sub-bandage pressure rises during exercise. To reduce the unevenness of the sub-bandage pressure in each participant, measurements were made at the facies posterior cruris using Kikuhime™ pressure sensors (TT Meditrade), which provide a digital output from pressure transducers comprising an air-filled pressure sensor and the device. The accuracy and precision of Kikuhime™ have already been reported.

Concerning the exercise modality, we considered that it was reasonable for patients with lymphedema to perform the exercises. In our study, active exercise therapy was performed on a bicycle ergometer, which offers some benefits. First, this modality is safe because of the low risk of falls. During pedaling, muscle activity of the whole lower limb is involved. In addition, pedaling reportedly places less stress on the knee joint than muscle strengthening exercises of the quadriceps with weight loading and squats.

This study involved a randomized crossover design in which participants completed three interventions separated by 1-week washout periods. Moseley et al. showed that the reduction in arm volume induced by exercise gradually returned, reaching the baseline volume by 60 min. The washout period in this study was thus judged as both necessary and sufficient.

Study Characteristics

An overview of the study characteristics of these studies is shown in the Table 1. Overall, participants were primarily from China and the United States, with an average age ranging from 50 to 62 years. The sample size of each study ranged from 63 to 186. Two of the trials were sponsored by the government, and one was sponsored by institution. Three of the trials focused on breast cancer patients, and one on lung cancer patients. All trials applied pressures within the range of 20–32 mmHg. Adherence was defined differently in each trial and varied from 72.6% to 98.3%. Most of trials utilized conventional treatment as a control, while Accordino'sselection employed loose long-sleeved tops and gloves as a control. Three trials opted to assess CIPN used the NCI-CTCAE scale, whereas Accordinochose the FACT-NTX scale for CIPN assessment. All trials followed up with patients for a minimum of 12 weeks, with an average follow-up duration of 16.4 weeks (SD 5.7).

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^116c8mXj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although acute elevation in retrograde shear rate impairs endothelial function, no previous study has explored the effect of prolonged elevation of retrogradeon conduit artery vascular function. We examined the effect of 2‐weeks elevation of retrogradeon brachial artery endothelial function in young and in older men.

Methods and Results

Thirteen healthy young (23 ± 2 years) and 13 older men (61 ± 5 years) were instructed to continuously wear a compression sleeve around the right forearm to chronically (2 weeks) elevate brachial artery retrogradein 1 arm. We assessed, diameter, and flow‐mediated dilation in both the sleeve and contralateral control arms at baseline and after 30 minutes and 2 weeks of continuous sleeve application. The sleeve intervention increased retrogradeafter 30 minutes and 2 weeks in both young and older men (P = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively). In young men, brachial artery flow‐mediated dilation % was lower after 30 minutes and 2 weeks (P = 0.004), while resting artery diameter was reduced after 2 weeks (P = 0.005). The contralateral arm showed no change in retrogradeor flow‐mediated dilation % (P = 0.32 and 0.26, respectively), but a decrease in diameter (P = 0.035). In older men, flow‐mediated dilation % and diameter did not change in either arm (all P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Thirty‐minute elevation in retrogradein young men caused impaired endothelial function, while 2‐week exposure to elevated levels of retrogradewas associated with a comparable decrease in endothelial function. Interestingly, these vascular changes were not present in older men, suggesting age‐related vascular changes to elevation in retrograde.

It is an auto-adjustable semi-open sleeve (Thuasne, Saint-Etienne, FRANCE) available in six sizes, two lengths, left/right arm (Fig. 1) with several semi-rigid straps used to adjust the device to each patient's morphology or volumes changes. This garment uses the patented MOBIDERM® technology composed of foam blocks in soft adherent webbing. It creates, on and under the skin, zones of differentiated pressure between the foam blocks and their perimeter allowing a local mobilization to facilitate edema fluid evacuation.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint was the volume excess (also called lymphedema volume) variation, defined as the volumetric difference of the affected limb compared to the contralateral upper limb, between Day 0 and Day 30. Volumes were calculated after taking patients measurements every 5 cm, above (4 measurements) and below (4 measurements) the fold of the elbow (start point) and using the truncated cone formula: [H × (C² + C × c + c²)/(12π)], H = cone height, C = cone top circumference, and c = cone base circumference. This method demonstrated excellent inter- and intra-observer reproducibility in comparison to water displacement, which is considered the gold standard.

The comparison of the volume excess variation (mL, %) from Day 0 to Day 30 between the two randomization groups was performed using a bilateral Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test on the ITT population. All secondary endpoints and PP analysis were provided only descriptively: functional symptoms at Day 30 and Day 90 vs. baseline, QOL based on LYMQOL ARM questionnaire at each study visits and patient's satisfaction with self-reported questionnaires, compliance of the treatment evaluated by patient diary between Day 0 and Day 30 and by questioning the patients at D90 regarding the study period between Day 30 and Day 90.

Safety and tolerance data were assessed by numbers and percentages of patients with at least one reported adverse event (AE) tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.

As there is no previous specific published trial on night garment in maintenance phase of lymphedema, sample size calculation was not possible for this a proof of concept study.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^116kjqgu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies provide strong evidence that (repeated) elevations in antegrade or mean SR represent a potent hemodynamic stimulus that acutely and chronically alters vascular function and structure. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 As a logical follow‐up study from initial findings that acute elevation in retrograde shear induces impairment in endothelial function, 2 this study aimed to assess the effect of chronic (ie, 2 weeks) manipulation of retrograde SR in humans in vivo. First, we successfully introduced a compression sleeve in young and older men, as a simple and easily applied tool to elevate resting retrograde SR in the brachial artery for 2 weeks. Our findings indicate that 30 minutes of wearing this compression sleeve in young, healthy men significantly decreased brachial artery endothelial function. Impaired brachial artery endothelial function in young men remained present after 2 weeks of exposure to elevated levels of retrograde SR. Finally, and in marked contrast with young men, we found no acute (30‐minute) or chronic (2‐weeks) impact of elevating retrograde SR levels on brachial artery endothelial function in healthy older men. These unique in vivo data in humans reveal the impact of increased retrograde SR on brachial artery vasculature, while this effect may differ based on age.

In previous studies, we used pneumatic cuffs to manipulate retrograde shear acutely. 2, 12 For chronic shear manipulation, however, blood pressure cuffs are impractical. Therefore, in the present study we have introduced customized compression sleeves as a novel method to chronically manipulate levels of retrograde SR. In both young and older men, retrograde SR significantly increased after both 30 minutes and 2 weeks of wearing the compression sleeve. In this manner, this study successfully introduced compression sleeves as a method to manipulate retrograde SR, both acutely and chronically in men in vivo. Although a nonsignificant increase was found in antegrade SR in both young and older men, the main observation was that we (in line with our previous work) successfully manipulated retrograde shear. 2, 12, 39 Although we only explored the impact of the sleeve intervention on resting levels of retrograde shear, we are confident that increased levels of retrograde SR were also present during various activities of daily living. In a series of previous studies, we have demonstrated that various types of physical activity (cycling, walking, handgrip exercise), performed at low and moderate intensity, lead to increases in brachial artery retrograde SR. 4, 40 Therefore, physical activities of daily living unlikely altered the exposure to increased levels of retrograde SR in our study.

### Postural differences in the immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower limb lymphedema [^1112oUyx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymphedema is the accumulation of high protein fluid in the interstitium due to the failure of lymphatic transport or dysfunction of interstitial protein processing. Lymphedema can be primary or secondary, the former resulting from congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system and the latter due to injury or dysfunction of lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes. Secondary lymphedema of the lower limb in cancer patients can develop after lymph node resection during surgery or lymphatic damage by radiotherapy.

Lymphedema can progress from mild to severe swelling with accompanying leakage of lymph from the skin and cellulitis; severe symptoms can adversely affect patients' quality of life, ability to perform their activities of daily living, and psychosocial health. Early and appropriate treatment is essential. Combined physical therapy (CPT) is the recommended treatment for lymphedema. CPT consists of skin care, manual lymph drainage, compression therapy using multilayered bandages and elastic garments, and exercise. Although CPT is widely practiced in clinical settings, there is little evidence regarding its effects, especially for LLL.

Active exercise with compression therapy (AECT) is recommended as part of CPT. Several reports have examined the effects of AECT on upper limb lymphedema (ULL). Concerning the long-term effects, Schmitz et al. found that patients who lifted weights while wearing an elastic sleeve after breast cancer surgery showed improvements in lymphedema symptoms and muscle strength. Other studies have shown similar improvements in upper limb volumes after medium to long-term exercise interventions. Exercise and compression have been shown to have immediate beneficial effects on edema. Concerning the immediate effects, Godoy et al. compared edema before and after four 12-min sets of upper body exercises performed while wearing an elastic sleeve; they found a significant decrease in upper limb volume. Moseley et al. reported that the edema-alleviating effect of AECT lasted 1 h when combined with deep breathing.

### Blood pressure measurements on a bare arm, over a sleeve or below a rolled-up sleeve: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rmkEa]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several guidelines call for blood pressure (BP) measurement on a bare arm, which is not always easy. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence concerning the effect of a sleeve on BP measurement.

Methods

Pubmed and Embase were searched for cross-sectional studies comparing BP values measured on a bare arm, over a sleeve or below a rolled-up sleeve. A meta-analysis was conducted on available data.

Results

Thirteen articles were selected from 720 references. All studies reported office BP values, 12 compared measurements on a bare arm and on a sleeve, and four also performed measurements below a rolled-up sleeve, with heterogeneous sleeve types and thicknesses. Most studies had a high risk of bias. Three studies showed a small overestimation of BP measured over a sleeve, but the remaining 10 studies did not find statistically significant differences between measurements. Meta-analysis showed a nonsignificant 0.59mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to +1.30; P = 0.10] overestimation of SBP measured over a sleeve when the thinnest sleeve was considered for studies that investigated various thicknesses, a nonsignificant 1.10mmHg (95% CI -0.21 to +2.40; P = 0.10) overestimation of SBP when the thickest sleeve was considered, and a nonsignificant 2.76mmHg (95% CI -0.96 to +6.47; P = 0.15) overestimation of SBP measured below a rolled-up sleeve.

Conclusion

Measuring BP over a thick sleeve in the office may result in a small overestimation of recorded values but measuring over a thin sleeve does not appear to have a significant impact and, in any case, should be preferred to rolling it up.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^116r9ZjQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) prophylactic compression sleeves — The panel stated that prophylactic compression sleeves should be offered as an option for prevention, and clinicians should counsel that benefit beyond one year is uncertain; this is especially relevant for patients receiving axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) plus regional node irradiation where the peak to development is 18–24 months. Sleeves are relatively low cost, minimal risk, and readily available, and because some patients develop BCRAL within the first 6 months after surgery, prophylactic sleeves are a reasonable option for those wishing to minimise early risk.

### Superior hemodynamic performance of a thigh-length versus knee-length intermittent pneumatic compression device [^114Hspuz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

There is a lack of consensus regarding which length of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) device provides optimal thromboprophylaxis. This trial was conducted to compare hemodynamic performance of a thigh-length and knee-length IPC device. The hypothesis is that thigh-length IPC will be more efficient in preventing stasis.

Methods

This single-center trial tested the thigh-length sleeve (TLS) and knee-length sleeve (KLS) in 47 healthy volunteers. Peak systolic velocity and total volume flow were measured at rest and during the 11-second compression cycle. Measurements were obtained at the popliteal vein for the KLS and at the common femoral vein for the TLS.

Results

The study was completed by 47 volunteers (32 women, 15 men), who were a mean age of 39.7 years (range, 18–68 years). There was a statistically significant difference in augmented total volume flow and peak systolic velocity between the KLS and TLS favoring the TLS: median total volume flow was 357.54 mL/min for the KLS vs 668.21 mL/min for the TLS (P < .0001), and median peak systolic velocity was 47.70 cm/s for the KLS vs 58.47 cm/s for the TLS (P = 0.0019).

Conclusions

This trial suggests that the improved hemodynamic effects of a thigh-length IPC system may provide superior thromboprophylaxis to a knee-length IPC.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^115NxVM5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our Delphi consensus presented recommendations on the methods of detecting early BCRAL and thresholds to initiate treatment with compression sleeves in a surveillance program. We recognise that there is a significant heterogeneity in the methods of detection, thresholds for the respective methods and follow-up treatments (e.g. compression sleeves, congestive decompressive therapy, surgery) reported in the literature.BIS was one of the most frequently used methods of detection in the studies on surveillance programs. While assessments using BIS is non-invasive and quick, whether this method is more superior compared to other less expensive methods (e.g. perometry and tape measurements) in detecting early BCRAL warrants further study. In the PREVENT trial, patients were randomised to receive BCRAL surveillance by BIS or traditional tape measurement. At a median follow up of 32.9 months, interventions were triggered at a significantly lower rate in the BIS arm compared to the tape measurement arm (20.1% versus 27.5%, p = 0.001). The rates of progression of BCRAL in those who received interventions were lower in the BIS arm (7.9% versus 19.2% p = 0.016). Authors of the PREVENT trial stated that BIS was useful in identifying a group of patients who better benefit from early compression. Brunelle et al. questioned this conclusion as there was a lower rate of trigger in the BIS arm without any prior intervention, while previous studies reported that BIS tended to overestimate the incidence of BCRAL compared to other methods such as tape measurements and perometry. The lower rate of progression of BCRAL observed in the BIS arm could have been contributed by an imbalance of risk factors of BCRAL development in favour of the BIS arm. In the PREVENT trial, the BIS arm had more patients with stage I disease and less ALND performed compared to the tape measurement arm. Taking the above points into consideration, BIS should be considered an option for BCRAL screening, but not a standard of care following the publication of the PREVENT trial. Healthcare teams should select a detection method based on the cost, availability of the tool and experience of using it. Practitioners should remain flexible and carefully discuss with patients the pros and cons of initiating interventions when thresholds are met, taking into account whether patient has any symptoms and risk factors of BCRAL. With studies showing that the level of agreement across different tools are limited, patients with early BCRAL should be monitored with the same detection methods to assess whether the intervention is useful. It should also be highlighted that the studies validating these thresholds were predominantly performed in patients from North American and European countries. Further work is needed to align thresholds for patients of different racial backgrounds in order of generate accurate incidence and prevalence estimates in future clinical studies. Institutions adopting the thresholds recommended in this paper should regularly review how they reflect their local populations and make adjustments accordingly.

### The use of upper-body intermittent sequential pneumatic compression arm sleeves on recovery from exercise in wheelchair athletes [^112zeT4G]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of an upper-body intermittent sequential pneumatic compression device on recovery after wheelchair team sport activity.

Design

Eleven well-trained wheelchair basketball and rugby athletes (male, 8; female, 3; mean ± SD age = 33 ± 10 yrs) performed a series of performance measures pre-exercise, postexercise, and postrecovery (grip strength, pressure-to-pain threshold, medicine ball throw, wheelchair sprints, repeated sprints). Subjective muscle soreness and fatigue measurements were taken at the same time points as performance tests, with an additional 24-hr postrecovery measure. Participants completed two recovery trials, separated by 1 wk, of either passive recovery (control) or 20 mins of wearing recovery arm sleeves (intermittent sequential pneumatic compression) applied to both arms.

Results

No statistically significant differences were found between trials for any of the performance or perceptual measures (P > 0.05). However, effect size analysis revealed a moderate decrease (d = -0.67) from postexercise to postrecovery for muscle fatigue in favor of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression. A large decrease (d = -0.96) in muscle soreness was also found after exercise to 24 hrs after recovery in favor of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression over control.

Conclusions

Intermittent sequential pneumatic compression may provide some benefit for perceptual recovery measures immediately after and 24 hrs after a high-intensity wheelchair activity with negligible effects on performance recovery.

### Prophylactic use of compression sleeves reduces the incidence of arm swelling in women at high risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial… [^114Q311m]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results P = 0.004) on the basis of BIS and 0. 56 on the basis of RAVI. The estimated cumulative incidence of arm swelling at 1 year was lower in the compression group than the control group on the basis of BIS from the arm on the nonsurgical side, ie, unaffected arm, by the impedance from the side of surgery, ie, at-risk arm arm volume differences between the at-risk and unaffected arms were then calculated, 31and cases in which the relative arm volume increased ≥ 10% from baseline were identified. Results Arm Swelling on the Basis of BIS Pvalue = 0.004). The estimated cumulative incidence of arm swelling at 1 year on the basis of BIS was 42% in the compression group compared with 52% in the control group. Arm Swelling on the Basis of Relative Arm Volume Increase Pvalue = 0.034). The estimated cumulative incidence of arm swelling at 1 year was 14% in the compression group compared with 25% in the control group. 42, 47and to address gravitational forces that occur while in the upright position. 48These parameters appeared to be well tolerated, as indicated by the lack of any negative effect on patient-reported outcomes, including arm symptoms.

Whether the level of compression and duration it is worn can be reduced and still obtain similar outcomes will need to be explored with future research. 41, 42The prophylactic use of compression sleeves reduced the incidence of arm swelling to the clinically meaningful target, ie, a reduction of 10% set a priori.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^111rHvdZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Overall, we found no impact of the compression sleeve on mean blood flow or SR. Previous work on this topic found that external compression on a limb leads to a decrease (40 to 84 mm Hg compression), 41 no change (≈37 mm Hg compression), 42 or increase (13 to 23 mm Hg compression) 43 in resting limb blood flow. The conflicting results may relate to differences in techniques, protocols, populations, types of garment, and the range and duration of compression levels. The level of compression may also importantly alter the magnitude and direction of blood flow change. Although these previous results do not provide definitive answers to the effects of compression in these pressure ranges on blood flow to the limb, these data suggest that the effect of external compression on a limb may differ, dependent on the protocol adopted.

In line with previous findings, 12 we observed a decrease in FMD after 30 minutes of exposure to elevated levels of retrograde SR in young men. We extend this knowledge by the finding that after 2 weeks of chronic exposure to elevated levels of retrograde SR, FMD was still impaired. However, the impairment of endothelial function after 30 minutes showed no further decrease when the compression sleeve was worn for 2 weeks. This finding of a decrease in endothelial function after prolonged exposure to retrograde SR is in agreement with a previous ex vivo study in pig carotid arteries, where 3 days of increased retrograde SR induced a decrease in endothelial function, accompanied with a decrease in eNOS expression. 44 During the 2‐weeks postintervention measurements of endothelial function, we did not remove the compression sleeve (because of practical reasons). This might have influenced our measurements. However, since the sleeve did not acutely alter the SR area‐under‐the‐curve and/or resting diameter (Tables 2 and 3), we believe it unlikely that the compression sleeve impacted our main findings.

### Preventing early postoperative arm swelling and lymphedema manifestation by compression sleeves after axillary lymph node interventions in breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial [^114ikJGS]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Breast cancer-related lymphedema (LE) remains one of the major long-term complications after surgery. Many reports showed the effectiveness of compression in breast cancer-related LE treatment, but randomized controlled trials evaluating compression garments for postoperative prevention are lacking.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of light arm compression sleeves for reducing the incidence of early postoperative swelling and of breast cancer-related arm LE.

Methods

A total of 45 women were pre-operatively randomly assigned to a group with compression of circular-knit sleeves in compression class I (15–21 mm Hg) for daily wearing (compression group [CG]; n = 23) or to a control group without compression (no CG, n = 22). Both groups underwent a standardized physical exercise program. Arm volumes were measured before surgery and one, three, six, nine, and 12 months thereafter.

Results

At one month, postoperative swelling was reduced only in CG. After 12 months, the average change of excess volumes (edema) reached -67.6 mL in the CG vs. +114.5 mL in the no CG (P < 0.001). Significantly less edema was seen in the CG after three, six, nine, and 12 months. No significant difference between groups in health-related quality of life (measured by EORTC QLQ-C30) was observed.

Conclusion

Fifteen to 21 mm Hg compression sleeves in combination with physical activity may be a safe and efficient option to prevent postsurgical arm swelling and development of LE.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^111cZnav]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) — epidemiology and prevention evidence: BCRAL is a common complication experienced in up to one in five breast cancer patients after anti-cancer treatments, and about 50% of patients with BCRAL develop this condition 12–30 months after surgery; chronic lymphoedema is irreversible, difficult to treat and significantly affects health-related quality of life. Prospective surveillance programs have been developed and tested in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that such programs were successful in reducing the incidence of chronic BCRAL, although significant heterogeneity exists in surveillance intervals, durations, detection methods, and subsequent interventions. Beyond surveillance, a RCT of 307 patients showed that prophylactic compression sleeves applied after surgery were effective in delaying and reducing the incidence of arm swelling in patients who had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and prophylactic lymphatic reconstruction and axillary reverse mapping were also shown to be effective in preventing BCRAL in systematic reviews.

### Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment [^1119puNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than one in five patients who undergo treatment for breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL can occur as a result of breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy. BCRL can negatively impact comfort, function, and quality of life (QoL). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a type of hands-on therapy, is frequently used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is a fourfold conservative treatment which includes MLD, compression therapy (consisting of compression bandages, compression sleeves, or other types of compression garments), skin care, and lymph-reducing exercises (LREs). Phase 1 of CDT is to reduce swelling; Phase 2 is to maintain the reduced swelling.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of MLD in treating BCRL.

Search Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform), and Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register from root to 24 May 2013. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with BCRL. The intervention was MLD. The primary outcomes were (1) volumetric changes, (2) adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (1) function, (2) subjective sensations, (3) QoL, (4) cost of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on three volumetric outcomes. (1) LE (lymphedema) volume was defined as the amount of excess fluid left in the arm after treatment, calculated as volume in mL of affected arm post-treatment minus unaffected arm post-treatment. (2) Volume reduction was defined as the amount of fluid reduction in mL from before to after treatment calculated as the pretreatment LE volume of the affected arm minus the post-treatment LE volume of the affected arm. (3) Per cent reduction was defined as the proportion of fluid reduced relative to the baseline excess volume, calculated as volume reduction divided by baseline LE volume multiplied by 100. We entered trial data into Review Manger 5.2 (RevMan), pooled data using a fixed-effect model, and analyzed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also explored subgroups to determine whether mild BCRL compared to moderate or severe BCRL, and BCRL less than a year compared to more than a year was associated with a better response to MLD.

Main Results

Six trials were included. Based on similar designs, trials clustered in three categories.(1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy (one trial) showed significant improvements in both groups from baseline but no significant between-groups differences for per cent reduction.(2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging (two trials) showed significant per cent reductions of 30% to 38.6% for compression bandaging alone, and an additional 7.11% reduction for MLD (MD 7.11%, 95% CI 1.75% to 12.47%; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.06). LE volume was not significant. Subgroup analyses was significant showing that participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL were better responders to MLD than were moderate-to-severe participants.(3) MLD + compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment + compression therapy (three trials) were too varied to pool. One of the trials compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus pneumatic pump. Volume reduction was statistically significant favoring MLD (MD 47.00 mL, 95% CI 15.25 mL to 78.75 mL; 1 RCT; 24 participants), per cent reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.07), and LE volume was not significant. A second trial compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus self-administered simple lymphatic drainage (SLD), and was significant for MLD for LE volume (MD -230.00 mL, 95% CI -450.84 mL to -9.16 mL; 1 RCT; 31 participants) but not for volume reduction or per cent reduction. A third trial of MLD + compression bandaging versus SLD + compression bandaging was not significant (P = 0.10) for per cent reduction, the only outcome measured (MD 11.80%, 95% CI -2.47% to 26.07%, 28 participants).MLD was well tolerated and safe in all trials. Two trials measured function as range of motion with conflicting results. One trial reported significant within-groups gains for both groups, but no between-groups differences. The other trial reported there were no significant within-groups gains and did not report between-groups results. One trial measured strength and reported no significant changes in either group. Two trials measured QoL, but results were not usable because one trial did not report any results, and the other trial did not report between-groups results. Four trials measured sensations such as pain and heaviness. Overall, the sensations were significantly reduced in both groups over baseline, but with no between-groups differences. No trials reported cost of care. Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results.

Authors' Conclusions

MLD is safe and may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for swelling reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate-to-severe BCRL, those with mild-to-moderate BCRL may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by randomized data. In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared with a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial. Research is needed to identify the most clinically meaningful volumetric measurement, to incorporate newer technologies in LE assessment, and to assess other clinically relevant outcomes such as fibrotic tissue formation. Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), and inconclusive for quality of life. For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, 60% to 80% of participants reported feeling better regardless of which treatment they received. One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^115pQxcD]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This expert panel recommended that prophylactic compression sleeves should be offered to patients as an option for the prevention of BCRAL. Consensus was achieved in the second round when the statement was amended that this intervention should be offered as an "option". Experts who disagreed reflected that the results from a single RCT should not be generalised for routine practice. Panel members also commented that the follow-up time of one year in the same study was not adequate to reflect its longer-term efficacy for preventing BCRAL. Healthcare professionals offering compression sleeves should counsel patients that the benefit of the intervention in preventing BCRAL that develops beyond one year is uncertain. This point should be especially emphasized to patients who receive both ALND and regional lymph node irradiation, as the peak to development of BCRAL in this group of patients is 18–24 months. Future RCTs should be performed with a longer follow-up to confirm the conclusions of the study. Nevertheless, compression sleeves are relatively low cost, associated with minimal risk and readily available. As some patients can develop BCRAL as early as within the first 6 months after surgery, prophylactic compression sleeves is a reasonable option for patients who wish to minimise the risk of early BCRAL. Real world, pragmatic studies are needed to understand patient uptake in the use of sleeves and whether there are any issues with sleeve fitness that may compromise efficacy, as these practical aspects were not reported in the RCT. Studies are also needed to test whether different types of sleeves (e.g. flat knit sleeves instead of circular-knit sleeves that was used in the trial) or adjusting the schedule of wearing the sleeves could further enhance their efficacy, as a proportion of patients still developed BCRAL in the experimental arm.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^1112eDqt]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview: Study 2

A total of 14 recreationally active participants (Table 1) reported to the laboratory on two separate occasions. The first session was a familiarization trial of the treadmill running protocol, in which participants performed a 9-min treadmill (Instrumented Tandem Treadmill; Advanced Medical Equipment Inc. MA) running bout (3 min at 8 km·h −1, 3 min at 10 km·h −1, and 3 min at 12 km·h −1) with the Vicon markers in place (discussed below). Also during this session, a series of girth and skinfold measurements were performed on the dominant lower limb (as described in study 1). Approximately 48 h after the familiarization, participants again reported to the laboratory for the main testing session. This session followed a within-subject crossover design, in which participants completed 4 × 9-min continuous treadmill running trials separated by 30 min of passive rest. Trials were performed under four conditions: 1) a no-compression control (CON 2; loose-fitting running shorts); 2) 2XU MCS Compression Tights (2XU, Melbourne, Australia), composed of 72%/28% (front) and 65%/35% nylon and elastene (back); 3) Nike Pro Zonal Compression Tights (Nike, Beaverton, OR), composed of 83%/17% (body/center-front lining) and 84%/16% (mesh) polyester and elastene; or Under Armor (UA) Charged Compression Tights (Under Armor, Baltimore, MD), composed of 78%/22% polyester and elastene. These garments were chosen for their targeted support of lower limb muscles during exercise and covered the participant's lower limb from waist to ankle. Garments were fitted according to manufacture guidelines (i.e. height and weight for 2XU, and waist and hip circumference for Nike and UA). Participants performed all running trials wearing the same running shoes.

### Interest of an auto-adjustable nighttime compression sleeve (MOBIDERM® autofit) in maintenance phase of upper limb lymphedema: the MARILYN pilot RCT [^113t6vRp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study evaluating the effects of the nighttime auto-adjustable MOBIDERM® Autofit arm sleeve in women with BCRL who had just completed intensive phase of DLT. We observed a different variation of lymphedema volume between the two groups in favor of the night-use group. In the ITT population, the lymphedema volume variation from Day 0 to Day 30 (relative median, primary efficacy endpoint) was lower in patients fitted with MOBIDERM® Autofit (night use group) vs. the no night-use group (1.8 vs. 3.2%, respectively). The introduction during the first 30 nights of Autofit in night-use group patients, a critical period following intensive phase of DLT associated with high risk of lymphedema volume increase, should have limited maintenance phase failure, as compared to no night-use group patients treated without night device.

From Day 30 to Day 90, when all patients were fitted with the auto-adjustable MOBIDERM® Autofit arm sleeve during the night, the lymphedema volume remained stable in both groups, suggesting that the device allowed stabilization of the lymphedema volume as soon as it is putted on. Interestingly, this stabilization observed in night-use group is associated with improvement of the functional symptoms as well as the function as assessed by the patients.

High quality compressive garments are important to maintain and optimize the volume reduction achieved during the intensive phase of DLT. Long term and consistent use of garments or bandages during the night are encouraged by ILF. Vignes et al. showed that women who wore a daytime compression sleeve associated with nighttime low-stretch compression bandages had a significantly reduced risk of relapse in arm lymphedema volume. However, self-bandaging remain a difficult process for patients, especially for arm. In addition, multilayers bandages composition varies widely (number of layers, type of material, number of overlaps) and the final quality is operator-dependent. Our results showed that MOBIDERM® Autofit night sleeve can stabilize lymphedema volume during the first 3 months of the maintenance phase and improve some domains of quality of life and functional symptoms as an add-on treatment.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^116tM7u8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) prevention guidance — implementation considerations and residual risk: Interventions recommended in this Delphi consensus do not guarantee complete prevention and only reduce risk, and in cited trials 14% of patients in the prophylactic compression sleeve group had relative arm volume increase at 1 year compared to 25% in the non-sleeve group. Prospective surveillance programs may add financial costs and time burden to patients, though a home-based surveillance program utilizing BIS was shown to be well-accepted by patients and feasible, and prophylactic compression sleeves likewise may not be accepted by some patients. For ongoing implementation, institutions that are already implementing these measures should regularly collect patient feedback to improve care and consider alternative interventions if patients are not complying with them, and the international community should be ready to regularly monitor for updates and review whether the recommended interventions remain effective, with an update of this Delphi study proposed in 5–10 years. Economic considerations include that implementing prospective surveillance and early intervention was estimated to require less costs than traditional methods for treating patients with late stage BCRAL, but if incidence declines the number needed to treat may significantly increase and such programs may be less cost effective. Consensus robustness is noted as there were still at least 30 experts who rated each of the statements.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^115Fe5TQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

All bandaging was performed by the same physical therapist, who had already received lymphedema therapist training in Japan, so that sub-bandage pressure at the calf was maintained around 40 mmHg using the Kikuhime™ pressure sensor (TT Meditrade, Sorø, Denmark), which can measure the sub-bandage pressure of bandages.

Active exercise was then performed using the training mode of the Strength Ergo™240 bicycle ergometer. Exercise intensity was set at 10% of the maximum extension muscular strength of the lower limb as evaluated at baseline for high-load AECT and 5% for low-load AECT. Anaerobic threshold (AT) is one of the indices of exercise intensity, and energy supply is provided by aerobic mechanisms at less than AT. A previous study using the Strength Ergo™240 bicycle ergometer showed that muscular extension strength of the lower limb required in AT was approximately 12% of the maximum extension muscular strength of the lower limb. Exercise intensities were thus set at 10 and 5% of the maximum extension muscular strength of the lower limb (i.e. less than AT) so that all participants would be able to perform the exercise. The position of the seat was adjusted according to height and sitting height, so that activity of the gluteal muscles did not exceed that of the lower limbs. Participants were instructed to pedal the ergometer at 50 revolutions/min for 15 min. Exercise duration varied from 15 to 60 min in previous studies. As patients with LLL may not be able to continue exercise for that long, the duration of exercise was set at 15 min in the present study.

During CT, participants were instructed to maintain a sitting position for 15 min.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^111oc24N]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Active exercise with compression therapy (AECT) is a standard treatment for gynecological cancer-related lower-limb lymphedema (LLL) in clinical situations. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the immediate effects of the use of AECT on LLL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of AECT on LLL.

Methods

Participants in this randomized controlled crossover trial comprised 23 women with LLL who completed high-load AECT, low-load AECT, and compression-only therapy (CT). AECT was performed on a bicycle ergometer with short stretch bandages. Each intervention was performed for 15 min, with successive interventions separated by a 1-week washout period. Lower-limb volume was assessed using a Perometer™ sensor (Pero-system, Wuppertal, Germany). General symptoms (pain and heaviness) and skin symptoms (pitting and stiffness) were assessed using a visual analog scale and palpation, respectively. Measurements were taken before and after each intervention. Analysis of variance using linear mixed-effect modeling was used for statistical analyses.

Results

Volume decrement differed significantly between all three interventions (P < 0.05). Lower-limb volume was significantly reduced after high-load AECT compared to that after CT. General symptoms and skin symptoms were similar across the three interventions, but severity of pre-intervention skin symptoms correlated significantly with volume decrement after high- and low-load AECT. High-load AECT using the bicycle ergometer was more effective than CT for decreasing lower-limb volume.

Conclusions

These results suggest that high-load AECT has marked effects on severe LLL.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^1156nH2r]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants

A total of 27 recreationally active male participants were recruited across two separate studies (Table 1). The first study investigated the effects of commercially available compression tights on thigh and calf muscle movement during treadmill running. This study aimed to investigate whether compression garments reduce lower limb muscle movement, as measured by 3D motion capture technology. The second study expanded on the first study by investigating the effects of three different commercially available compression tights on thigh and calf muscle movement, as well as soft tissue vibrations, muscle activation, and running economy, during treadmill running. Sample sizes (both studies) were calculated from previously reported changes in anterior–posterior thigh muscle displacement (compression vs no compression) during drop jumps. Written informed consent was obtained before participation, and all participants were screened for cardiovascular risk factors that may increase the risk of an adverse event occurring during exercise. All procedures were approved by the Australian Institute of Sport (study 1) and Victoria University (study 2) Human Research Ethics Committees.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^111VthvK]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview: Study 1

A total of 13 amateur Australian-Rules footballers (Table 1) reported to the laboratory on two separate occasions. The first session was a familiarization trial of the treadmill running protocol, in which participants performed a 4-min treadmill (Trackmaster TMX 55; Full Vision Inc. Newton, KS) running bout (2 min at 12 km·h −1 and 2 min at 15 km·h −1) with the Vicon markers in place (discussed below). Also during this session, a series of girth and skinfold measurements were performed on the dominant lower limb to provide anthropometric characterization of the participants' lower limb, performed according to the international standard for anthropometric measurements. With the subjects standing, an Executive steel tape measure (Lufkin Executive; Apex Tool Group, Albury, NSW, Australia) was used to measure the midthigh and calf girth measurements. In addition, skinfold calipers (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper; Baty International, West Sussex, UK) were used to measure midthigh and medical calf skinfolds.

Approximately 48 h after the familiarization, participants again reported to the laboratory for the main testing session. This session followed a within-subject crossover design, in which participants completed two 4-min treadmill running bouts separated by 30 min of passive rest. Participants performed the treadmill running bouts under two conditions, a no-compression control (CON 1; loose-fitting running shorts) and with compression tights (COMP; 2XU Elite Tights, Melbourne, Australia) covering the lower limb from waist to ankle. Garment fabric was composed of 72%/28% (front) and 65%/35% nylon and elastane (back) and were fitted according to manufacture guidelines (i.e. height and weight). Participants performed both running trials wearing the same running shoes. The order in which participants performed these conditions was randomized and counterbalanced for the first 12 participants, with the 13th participant performing the CON 1 condition first and the COMP condition second. All participants were asked to be well fed (last meal < 2 h) and hydrated, and to refrain from strenuous exercise (< 24 h) and caffeine (< 12 h), before the main testing session, which was verified by a 24-h training and dietary recall. During each trial, thigh and calf muscle movement was measured (as detailed below).

### Reply to "Comment on: increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study" [^1113wbw4]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Another aim of the research was to define whether increase in BIS or RAVI would be a better predictor of the development of clinical lymphedema and select patients for screening and earlier treatment intervention. RAVI was the better predictor.

Amongst participants whose BIS change was > 5 but < 10 at 6 months post-surgery, only 19% went on to develop lymphoedema by 24 months (see Table 2) whereas for those with a RAVI 4–9% it was 43%. Of those with a BIS > 10 increase (BIS diagnostic criterion for lymphoedema) at 6 months only 33% of participants subsequently developed lymphoedema by 24 months, indicating that BIS is neither sensitive, specific nor predictive of lymphedema.

Several other studies – have found BIS changes do not predict lymphoedema.

The Quality of Life data showed that unless the individual has a RAVI > 5% and clinical symptoms, applying a compression sleeve did not improve quality of life or prevent lymphedema.

Evidence that early detection and intervention prevents clinical lymphoedema is poor. Recent randomised trials of early intervention with either manual lymphatic drainage or compression sleeves in women with RAVI 4–9% arm increases, found no benefit of either treatment on lymphoedema development. In the absence of effective interventions, the value of screening for a condition is debatable.

The main results focus on the follow-up at 24 months which is the time by which > 90% of BCRL develops. The data presented does not include all follow-up to 5 years as the data census was carried out before all participants had reached this stage. The percentage with data available at 24 months was 49.5%. Inevitably, the percentage of participants still being followed at five years will be lower. However, we believe that the numbers at each time point are sufficiently large and this does not affect the main study findings.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of exercise therapy for venous leg ulcer healing and recurrence [^111TnJhy]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

National guidelines in the United Kingdom have recommended regular exercise for individuals with venous leg ulceration. However, data on the effects of exercise on ulcer healing and recurrence are sparse. In the present study, we aimed to quantify the evidence for exercise regarding venous ulcer healing with respect to the primary outcomes of the proportion of healed ulcers and rate of ulcer recurrence. The secondary outcomes were improvement in ulcer symptoms, ulcer healing time, quality of life, compliance, and adverse events reported.

Methods

The review followed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines using a registered protocol (CRD42021220925). The MEDLINE and Embase databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials, and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registries were searched up to April 6, 2022 and included studies comparing exercise therapy and compression vs compression alone. Data for the proportion of healed ulcers were pooled using a fixed effects meta-analysis.

Results

After screening 1046 reports, 7 were included, with 121 participants allocated to exercise therapy and 125 to compression alone. All the reports were of randomized controlled trials and had reported ulcer healing at 12 weeks, with a pooled relative risk of ulcer healing of 1.38 for exercise vs compression (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.71). Only one study had reported on recurrence; thus, data pooling was not performed. No differences between exercise and usual care were demonstrated. Compliance with exercise ranged from 33% to 81%. The included studies demonstrated low enrollment and a high risk of bias. Also, most of the trials had failed to demonstrate any differences in activity completed between the intervention and control arms.

Conclusions

A paucity of studies has examined leg ulcer recurrence after exercise programs, with no evidence to show that exercise is beneficial. Furthermore, the quality of evidence supporting exercise as an adjunct to ulcer healing is very low, and the trials demonstrated serious methodologic flaws, chiefly in recording the activity undertaken by the participants in the intervention arm. Future randomized controlled trials should implement activity monitoring and standardize the reporting of key patient, ulcer, and reflux characteristics to enable future meaningful meta-analyses to determine the role of exercise as an adjunct to venous leg ulceration healing.

### Pre-cooling for endurance exercise performance in the heat: a systematic review [^112g1vxo]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Cooling garment

Cooling garments primarily reduce skin temperature. Common strategies include wearing a vest that covers the torso with pockets for ice packs (ice vest), or wearing a waist-length polyester blend shell with sleeves and a hood that has a phase change material sewn in (cooling jacket). Kay et al. suggested that lowering skin temperature without a concomitant reduction in core body temperature prior to exercise, increasing the thermal gradient between core and skin, afforded participants a lower core temperature during exercise due to increased core to skin heat loss.

Although there is a significant body of work regarding pre-cooling and its effects on athletic performance, the literature concerning pre-cooling for endurance exercise performance has yet to be reviewed systematically and it is yet to be established which pre-cooling modality or mechanism of body cooling is the most effective. Two reviews provide comprehensive descriptions of pre-cooling and its application to sports performance. However, neither combined available data to systematically analyze or compare different pre-cooling strategies. The conclusions drawn are therefore more open to bias than those of a systematic review and comparisons of methods subjective. Furthermore, both reviews were published before more recent pre-cooling strategies such as ice slurry ingestion had been investigated and reported on. Therefore, a more up-to-date evidence-based review, less open to bias is warranted.

Recently, Ranalli et al. evaluating the effect of body cooling on aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance, concluded that pre-cooling conferred limited benefit to intermittent or anaerobic exercise performance. For the 'aerobic' section of the review, they included nine studies, yet only two of these studies evaluated cooling prior to exercise (pre-cooling). Considering practical limitations to cooling during competition for many sports, and the number of additional studies evaluating the effects of pre-cooling on endurance exercise performance in the literature, a systematic review of all studies where participants were cooled prior to exercise is required. Therefore, the aims of this systematic review were to (i) summarize the effectiveness of different pre-cooling procedures to improve endurance exercise performance by comparing, critiquing and combining results from each study; (ii) enable evidence-based decisions on appropriate pre-cooling athlete management to be made; and (iii) provide guidance for future research evaluating the efficacy of pre-cooling strategies which aim to enhance endurance exercise performance.

### Compression garments reduce muscle movement and activation during submaximal running [^111V9tLN]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of sports compression tights in reducing muscle movement and activation during running.

Methods

A total of 27 recreationally active males were recruited across two separate studies. For study 1, 13 participants (mean ± SD = 84.1 ± 9.4 kg, 22 ± 3 yr) completed two 4-min treadmill running bouts (2 min at 12 and 15 km·h) under two conditions: a no-compression control (CON1) and compression (COMP). For study 2, 14 participants (77.8 ± 8.4 kg, 27 ± 5 yr) completed four 9-min treadmill running bouts (3 min at 8, 10, and 12 km·h) under four conditions: a no-compression control (CON2) and three different commercially available compression tights (2XU, Nike, and Under Armor). Using Vicon 3D motion capture technology, lower limb muscle displacement was investigated in both study 1 (thigh and calf) and study 2 (vastus lateralis + medialis [VAS]; lateral + medial gastrocnemius [GAS]). In addition, study 2 investigated the effects of compression on soft tissue vibrations (root-mean-square of resultant acceleration, RMS Ar), muscle activation (iEMG), and running economy (oxygen consumption, V˙O2) during treadmill running.

Results

Wearing compression during treadmill running reduced thigh and calf muscle displacement as compared with no compression (both studies), which was evident across all running speeds. Compression also reduced RMS Ar and iEMG during treadmill running, but it had no effect on running economy (study 2).

Conclusion

Lower limb compression garments are effective in reducing muscle displacement, soft tissue vibrations, and muscle activation associated with the impact forces experienced during running.

### The use of compression stockings during a marathon competition to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage: are they really useful? [^114Qs47x]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case-control study; ecological study.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of wearing compression stockings to prevent muscle damage and to maintain running performance during a marathon competition.

Background

Exercise-induced muscle damage has been identified as one of the main causes of the progressive decrease in running and muscular performance found during marathon races.

Methods

Thirty-four experienced runners were pair-matched for age, anthropometric data, and best race time in the marathon, and randomly assigned to a control group (n = 17) of runners who wore conventional socks or to a group of runners who wore foot-to-knee graduated compression stockings (n = 17). Before and after the race, a sample of venous blood was obtained, and jump height and leg muscle power were measured during a countermovement jump. Serum myoglobin and creatine kinase concentrations were determined as blood markers of muscle fiber damage.

Results

Total race time was not different between the control group and the compression stockings group (210 ± 23 and 214 ± 22 minutes, respectively; p = 0.58). Between the control group and the compression stockings group, postrace reductions in leg muscle power (-19.8% ± 17.7% versus -24.8% ± 18.4%, respectively; p = 0.37) and jump height (-25.3% ± 14.1% versus -32.5%. 20.4%, respectively; p = 0.27) were similar. At the end of the race, there were no differences between the control group and the compression stockings group in serum myoglobin (568 ± 347 ng·mL(-1) versus 573 ± 270 ng·mL(-1), respectively; p = 0.97) and creatine kinase concentration (390 ± 166 U·L(-1) versus 487 ± 227 U·L(-1), respectively; p = 0.16).

Conclusion

The use of compression stockings did not improve running pace and did not prevent exercise-induced muscle damage during the marathon. Wearing compression stockings during long-distance running events is an ineffective strategy to avoid the deleterious effects of muscle damage on running performance.

Level Of Evidence

Therapy, level 2b.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^117VZchF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Impact of Retrograde Shear: Young Men

Retrograde shear intervention

In the intervention arm, we found a significant "time"‐effect for retrograde SR, with post‐hoc analysis revealing an increase in retrograde SR after 30 minutes and 2 weeks (P = 0.004). Changes in antegrade SR across time in the intervention arm did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.068, Table 2).

Table 2
Brachial Artery SR, Diameter, and FMD% at Baseline and After 30 Minutes and 2 Weeks of Forearm Compression in Young Healthy Men (n = 13)

Brachial artery FMD% and diameter

We also observed that, as a result of the increase in retrograde SR, brachial artery FMD% was significantly lower after both 30 minutes and 2 weeks in the intervention arm (P = 0.004, Figure). While the 30‐minute compression sleeve intervention did not alter resting diameter, we observed a significant decrease in brachial artery diameter after 2 weeks of wearing the compression sleeve (P = 0.035, Figure). The decrease in FMD% after 2 weeks wearing the compression sleeve showed a weak but significant correlation with a priori FMD% in young participants (r = −0.59, P = 0.03). In the contralateral arm, we observed no change in brachial artery antegrade or retrograde SR or FMD% (P = 0.19, 0.32, and 0.26, respectively, Table 2). Diameter showed a small, significant decrease after 2 weeks of wearing the compression sleeve in the intervention arm (P = 0.005, Table 2).

### Resistance training and lymphedema in breast cancer survivors [^112CPioK]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

In total, 115 women completed 1 of 3 studies; 5 (4%) were Black and 110 (96%) were White. Adherence was high, with 10 participants (9%) not meeting threshold and a mean (SD) of 3.17 (3.15) missed days per participant. Median (range) age was 54 (24–71) years, and 15 women (13%) had clinical lymphedema at study enrollment based on arm measurements (Table 2); 8 (8%) in the SLNB group and 7 (37%) in the ALND group. Of note, 5 patients within the ALND group underwent initial SLNB and returned to the operating room for full axillary dissection. Four patients underwent bilateral surgery, limiting contralateral arm comparison assessments; thus, fluid assessment was reported for 111 participants (Table 3). Use of compression sleeves was recorded, with 13 of 15 patients (85%) with clinical lymphedema using them regularly, whereas the remaining 2 (13%) declined sleeve use due to discomfort. None of the participants underwent surgical treatment for existing lymphedema during the study period. One participant underwent a lymphovenous anastomosis procedure, and another underwent lymph node transfer, both prior to initiating the exercise regimen.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^115qesUi]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) — prophylactic compression sleeves: For patients at high risk who wish to consider sleeves, the sleeves should be applied from the first post- operative day until 3 months after the completion of adjuvant treatments (excluding hormonal treatments). Daily use is suggested to be at least 8 h with individualized duration, and the pressure should be reviewed regularly and adjusted to patients' risks and needs. While using sleeves, patients should be assessed every 6 months for lymphoedema using bioimpedance testing and relative volume measurements, and clinical lymphoedema diagnosed by bioimpedance testing or an increase in relative arm volume by ≥ 10% should trigger subsequent treatments.

Fistula hand-arm exercise (CPG 3.2.3) states that strengthening the forearm with isometric exercises to increase handgrip strength (for example, squeezing a rubber ball with or without a lightly applied tourniquet) may increase blood flow, has been shown to significantly increase forearm vessel size, and thereby potentially increases flow through a fistula; additional noted effects include enhanced vein prominence, decreased superficial fat, and that correction of anemia could increase cardiac output and decrease peripheral resistance, potentially increasing fistula flow.

### Prescribed exercise with compression vs compression alone in treating patients with venous leg ulcers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bmACw]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Exercise is recommended as an adjuvant treatment for venous leg ulceration (VLU) to improve calf muscle pump function. However, the association of exercise with VLU healing has not been properly aggregated, and the effectiveness of different exercise interventions has not been characterized.

Objective

To summarize the association of different exercise interventions with VLU healing when used as an adjuvant to any form of compression.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched through October 9, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of any exercise compared with no exercise in participants with VLU were included, where compression was used as standard therapy and a healing outcome was reported. Independent title screening and full text review by 2 authors (A.J. J.S.) with appeal to a third author (J.P.) if disagreement was unresolved. Of the 519 articles screened, a total of 6 (1.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria for systematic review, including 5 for meta-analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent quality assessment for Cochrane risk of bias and data extraction by 2 authors with appeal to third author if disagreement unresolved (PRISMA). Data pooled using fixed effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The a priori primary outcome was any healing outcome (proportion healed, time to healing, or change in ulcer area). Secondary outcomes (adverse events, costs, and health-related quality of life) were only collected if a primary outcome was reported.

Results

Six RCTs were identified and 5 (190 participants) met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The exercise interventions were progressive resistance exercise alone (2 RCTs, 53 participants) or combined with prescribed physical activity (2 RCTs, 102 participants), walking only (1 RCT, 35 participants), or ankle exercises (1 RCT, 40 participants). Overall, exercise was associated with increased VLU healing at 12 weeks although the effect was imprecise (additional 14 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 1–27 cases per 100; p = 0.04). The combination of progressive resistance exercise plus prescribed physical activity appeared to be most effective, again with imprecision (additional 27 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 9–45 cases per 100; p = 0.004).

Conclusions and Relevance

The evidence base may now be sufficiently suggestive for clinicians to consider recommending simple progressive resistance and aerobic activity to suitable patients with VLU while further research is produced.

### Compression garments and recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage: a meta-analysis [^114feX5H]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of compression garments on recovery following damaging exercise. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using studies that evaluated the efficacy of compression garments on measures of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), muscular strength, muscular power and creatine kinase (CK). Studies were extracted from a literature search of online databases. Data were extracted from 12 studies, where variables were measured at baseline and at 24 or 48 or 72h postexercise. Analysis of pooled data indicated that the use of compression garments had a moderate effect in reducing the severity of DOMS (Hedges' g = 0.403, 95% CI 0.236 to 0.569, p < 0.001), muscle strength (Hedges' g = 0.462, 95% CI 0.221 to 0.703, p < 0.001), muscle power (Hedges' g = 0.487, 95% CI 0.267 to 0.707, p < 0.001) and CK (Hedges' g = 0.439, 95% CI 0.171 to 0.706, p < 0.001). These results indicate that compression garments are effective in enhancing recovery from muscle damage.

### Hip and knee bracing: categorization, treatment algorithm, and systematic review [^1166yfKy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleeve

Knee sleeves are very commonly used by patients with and without medical input. Knee sleeves can be used in acute injuries as part of rest, ice, and compression protocol or during symptomatic exacerbation of preexisting osteoarthritis. In addition, the knee sleeves can help reduce pain and dysfunction day-to-day or during sporting activities.

Knee sleeves do not provide any structural support; however, they do offer compression to potentially help prevent and reduce a joint effusion. In addition to general low-level symptomatic relief, they may also provide proprioceptive feedback. One example of a knee sleeve is the Neoprene Knee Sleeve 1 (Össur), shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13
Photograph showing the neoprene knee sleeve (Ӧssur Neoprene Knee Sleeve 1). These are usually the cheapest knee braces and can be easily purchased by patients. Neoprene knee sleeves come with a variety of options for the patella, including with or without patella relief (permission to use this photograph was received from Ӧssur, Reykjavík, Iceland).

Studies on athlete populations have shown that knee sleeves positively affect neuromuscular control by reducing knee flexion, abduction movement, and adduction moment. Other studies, such as that by Moon et alof 19 patients, used a musculoskeletal modeling analysis to demonstrate that sleeves do not reduce force transmission through the ACL, knee joint shear force, or internal rotation.

### Effect of pressure intensity of compression short-tight on fatigue of thigh muscles [^114Ndy9h]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Existing studies have failed to provide evidence of a positive effect on exercise performance by wearing compression short tights covering only both thighs. This could be due to an inadequate pressure intensity that otherwise has a significant effect if applied on the crucial point in the thigh. This study aimed to examine the effect of pressure intensity of elastic compression short-tights on the metabolic state of thigh muscles during submaximal running.

Methods

Two groups of 11 male subjects performed treadmill running at 12 km · h(-1) in three conditions in each of experiment 1 (short-tights with a compression intensity at the thigh of 8 mm Hg (LOW) and 15 mm Hg (MID) and noncompression shorts as control (CON1)) and experiment 2 (short-tights with 20 mm Hg (MID-HIGH) and 25 mm Hg (HIGH) and CON2). Before and immediately after the running exercises, T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the right thigh were obtained without testing garments. From the images, skeletal muscle proton transverse relaxation time (T2) of each muscle in the thigh was calculated.

Results

T2 was significantly increased after the treadmill running in all conditions in the hamstring and adductor muscles. In experiment 1, after the running, T2 elevation was significantly smaller in MID than that in CON1 for the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, adductor longus, and adductor magnus muscles. In experiment 2, after the running, T2 elevation was significantly lower in MID-HIGH than that in CON2 and HIGH for the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and adductor longus.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that wearing compression short tights with a pressure intensity of 15–20 mm Hg at the thigh can reduce development of fatigue of exercising muscles during submaximal running exercise in healthy adult males.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^111QxmVM]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

In a multicentre prospective study, women undergoing ANC for breast cancer from nine UK centres between July 2010 and May 2014 received pre-operative baseline arm measurements using perometry (RAVI, absolute arm circumference and volume changes) and BIS, then underwent follow-up measurements with both measurement techniques for 5 years.

The primary aim was to determine whether BIS (-Dex) had equal accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) as perometry for the detection of lymphoedema. Secondary aims were to determine the effect of diagnosis on quality-of-life, cancer survival and identify predictors of lymphoedema. The National Research Ethics Service Committee approved the study and informed consent was required for study participation.

The protocol (see supplementary data), predefined lymphoedema as a RAVI as equal to or > 10% relative arm volume increase upper arm or lower arm or both from baseline (compared to the contralateral arm). BIS criterion for diagnosis is a two or three standard deviation (sd) increase in BIS (-Dex increase > 7.5(2sd) or > 10(3sd). Impedimed), from baseline.

A mean of two arm measurements at each visit using a 350S Perometer with standard software (Pero System, Germany) reduced intra-observer variability. RAVI was calculated by a formula (see BEA Protocol in appendix), which allows for changes in the contralateral limb reducing the influence of arm dominance. Perometry provides arm volume and circumference measurements. Extracellular fluid was measured using the-DEX®U400 bioimpedance spectroscopy device from ImpediMed Ltd. Australia. Participants who developed lymphoedema (defined by RAVI > 10%) were prescribed a circular-knit compression-sleeve garment.

In cases when swelling of the lower arm, hand or symptoms (but RAVI < 10%) led to compression-sleeve application 20–25 mmHg (sleeves applied outside protocol indications) perometer readings and notes for patients with ipsilateral sleeve applied were reviewed. If the forearm had a RAVI > 10% increase, or if notes indicated hand oedema resulted in sleeve application, sleeve application was used as a clinical surrogate marker of lymphoedema. Time to lymphoedema (RAVI > 10% definition) are presented. RAVI and BIS changes were compared to determine, sensitivity and specificity, in lymphoedema diagnosis.

### Heavy-load lifting: acute response in breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema [^116Y9MYj]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise Sessions

All participants completed two familiarization sessions, followed by two experimental sessions (low- and heavy-load sessions) at exercise facilities located at the research center.

All resistance exercise sessions lasted approximately 30 min including a 10-min aerobic-based warm-up (rowing or cross-trainer) at low-moderate intensity. All sessions were supervised by the first author (K.B.) to ensure consistency of warm-up intensity and order of resistance exercises performed. None of the participants wore compression sleeves. During the first familiarization session, participants were introduced to four upper-extremity exercises consisting of the biceps curl performed with free weights, followed by the chest press, latissimus pull down, and triceps extension using resistance exercise machines (Technogym®, Gamettola, Italy). Hereafter, a 1RM strength test was performed in each exercise. During the second session, one set of 10–15 repetitions was performed, followed by a new 1RM strength test. Subsequent resistance exercise prescription during the experimental sessions was based on these values. After completion of the familiarization sessions, resistance exercise load order for the experimental sessions was randomly allocated (i.e. low or heavy load first) using a computer-generated random sequence (1/1 ratio). Women then participated in the experimental sessions, which entailed the 10-min aerobic-based warm-up, followed by the four resistance-based exercises. Resistance exercise load corresponded to 60%–65% 1RM (two sets of 15–20 repetitions) for the low-load session and 85%–90% 1RM (three sets of 5–8 repetitions) for the heavy-load session. Participants were instructed to work to muscle fatigue (until they were unable to maintain appropriate technique) within the prescribed range and with rest periods of 60–90 s between sets.

The experimental sessions were consistently performed on the same day of the week and at the same time of day, with all outcomes assessed before, immediately after (within 30 min), and 24 and 72 h after resistance exercise sessions. Blinded data collection was performed by medical technicians. Participants were instructed to maintain normal upper-body activities during the experimental period and to refrain from extraordinary activities involving the upper extremities.

### Exercise and cancer-related lymphedema in the lower limbs-a randomized cross-over trial on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with and without compression garments [^113YSzWE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The best practice document on LE management from the International Lymphedema Framework (ILF) recommends that patients with LE apply compression during exercise, which is supported by The National Lymphedema Network. However, patients with LE may find it embarrassing or uncomfortable to wear compression garments during exercise, and this may prevent them from exercising. Singh et al. were only able to include four studies investigating the use of compression during exercise in patients with ULL in a systematic review and could not provide solid recommendations for the use of compression during exercise. Consequently, the recommendations for the use of compression during exercise are not evidence-based.

The safety and ability to perform exercise for patients with LLL and the effect of compression during exercise remain to be investigated. Consequently, we performed a cross-over trial with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a stationary bike. The primary aim of our study was to investigate the acceptability and safety of the HIIT by adverse events and change in self-reported symptoms (pain, heaviness, and tension). The secondary aims were to explore recruitment, completion rate, and immediate effects on limb volume, soft tissue mass of the affected limb, and extracellular fluid in LLL.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^1113c8G3]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the specific ABPI values guiding what level of compression to use, there is abundant literature describing the types of compression materials and the way in which compression is applied. It was originally believed that "graduated compression" (with highest pressure applied at the ankle and gradually reduced toward the knee as the circumference of the limb increases toward the calf)was the proper method to apply compression based on Laplace's law, which defines pressures exerted on curved surfaces. However, Schuren and Mohr's workusing artificial legs and pressure transducers showed that using Laplace's law to calculate these values does not accurately predict sub-bandage pressures. None of the bandages they tested could provide dependable graduated compression. The widespread belief that correctly applied compression should provide 40 mmHg at the ankle and 17 mmHg below the knee in a graduated fashion is based solely on theoretical mathematical equations but is not supported by the results of experimental studies.

Schuren and Mohrlater demonstrated that the dynamics of effective compression therapy are explained by Pascal's Law: when a pressure is applied on a fluid (a muscle or muscle group) in a closed container (fascia muscularis and compression bandage), there is an equal increase at every other point in the container. Publications by others have later supported these concepts and debunked the dogmas and controversies in compression therapy. It is now believed that progressive compression (where lower ankle than calf pressure is applied) may be used to improve venous pump function for the treatment of venous ulceration at least in mobile patients and that it is as effective as traditional graduated compression and well tolerated in the presence of peripheral arterial disease.

Although there is a multitude of products available, compression bandages essentially come in two types: elastic and inelastic. Elastic bandages stretch and recoil back to their original length, exerting a sustained squeeze on the tissue. For this reason, they exert a high pressure during rest, but a low pressure during exercise because they stretch along with the expansion of the calf muscle. On the other hand, inelastic bandages form a rigid sleeve after application and exert a low resting pressure because they do not compress the leg any further once that rigid sleeve is formed. However, during exercise, the rigid sleeve provides resistance to the calf muscle expansion, creating a high working pressure.

### Evidence-based, high-intensity exercise and physical activity for compressing morbidity in older adults: a narrative review [^11559fKd]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

Moderate Intensity

However, even when performing high-intensity training, there still appears a need to perform some moderate-intensity training. A recent study focused on a different and quite important mechanism: arterial stiffness. With aging, there often are changes in the vascular system. Arterial stiffness is a thickening and stiffening of large elastic arteries. Arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular events and premature death. It was reported that moderate-intensity training improved arterial stiffness but high-intensity interval training did not show improvement. The investigators noted that it is not entirely clear what mechanisms would explain these different outcomes for moderate-intensity training and high-intensity interval training. However, the study's findings suggest that the mechanisms involved in improving fitness, in this study from high-intensity interval training, may not be the same mechanisms to improve arterial stiffness. The study points to middle-aged and older adults continuing physical activity outside of more intense training such as also brisk walking 20–30 minutes several times per week or any comparable activity. Arterial stiffness will be addressed again in later sections.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^114VBoGU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Statistics

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All data are reported as mean (SD) unless stated otherwise, while statistical significance was assumed at P ≤ 0.05. Separate statistical models were applied for young and older men. Changes in body characteristics between the pre‐ and postintervention measurement were tested using paired t tests. For diameter, SR, and FMD analysis, we adopted a 1‐way ANOVA to determine the impact of the sleeve intervention across time (baseline, 30 minutes, and 2 weeks; single factor) in both young and older men (as separate analyses). Post‐hoc t tests (with Least Square Difference correction for multiple comparisons) were performed when a main effect was found. Changes in brachial artery vascular function and diameter of the contralateral arm were examined using a paired t test since we have collected data before and after the 2‐week intervention only. According to a recent study, inadequate scaling for FMD% would be present if the upper confidence limit of the regression slope of the relationship between logarithmically transformed base diameter and peak diameter is < 1. 38 Accordingly, for the FMD% data only (both in young and older men), we performed an allometric modeling solution, 38 which employs a linear mixed‐models approach with "time" as fixed factor (baseline, 30 minutes, and 2 weeks), and the natural logarithm of the baseline diameter as a covariate. Baseline differences between groups were tested using unpaired t tests. Finally, to explore whether the (compression‐sleeve‐induced) changes in brachial artery FMD% related to a priori levels of FMD%, we have performed a Pearson's correlation coefficient between the change in FMD% versus baseline FMD% in both young and older men.

### Recovery interventions and strategies for improved tennis performance [^111csA2r]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Improving the recovery capabilities of the tennis athlete is receiving more emphasis in the research communities, and also by practitioners (coaches, physical trainers, tennis performance specialists, physical therapists, etc). The purpose of this article was to review areas of recovery to limit the severity of fatigue and/or speed recovery from fatigue. This review will cover four broad recovery techniques commonly used in tennis with the belief that the interventions may improve athlete recovery and therefore improve adaptation and future performance. The four areas covered are: (1) temperature-based interventions, (2) compressive clothing, (3) electronic interventions and (4) nutritional interventions.

### Influence of compression therapy on symptoms following soft tissue injury from maximal eccentric exercise [^112mJet2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A between groups design was used to compare recovery following eccentric muscle damage under 2 experimental conditions.

Objective

To determine if a compression sleeve donned immediately after maximal eccentric exercise would enhance recovery of physical function and decrease symptoms of soreness.

Background

Prior investigations using ice, intermittent compression, or exercise have not shown efficacy in relieving symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). To date, no study has shown the effect of continuous compression on DOMS, yet this would offer a low cost intervention for patients suffering with the symptoms of DOMS.

Methods and Measures

Twenty nonimpaired non-strength-trained women participated in the study. Subjects were matched for age, anthropometric data, and one repetition maximum concentric arm curl strength and then randomly placed into a control group (n = 10) or an experimental compression sleeve group (n = 10). Subjects were instructed to avoid pain-relieving modalities (eg, analgesic medications, ice) throughout the study. The experimental group wore a compressive sleeve garment for 5 days following eccentric exercise. Subjects performed 2 sets of 50 passive arm curls with the dominant arm on an isokinetic dynamometer with a maximal eccentric muscle action superimposed every fourth passive repetition. One repetition maximum elbow flexion, upper arm circumference, relaxed elbow angle, blood serum cortisol, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and perception of soreness questionnaires were collected prior to the exercise bout and daily thereafter for 5 days.

Results

Creatine kinase was significantly elevated from the baseline value in both groups, although the experimental compression test group showed decreased magnitude of creatine kinase elevation following the eccentric exercise. Compression sleeve use prevented loss of elbow motion, decreased perceived soreness, reduced swelling, and promoted recovery of force production.

Conclusions

Results from this study underline the importance of compression in soft tissue injury management.

### Adaptation of the by-band randomized clinical trial to by-band-sleeve to include a new intervention and maintain relevance of the study to practice [^114Yyk8B]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

One challenge to overcome when a study changes from two to three groups is to ensure that trial processes are not disrupted during the transition and that patients continue to be recruited and followed up in accordance with the protocol. For example, some patients were consented to a two‐group trial but, by the time they were randomized, the trial had switched to three groups. It was not feasible to have a further consultation to discuss the trial again, so the randomization for these patients was handled centrally by the trials unit to avoid them being allocated to the new procedure.

Another decision that needs to be made is whether the allocation ratio should be chosen to create approximately equally sized groups at the end of the trial, or whether the ratio should be 1: 1: 1 going forward, accepting that the sample size for the two original study groups will be larger than that for the new group. In the By‐Band‐Sleeve adaptation, the allocation ratio at each centre was adjusted to achieve approximately equal allocation overall. Although the revised allocation ratio should provide comparable power for all group comparisons, it is not without 'risks'. A balanced allocation may not be achieved if the trial stops early for any reason, or if the recruitment rates differ significantly from those predicted.

### Hemodynamic effect and safety of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression leg sleeves in patients with congestive heart failure [^111d46Mc]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumatic leg sleeves are widely used after prolonged operations for prevention of venous stasis. In healthy volunteers they increase cardiac function. We evaluated the hemodynamic effects and safety of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression (ISPC) leg sleeves in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).

Methods and Results

We studied 19 patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction and CHF. ISPC leg sleeves, each with 10 air cells, were operated by a computerized compressor, exerting 2 cycles/min. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters were measured before, during, and after ISPC activation. The baseline mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29 ± 9.2%, median 32%, range 10%-40%. Cardiac output (from 4.26 to 4.83 L/min; p = 0.008) and stroke volume (from 56.1 to 63.5 mL; p = 0.029) increased significantly after ISPC activation, without a reciprocal increase in heart rate, and declined after sleeve deactivation. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased significantly (from 1,520 to 1,216 dyne-s/cm5; p = 0.0005), and remained lower than the baseline level throughout the study. There was no detrimental effect on diastolic function and no adverse clinical events, despite increased pulmonary venous return.

Conclusions

ISPC leg sleeves in patients with chronic CHF do not exacerbate symptoms and transiently improve cardiac output through an increase in stroke volume and a reduction in SVR.

### Recovery interventions and strategies for improved tennis performance [^117GYAyR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Compressive clothing

In recent years, compressive clothing have become fashionable with athletes in the hopes of reducing injuries, benefiting performance and enhancing recovery. – Cycling performance has been shown to improve after wearing compressive clothing during recovery; however, effects on oxygen cost and RPE were unclear. The recovery benefits reported from the use of compressive clothing are similar to those reported for hydrotherapy, as hydrostatic pressures perform a similar role in both methods. These benefits stem from the graduated pressures which extend medially from limb extremities towards the body core. Studies indicate that the sports compression garments reduce postexercise oedema following eccentric work and reduce sensations of ensuing muscle soreness, as well as aid recovery of soft tissue injuries. Furthermore, reduced perception of fatigueand enhanced clearance of blood lactate and creatine kinase have been reported with compression garments compared with passive recovery. Although perceptions of fatigue is an important variable for athletes, limitations do exist using this measure in studies due to difficulty of blinding participants to whether they have received treatment (compressive clothing) versus passive recovery.

Although compressive clothing seems to have some favourable effects on recovery and subsequent performance, limited practical recommendations can be made at this time due to a number of factors, and limited research is currently available specifically in tennis. Also, more work is needed in comparing how compression of different limbs (ie, lower limbs vs upper limbs) may influence a tennis athlete's recovery. However, a combination of hydrotherapy techniques followed by the use of compressive garments appear to be beneficial for players between matches and post-training/event, whereas either strategy on its own is less effective. This notion was supported in a recent tennis-specific study that showed improved overall recovery in a number of factors if a combination of cold therapies, compression clothing and improved sleep hygiene was implemented. The study found improvements in time in play (approximately 10% increase in playing time), a large effect size (d > 0.90) compared with control in lower body power (as measured via a counter-movement Jump), and reduced perceived soreness.

### Upper body compression garment: physiological effects while cycling in a hot environment [^115YScoV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of an upper body compression garment (UBCG) on physiologic and perceptual responses while cycling in a hot environment.

Methods

Twenty recreational road cyclists were pair-matched for age, anthropometric data, and fitness level (V̇O 2max) and randomly assigned to a control (CON) group (n = 10) of cyclists who wore a conventional t-shirt or to a group (n = 10) of cyclists who wore UBCG. Test session consisted of cycling at a fixed load (~50% V̇O 2max) for 30 minutes at an ambient temperature of ~40ºC (39.9 ± 0.4ºC), followed by 10 minutes of recovery.

Results

Significantly greater (P = 0.002) rectal temperature (T rec) was observed at the end of exercise in the UBCG group (38.3 ± 0.2ºC) versus CON group (37.9 ± 0.3ºC). Significantly greater heart rate (HR) was observed in the UBCG group at minute 15 (P = 0.01) and at the end of exercise (187 ± 9 vs 173 ± 10 beats/min; p = 0.004) for UBCG and CON, respectively. Furthermore, participants who wore UBCG perceived a significantly greater (P = 0.03) thermal sensation at the end of exercise. During recovery HR and T rec remained significantly greater (P < .05) in the UBCG group.

Conclusions

The use of an UBCG increased cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain during cycling in a hot environment and did not aid during recovery.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^115vLQmd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Impact of Retrograde Shear: Older Men

Retrograde shear intervention

Brachial artery retrograde SR in the intervention arm increased significantly as a result of the compression sleeve intervention (P = 0.001). Post‐hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger retrograde shear after 30 minutes and after 2 weeks of wearing the compression sleeve (P < 0.05, Table 3). The change in antegrade SR, induced by the compression sleeve, did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08, Table 3).

Table 3

Brachial artery FMD% and diameter

Despite these effects of the compression sleeve on brachial artery shear patterns, we found no change in brachial artery diameter or FMD% after 30 minutes or after 2 weeks in the intervention arm (P = 0.14, Figure). We also observed no change in brachial artery antegrade or retrograde SR, diameter, or FMD% in the contralateral arm (P = 0.23, 0.09, 0.27, and 0.15, respectively, Table 3). In older participants, the individual change in FMD% after 2 weeks wearing the compression sleeve was not related to a priori FMD% (r = −0.34, P = 0.26).

### Effects of isometric handgrip training in patients with peripheral artery disease: a randomized controlled trial [^112oSxhh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions

After screening, a familiarization of the session with the program to be performed at home was conducted to ensure understanding and comfort with the program. During this session, patients' questions and any difficulties with performance of the program were addressed.

The IHT group performed 3 sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at home, guided by an experienced kinesiologist, who previously familiarized the patients with the exercise protocol and encouraged the patients by telephone to continue IHT training. The exercise protocol consisted of 4 sets of 2‐minute isometric handgrip holds unilateral (dominant arm), performed at 30% of maximum vonluntary contraction with a 4‐minute rest interval between repetitions. All patients used the Zona Plus (Zona Health, Inc, a Boise, ID) isometric handgrip device, which provided instructive text prompts, on a liquid crystal display, for each step of the training session, as well as visual (liquid crystal display pressure gauge) and audible signals for feedback to ensure compliance with the exercise intensity of the protocol. Adherence to the program was defined as completion of at least 80% of the prescribed training session, with > 96 seconds of isometric contraction held for each repetition in each session, exported from Zona Plus at the end of the training. Patients randomized to the CG received a compression ball in order to minimize the manipulation effect of a device and the placebo effects, thus representing sham training. It was recommended that the patients perform 3 sessions per week, with 3 sets of 10 compressions, for each hand, with a 1‐minute rest interval between sets.

Patients in both groups were instructed to increase their general daily physical activity level to meet the recommendations for PAD patients, namely, 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activities, or an equivalent combination of moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activities per week. Patients also received a diary to record the sessions and report difficulties during training. A visit was scheduled at the fifth week to provide feedback and discuss possible problems during the training. In addition, once every 2 weeks, each patient was contacted by phone to reinforce exercise recommendations.

### A call for continued global collaboration and research for the prevention of breast cancer related arm lymphoedema [^11417qJf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We agree with Hayes and colleagues that patient education on BCRAL is critical in clinical practice. However, a recent RCT showed that a comprehensive knowledge transfer program did not reduce the incidence of BCRAL at 18 weeks after surgery. Although it is possible that a significant difference could be observed with a longer follow-up, there is a suggestion that additional interventions may be required to enhance the effectiveness of education programs in preventing BCRAL in the early postoperative period. Our group is currently leading a systematic review to identify the emerging self-management and home-based interventions (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023478784) that can potentially be helpful for patients. We also plan to update this guidance regularly to reflect the latest evidence.

The RCT of Paramanandam et al. is the first study to date that evaluated the role of prophylactic compression sleeves in the prevention of BCRAL. Like all interventions, continual evaluation is crucial to establish whether prophylactic sleeves can be recommended as a standard of care for all patients. Hayes and colleagues have raised important directions that future investigators should explore. We support efforts to conduct additional clinical trials to study the psychological impact of prophylactic compressive sleeves, and whether modification of the sleeves can further enhance the efficacy with less discomfort to patients. Nevertheless, as some patients may develop BCRAL as early as six months after surgeryand will find prophylactic compression sleeves helpful. Patients should be provided with self-management education, and be instructed to return to their healthcare team if there are any problems or concerns with their sleeves.

### Impact of 2-weeks continuous increase in retrograde shear stress on brachial artery vasomotor function in young and older men [^117VSbpk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

A potential limitation is that we were unable to determine the pressure generated by the compression sleeve on the vasculature. Retrospective testing performed in all participants suggest that the compression sleeve induced a compression equivalent to 16 to 28 mm Hg. Differences in circumference of the forearm between individuals likely lead to some variation in the pressure applied to the vessel, thereby manipulating the level of retrograde SR between individuals. Nonetheless, our experiment was effective in its utilization of a compression sleeve to manipulate retrograde shear. Another limitation is that adherence to the intervention was self‐reported. While we measured the impact of the sleeve on retrograde shear both acutely and after 2 weeks, and this effect was persistent and sustained, we did not assess effects during activities of daily living. It is also pertinent that all subjects reported to our laboratory after 3 to 4 days to replace the compression sleeve, which automatically served as a moment to check adherence to the intervention. This study does not provide any biomolecular insight into the mechanisms behind the responses to retrograde shear. However, it is important to emphasize that this was not the purpose of our study, especially since this is the first study to introduce and evaluate an in vivo procedure to chronically manipulate retrograde shear. Finally, we did not perform assessment of endothelium‐independent dilation. Nonetheless, our primary finding of change in arterial function after prolonged retrograde SR in young, but not in older men, remains robust.

Perspectives

Our compression‐sleeve intervention successfully increased retrograde shear both acutely (30 minutes) and chronically (2 weeks) in both the younger and the older group. In young men, the increased retrograde shear produced by the compression sleeve impaired brachial artery endothelial function at 30 minutes, and chronic manipulation of retrograde shear was associated with a decrease in endothelial function comparable to that observed after 30 minutes. These findings highlight the potential detrimental impact of chronic elevations in retrograde SR. In marked contrast, older men demonstrate no change in endothelial function in response to this method of producing acute or chronic exposure to retrograde SR. This suggests advanced age is associated with impaired or attenuated ability of the vasculature to adapt in response to increases in retrograde SR in men in vivo, possibly due to blunted endothelial function as reflected in lower FMD.

### Immediate effects of active exercise with compression therapy on lower-limb lymphedema [^1124w32o]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lymphedema is a progressive chronic condition characterized by accumulation of fluid in the tissue spaces resulting from lymphatic system insufficiency and deranged lymph transport. A prevalence of 20–27.2% has been reported for secondary lower-limb lymphedema (LLL) in patients who have undergone radical interventions, including pelvic lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, for gynecological cancer. LLL has negative impacts on house work, physical activity, mobility, social activities, and psychological well-being. If patients with LLL are not properly managed, the LLL will become progressively worse, causing disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and declines in quality of life. Prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment are thus crucial in the management of lymphedema.

Complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) is widely carried out in the clinical setting as a standard treatment and generally involves a two-stage treatment program that comprises intensive and supportive phases. The first, intensive phase consists of skin care, manual lymph drainage (MLD), multi-layered compression bandaging, and exercise with compression. The second, supportive phase consists of skin care, self-MLD, compression by an elastic garment, and continued exercise with compression to conserve the results obtained in the first phase.

Several studies have examined the effects of active exercise with compression therapy (AECT) on upper-limb lymphedema (ULL). Gautam et al. showed the effects of an 8-week home exercise program comprising resistance training and stretching on decrements in limb volume. Kim et al. also reported volume decrements with an 8-week intervention that added resistance training to CDP. Furthermore, Jeffs et al. revealed the effects of 26-week home-based resistance training on volume decrements. Concerning immediate results, the effects of AECT comprising four 12-min sessions of exercise on lymphedema related to breast cancer and of gentle arm exercise on ULL have been reported. Consequently, long- and short-term AECTs are beneficial to ULL in terms of volume decrement.

On the other hand, while Katz et al. showed the feasibility of resistance training, no reports have described the long- and short-term effects of AECT on LLL. We therefore focused on the immediate effects of AECT and tried to clarify appropriate modalities such as exercise intensity, timing, and type.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of AECT performed using a bicycle ergometer on LLL.

### Review of the evidence of lymphedema treatment effect [^115w5mEf]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphedema treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, and reduce risk for skin infection. Mainstream treatment options have been investigated in more than 160 studies. Findings from these studies have been included in at least 1 of more than 20 literature reviews. A critique of these reviews was undertaken to summarize efficacy findings. The quality of the reviews was evaluated, and gaps in the research were identified to better guide clinical practice. Overall, there was wide variation in review methods. The quality of studies included in reviews, in study design and reporting overall, has been poor. Reviews consistently concluded that complex physical therapy is effective at reducing limb volume. Volume reductions were also reported after the use of compression garments, pumps, and manual lymphatic drainage. However, greatest improvements were reported when these treatments formed a combined treatment program. Large, well-designed, evaluated, and reported randomised, controlled trials are needed to evaluate and compare treatments. Consistent outcome measures will allow better quality reviews and meta-analysis in the future.

### Comparison of three types of full-body compression garments on throwing and repeat-sprint performance in cricket players [^116ArqzK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of three types of full-body compression garments (Skins, Adidas and Under Armour) on repeat-sprint and throwing performance in cricket players.

Methods

Following familiarisation, 10 male cricket players performed four randomised exercise sessions (3 garments and a control). Each session involved a 30 min repeat-sprint exercise protocol comprising 20 m sprints every minute, separated by submaximal exercise. Throwing tests included a pre-exercise and a postexercise maximal distance test and accuracy throwing tests. During each session, measures of heart rate, skin temperature, change in body mass, rate of perceived exertion and perceived muscle soreness were recorded. Capillary blood samples were analysed before and after exercise for lactate, pH, O(2) saturation and O(2) partial pressure, and 24 h after exercise for creatine kinase (CK). Ratings of perceived muscle soreness were also obtained 24 h after exercise.

Results

No significant differences (p > 0.05) were evident in repeat-sprint performance (10 m, 20 m time or total submaximal distance covered) or throwing performance (maximum distance or accuracy). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in heart rate, body mass change or blood measures during exercise. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed by way of higher mean skin temperature, lower 24 h postexercise CK values and lower 24 h postexercise ratings of muscle soreness when wearing compression garments. Analysis between respective brands of compression garments revealed no statistical differences (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

No benefit was noted when wearing compression garments for repeat-sprint or throwing performance; however, the use of the garments as a recovery tool, when worn after exercise, may be beneficial to reduce postexercise trauma and perceived muscle soreness.

### Interest of an auto-adjustable nighttime compression sleeve (MOBIDERM® autofit) in maintenance phase of upper limb lymphedema: the MARILYN pilot RCT [^114nQSNp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Compression is largely described as the key component in the treatment of lymphedema in the updated best practice guidelines of International Lymphedema Framework (ILF). In France, the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) recommends to use high-pressure compression garments (up to 15 mmHg with the need to apply the higher pressure tolerated by patient) during the day and if needed, low stretched bandages during the night without any pressure specifications. More recently, Damstra and Partsch showed that applying too much pressure under low-stretch bandages may be counterproductive and recommends levels of 20–30 mmHg for the upper limb. Self-management and patient compliance to treatment are crucial in the maintenance phase. Among the 306 patients observed in POLIT study, maintenance therapy was applied in most patients by means of daytime hosiery (95.8%) and/or bandages (12.3%) meaning some patients used both day devices. At night, 21.1% of the patients did not use any night compression therapy. Among the rest, 45.2% of the patients reported night compression therapy using bandaging and 46% with made to measure hosieries.

In practice, during maintenance phase, the bandages are not easy to put on and require assistance and/or specific patient's education. Composed of several layers of inelastic and short-stretch materials, these bulky bandages do not favor patient's compliance and quality of life. Custom made short-stretch arm sleeve, designed to apply a low rest pressure, are easier to put on but can be quickly unsuitable if patient's measurements vary over time. The challenge is to provide BCRL patients with an easy to use, safe and effective low-stretch night device as an add-on treatment to their daytime compression hosiery in order to optimize their maintenance treatment and increase their autonomy and compliance.

This study was conducted to assess the interest of nighttime MOBIDERM® Autofit arm sleeve on lymphedema volume during maintenance phase in patients with BCRL.

### Development and psychometric validation of a patient-reported outcome measure for arm lymphedema: the LYMPH-Q upper extremity module [^116hCoaM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Test-retest data were provided by 79 of the participants. Five of the participants reported a change in their health or life since completing the scales and were excluded. Appendix 2 shows the ICC values with 95% confidence intervals. The ICC values for the six scales was 0.92 or higher. The scale-level missing data value was low (≤ 1.4%, see Appendix 2). Floor effects were low (≤ 4.3%), and ceiling effects ranged from 4.1% (symptoms) to 22.7% (psychological) (Appendix 2). The mean grade reading levels for the items in each scale were between 2.5 (symptoms, sleeve) and 15.6 (psychological), and the grade reading levels for the instructions ranged from 3.7 (psychological) to 14.1 (information).

Table 2 shows the Pearson correlations between the LYMPH-Q Upper Extremity Module scales. As hypothesized, the correlations between the scores on the four outcome scales were stronger with each other than with the two satisfaction scales. The correlations between the four outcome scales all met the level of > 0.50 for related measures. The only correlations not in accordance with our hypothesized values, as per the COSMIN guidelines for construct validity, were the correlations between the arm sleeves scale and the symptoms, function, and psychological scales, which were higher than predicted.

Pearson correlations between the LYMPH-Q upper extremity module scales

a p ≤ 0.001; criteria: similar constructs, ≥ 0.50; related but dissimilar constructs, 0.30–0.50; unrelated constructs, < 0.30

Consistent with our hypotheses, increased severity of arm swelling (Fig. 1), reporting of an arm problem caused by cancer or cancer treatments (Fig. 2), and wearing of a compression sleeve to reduce or prevent swelling in the past 12 months (Fig. 3) all were meaningfully associated with worse outcomes in all six LYMPH-Q Upper Extremity Module scales. Differences between scale scores by subgroups were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all the scales in these three hypotheses. The characteristics of the subgroups for these tests of construct validity can be found in Appendix 4a–c.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^111msRiR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

MASCC breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) prevention — risk factors and preventive strategies — identifies axillary lymph node dissection, use of post-operative radiotherapy, relative within-arm volume increase one month after surgery, greater number of lymph nodes dissected, and high body mass index as the most important risk factors to guide selection of patients for interventions to prevent BCRAL, and states that prospective surveillance programs should be implemented to screen for and reduce risks of BCRAL where feasible and resources allow; additionally, prophylactic compression sleeves, axillary reverse mapping and prophylactic lymphatic reconstruction should be offered for patients who are at risk for developing BCRAL as options where expertise is available and resources allow.
