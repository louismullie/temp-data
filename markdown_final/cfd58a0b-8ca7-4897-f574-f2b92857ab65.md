## Question

Failure to thrive

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about failure to thrive (FTT), specifically seeking a synthesis that covers definition, epidemiology, etiologies, evaluation, management, outcomes, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define FTT using modern, z-score–based criteria and distinguish it from normal growth variants. Then, I should verify prevalence and why definitions matter. Next, I will categorize etiologies and quantify their relative contributions. After that, I need to outline a stepwise evaluation emphasizing history, exam, and targeted testing. Then, I will detail management principles, including catch-up nutrition and when to use multidisciplinary care. Finally, I should review long-term outcomes, special populations, and controversies, and close with a concise, practical algorithm that aligns with current evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on outdated percentile rules. Modern guidance prefers "growth faltering" and defines it using WHO/CDC z-scores: a fall in weight-for-age z-score of at least 1.0 merits evaluation, with attention to the trajectory and context, and traditional cutoffs like weight below the 5th percentile or crossing two major percentile lines have low positive predictive value and should be interpreted cautiously [^d20cbaf0] [^d4b5709b] [^80951838]. Hold on, I should verify that this shift also affects diagnosis rates; indeed, switching from CDC to WHO growth curves changed FTT incidence differently in younger versus older infants, underscoring how definitional choices influence case finding [^d8f74c24].

> Next, I should review prevalence and why it varies. Estimates in primary care range from about 5–10% in U.S. children, but the proportion identified depends on the anthropometric criteria used; different criteria yield poor concordance, with positive predictive values ranging from 1% to 58%, which explains why some children are over- or under-identified as having FTT [^80951838] [^3389d6f5]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this variability argues for standardized z-score–based screening and longitudinal assessment rather than reliance on a single cutoff or percentile crossing [^d20cbaf0].

> I will now examine etiologies, and I need to ensure I don't over-attribute to organic disease. In most series, inadequate caloric intake is the most common cause, accounting for roughly 60–90% of cases, whereas organic disease accounts for about 10–20%, and the remainder are mixed or unknown; this distribution holds across outpatient and referral settings, though the proportion of organic disease rises in subspecialty clinics [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c] [^82279eed]. Hold on, I should verify that hospitalized cohorts show a similar pattern; yes, even in hospitalized children, most cases reflect insufficient intake rather than organic disease, reinforcing the need to prioritize feeding history and behavioral interventions before extensive testing [^7f2e3544].

> Let me consider the major etiologic buckets so I don't miss key differentials. Nonorganic causes include psychosocial stressors, food insecurity, caregiver mental health issues, and feeding difficulties; organic causes include gastrointestinal disorders (celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, inflammatory bowel disease, protein-losing enteropathy), endocrine and metabolic diseases (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, inborn errors of metabolism), respiratory disease (chILD, NEHI, cystic fibrosis), cardiovascular disease (congenital heart disease, hypertension), neurologic and neuromuscular conditions affecting feeding, and genetic syndromes (22q11.2 deletion, Turner syndrome, lysosomal storage diseases) [^d20cbaf0] [^c7557ab6] [^67796793] [^66eff670] [^5306dd80] [^d0402fcc]. I should double-check that some of these present subtly; indeed, diencephalic syndrome and infantile renovascular hypertension can present with FTT as the initial manifestation, so a high index of suspicion is warranted when growth falters despite adequate intake [^fcbcf11c] [^acde7fb0].

> Now, I need to outline the evaluation, and I should confirm that history and exam drive testing. A careful feeding history (what, how much, how often, who feeds, stressors), a three-day dietary diary, and a focused exam for dysmorphisms, cardiac murmurs, organomegaly, and neurologic signs are essential; routine labs rarely reveal a cause and should be reserved for severe malnutrition, red flags, or failure of initial therapy [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c]. Wait, let me verify the yield of invasive testing; endoscopy and imaging have low diagnostic yield in the absence of targeted indications, so they should be used sparingly and based on clinical clues [^eadeac4c].

> I should confirm which targeted tests are reasonable when red flags are present. A basic screen can include CBC, CMP, TSH, and urinalysis; add celiac serology if diarrhea or malabsorption, sweat test if respiratory symptoms or malabsorption, and consider genetic testing if dysmorphisms, developmental delay, or family history suggest a syndrome; in infants with severe metabolic acidosis or hyperammonemia, evaluate for inborn errors of metabolism [^d20cbaf0] [^05490231] [^0c3c5700] [^5306dd80]. Hold on, I should verify that some diagnoses are frequently missed initially; indeed, genetic disorders are often not identified during hospitalization, so persistent FTT warrants reconsideration of genetic etiologies and longitudinal follow-up [^17d9326e].

> Next, I should review management principles, and I need to ensure I emphasize catch-up growth. All children with FTT require additional calories for catch-up, typically about 150% of the estimated requirement for their expected (not actual) weight, delivered via structured feeding, avoidance of grazing, and nutritional counseling; energy-dense formulas can help when intake is limited [^d20cbaf0] [^0efc9b4c]. Let me verify that multidisciplinary care improves outcomes; yes, adherence to behavioral and nutritional interventions is associated with improved z-score changes, and home visiting or coordinated care can enhance growth and parent–child interactions, especially in high-risk families [^eadeac4c] [^a6d08708].

> I should confirm when hospitalization is indicated. Indications include severe malnutrition, failure of outpatient management, suspicion of abuse or neglect, or significant psychosocial impairment; in-hospital observation of weight gain can be informative but is nonspecific for distinguishing neglect from other etiologies, so it should not be used in isolation to assign blame [^d20cbaf0] [^e8d974d2]. But wait, what if refeeding syndrome is a concern? In otherwise healthy young children with FTT, routine electrolyte monitoring for refeeding syndrome rarely reveals abnormalities, suggesting that low-risk protocols can safely reduce unnecessary labs while maintaining vigilance in high-risk contexts [^a06d0368].

> Now, I will examine long-term outcomes, and I should be cautious not to overstate causality. Systematic review data suggest a modest IQ decrement of about 3–4 points and persistent small deficits in height and weight, though many children recover anthropometrically by school age; early intervention may mitigate some behavioral and academic risks, but confounding by socioeconomic context is substantial [^069094bf] [^3527b61e] [^a6d08708]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the evidence base is heterogeneous and often observational, so individualized counseling and close developmental surveillance are prudent, especially in the first two years when neurodevelopment is most vulnerable [^d20cbaf0].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. Late preterm and early term infants are at higher risk of feeding difficulties and FTT and warrant early, frequent follow-up; children with congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, or chronic lung disease have increased caloric needs and may require specialized nutrition; and rare entities like diencephalic syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion can present with isolated FTT, so persistent cases deserve targeted evaluation and, when indicated, genetic testing [^fac24e48] [^8b0b58ec] [^67796793] [^fcbcf11c] [^bb97e078] [^5306dd80]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought severe FTT independently worsened cardiac surgery outcomes; let me reconsider — one large series found severe FTT was common but not independently associated with mortality, whereas preoperative sepsis and ICU needs were stronger predictors, so I should avoid over-attributing surgical risk to FTT alone [^33b5ed83].

> I should double-check disparities and systems issues because they shape both risk and care. Non-elective admissions for FTT are more frequent among Black and Hispanic children and those from lower-income neighborhoods, and are associated with longer lengths of stay yet lower odds of feeding tube placement, suggesting structural barriers and implicit bias in access and decision-making; screening for food insecurity and psychosocial stressors is essential to avoid both under- and over-diagnosis [^b1b87f00] [^94220caf]. Hold on, I should verify that these findings align with broader child health equity frameworks; yes, recent calls emphasize child-inclusive policies and addressing commercial and social determinants to reduce preventable growth faltering [^8e101d2f].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Screen all infants with standardized growth charts and calculate z-scores; confirm FTT with repeat measurements and a detailed feeding history; initiate catch-up nutrition and structured feeding; reassess in 2–4 weeks; if no improvement, add targeted labs and consider referral to pediatric gastroenterology, nutrition, or genetics based on red flags; hospitalize for severe malnutrition, safety concerns, or failed outpatient therapy; and arrange close follow-up until catch-up growth is established and stable, with developmental surveillance thereafter [^d20cbaf0] [^d4b5709b] [^eadeac4c]. I should confirm that this approach balances overtesting with under-recognition; yes, current guidance supports restraint with routine labs and escalation only when indicated, which reduces harm while preserving diagnostic yield where it matters most [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c].

---

Failure to thrive (FTT) is best defined as **persistent undernutrition** with weight-for-age z-score ≤ −2.0 or a downward shift across ≥ 2 weight centiles, confirmed on repeat measurements over time [^d20cbaf0] [^d4b5709b]. The most common cause is **inadequate caloric intake** due to feeding difficulties, psychosocial stressors, or neglect; organic causes (malabsorption, chronic disease, genetic/metabolic disorders) account for a minority but must be considered when red flags are present [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c]. Evaluation should be **guided by history and exam**, with targeted labs reserved for severe cases or when initial management fails; routine screening is low yield [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c]. Management centers on **nutritional rehabilitation** with 120–150% of usual caloric intake, structured feeding, and close follow-up; multidisciplinary care is indicated for complex or refractory cases [^d20cbaf0] [^7d20f966]. Early intervention improves growth and may mitigate long-term cognitive and behavioral risks, though some deficits can persist [^a6d08708] [^3527b61e].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

FTT is a **clinical syndrome** characterized by inadequate growth, most often defined by anthropometric criteria:

- **Weight-for-age z-score ≤ −2.0**: Indicates severe undernutrition and is the most sensitive single indicator [^d20cbaf0].
- **Downward shift across ≥ 2 weight centiles**: Reflects a significant decline in growth velocity [^d4b5709b].
- **Confirmation over time**: Diagnosis should be confirmed with repeat measurements to exclude transient fluctuations [^d20cbaf0].

---

## Etiology

FTT is **multifactorial**; causes are broadly categorized as nonorganic (psychosocial/environmental) or organic (medical):

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Nonorganic | - Inadequate intake due to feeding difficulties <br/> - Parental stress or mental health issues <br/> - Neglect or food insecurity <br/> - Lack of feeding knowledge or support [^d20cbaf0] [^94220caf] |
| Organic | - Gastrointestinal disorders (celiac, IBD, GERD, eosinophilic esophagitis) <br/> - Chronic diseases (CHD, CKD, CF, asthma) <br/> - Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency) <br/> - Genetic/metabolic disorders (22q11.2 deletion, mitochondrial disease) <br/> - Infectious diseases (HIV, TB) [^d20cbaf0] [^c7557ab6] [^5306dd80] [^4196d8de] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Detailed feeding history, growth trajectory, psychosocial factors, family history, and review of systems [^d20cbaf0].
- **Physical examination**: Growth parameters, signs of malnutrition, dysmorphic features, organomegaly, and systemic disease clues [^d20cbaf0].
- **Laboratory testing**: Reserved for severe cases, red flags, or when initial management fails; includes CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, urinalysis, and targeted tests based on clinical suspicion [^d20cbaf0] [^eadeac4c].

---

## Management

Management focuses on **nutritional rehabilitation** and addressing underlying causes:

- **Nutritional rehabilitation**: Provide 120–150% of usual caloric intake for catch-up growth; structured feeding schedules and nutritional counseling are key [^d20cbaf0] [^6b88fc1a].
- **Addressing underlying causes**: Treat medical conditions, provide feeding therapy, and address psychosocial contributors [^d20cbaf0].
- **Follow-up**: Close monitoring until consistent catch-up growth is achieved, then gradual transition to normal intake [^d20cbaf0].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Early identification and intervention improve growth and developmental outcomes, but **long-term risks** may persist:

- **Growth**: Many children recover, but some remain shorter and lighter than peers [^3527b61e].
- **Cognitive and behavioral effects**: Modest IQ deficits and behavioral problems are reported, with early intervention mitigating risks [^3527b61e] [^a6d08708].
- **Chronic disease risk**: Early undernutrition may increase susceptibility to chronic diseases later in life [^b0566baf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and toddlers**: Rapid growth demands make early FTT particularly consequential; close monitoring and early intervention are critical [^d20cbaf0].
- **Chronic illnesses**: Require multidisciplinary care and tailored nutrition plans [^d20cbaf0].
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Food insecurity and caregiver stress significantly contribute to FTT and must be addressed [^94220caf].

---

Failure to thrive is a **persistent undernutrition syndrome** with diverse causes; **early recognition**, targeted evaluation, and nutritional rehabilitation are the cornerstones of management, with outcomes improved by addressing both medical and psychosocial contributors.

### Failure to thrive [^7d20f966]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive is a condition commonly seen by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important for preventing malnutrition and developmental sequelae. Medical and social factors often contribute to failure to thrive. Either extreme of parental attention (neglect or hypervigilance) can lead to failure to thrive. About 25 percent of normal infants will shift to a lower growth percentile in the first two years of life and then follow that percentile; this should not be diagnosed as failure to thrive. Infants with Down syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, or premature birth follow different growth patterns than normal infants. Many infants with failure to thrive are not identified unless careful attention is paid to plotting growth parameters at routine checkups. A thorough history is the best guide to establishing the etiology of the failure to thrive and directing further evaluation and management. All children with failure to thrive need additional calories for catch-up growth (typically 150 percent of the caloric requirement for their expected, not actual, weight). Few need laboratory evaluation. Hospitalization is rarely required and is indicated only for severe failure to thrive and for those whose safety is a concern. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended when failure to thrive persists despite intervention or when it is severe.

### Growth faltering and failure to thrive in children [^d20cbaf0]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth faltering, previously known as failure to thrive, is a broad term describing children who do not reach their expected weight, length, or body mass index for age. Growth is assessed with standardized World Health Organization charts for children younger than two years and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charts for children two years and older. Traditional criteria for growth faltering can be imprecise and difficult to track over time; therefore, use of anthropometric z scores are now recommended. These scores can be calculated with a single set of measurements to assess malnutrition severity. Inadequate caloric intake, the most common cause of growth faltering, is identified with a detailed feeding history and physical examination. Diagnostic testing is reserved for those who have severe malnutrition or symptoms concerning for high-risk conditions, or if initial treatment fails. In older children or those with comorbidities, it is important to screen for underlying eating disorders (e.g., avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia). Growth faltering can usually be managed by the primary care physician. If comorbid disease is identified, a multidisciplinary team (e.g., nutritionist, psychologist, pediatric subspecialists) may be beneficial. Failure to recognize and treat growth faltering in the first two years of life may result in decreased adult height and cognitive potential.

### Severe failure to thrive in infant [^e1c2a65c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in an infant has multiple etiologies and at times, is only manifestation of underlying serious disease. Bartter syndrome is a rare disease that manifests as failure to thrive. It can be diagnosed by a careful history, physical examination, and abnormal electrolyte pattern. It can be alleviated by appropriate management, whereas failure to recognize early can be life threatening. A case of severe failure to thrive in an infant due to neonatal form of Bartter syndrome, its manifestations, management, and outcome is presented in this article.

### Failure to thrive as a manifestation of child neglect [^36eced8a]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive is a common problem in infancy and childhood. It is most often multifactorial in origin. Inadequate nutrition and disturbed social interactions contribute to poor weight gain, delayed development, and abnormal behavior. The syndrome develops in a significant number of children as a consequence of child neglect. This clinical report is intended to focus the pediatrician on the consideration, evaluation, and management of failure to thrive when child neglect may be present. Child protective services agencies should be notified when the evaluation leads to a suspicion of abuse or neglect.

### What is the long term outcome for children who fail to thrive? A systematic review [^069094bf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To ascertain the long term outcomes in children diagnosed as having failure to thrive (FTT).

Methods

Systematic review of cohort studies. Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane, and DARE databases were searched for potentially relevant studies.

Inclusion Criteria

cohort studies or randomised controlled trials in children < 2 years old with failure to thrive defined as weight < 10th centile or lower centile and/or weight velocity < 10th centile, with growth, development, or behaviour measured at 3 years of age or older.

Results

Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria; eight included a comparison group, of which five included children identified in community settings. Two were randomised controlled trials. Attrition rates were 10–30%. Data from population based studies with comparison groups and which reported comparable outcomes in an appropriate form were pooled in a random effects meta-analysis. Four studies report IQ scores at follow up and the pooled standardised mean difference was -0.22 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.03). Two studies reported growth data as standard deviation scores. Their pooled weighted mean difference for weight was -1.24 SDS (95% CI -2.00 to -0.48), and for height -0.87 SDS (95% CI -1.47 to -0.28). No studies corrected for parental height, but two reported that parents of index children were shorter.

Conclusions

The IQ difference (equivalent to approximately 3 IQ points) is of questionable clinical significance. The height and weight differences are larger, but few children were below the 3rd centile at follow up. It is unclear to what extent observed differences reflect causal relations or confounding due to other variables. In the light of these results the aggressive approach to identification and management of failure to thrive needs reassessing.

### Failure to thrive: a practical guide [^a36cef77]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Children with very low weight for age or height and those who do not maintain an appropriate growth pattern may have failure to thrive (FTT), also known as weight faltering. If confirmed by repeated valid measurements, FTT should prompt a search for causes of undernutrition, including neglect, family food insecurity, and underlying medical conditions. Inadequate caloric intake is the most common cause of FTT, but inadequate nutrient absorption or increased metabolism is also possible. Difficulty attaining or maintaining appropriate weight is the first indication of FTT, and sustained undernutrition can impede appropriate height, head circumference, and the development of cognitive skills or immune function in extreme cases. Early identification and management of the issues causing undernutrition are critical. In most cases, an appropriate growth velocity can be established with outpatient management based on proper nutrition and family support. Primary care physicians can effectively treat most children with FTT, and subspecialist consultation or hospitalization is rarely indicated.

### Failure to thrive: an update [^80951838]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in childhood is a state of undernutrition due to inadequate caloric intake, inadequate caloric absorption, or excessive caloric expenditure. In the United States, it is seen in 5 to 10 percent of children in primary care settings. Although failure to thrive is often defined as a weight for age that falls below the 5th percentile on multiple occasions or weight deceleration that crosses two major percentile lines on a growth chart, use of any single indicator has a low positive predictive value. Most cases of failure to thrive involve inadequate caloric intake caused by behavioral or psychosocial issues. The most important part of the outpatient evaluation is obtaining an accurate account of a child's eating habits and caloric intake. Routine laboratory testing rarely identifies a cause and is not generally recommended. Reasons to hospitalize a child for further evaluation include failure of outpatient management, suspicion of abuse or neglect, or severe psychosocial impairment of the caregiver. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including home nursing visits and nutritional counseling, has been shown to improve weight gain, parent-child relationships, and cognitive development. The long-term effects of failure to thrive on cognitive development and future academic performance are unclear.

### Failure to thrive: still a problem of definition [^e890b700]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The term 'failure to thrive' (FTT) is widely used to describe inadequate growth in early childhood. However, no consensus exists concerning the specific anthropometrical criteria to define this description. The aim of this study was to make an updated assessment concerning the use of FTT definitions and describe possible trends regarding the use of specific criteria. A cross-sectional review was done covering English-language articles published from January 2003 until June 2004, and recent textbooks of general pediatrics. Most of the reviewed literature broadly defined FTT as inadequate growth and total agreement existed to define FTT based solely on anthropometrical parameters. Large differences, however, were seen regarding which growth parameters to use and whether to use attained values or velocities. Weight was the most predominant choice, but many included more than one anthropometrical parameter. Failure to thrive in children is currently described solely based on anthropometrical indicators, with weight gain as the predominant choice of indicator and cut off around the 5th percentile. Discussion is needed as to whether the term 'failure to thrive' is still a useful common term for pediatric undernutrition of different types.

### Hospitalization for failure to thrive: a prospective descriptive report [^7f2e3544]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is a common symptom leading to hospitalization of children. Most literature describing this population is from 30 years ago. Since that time the hospitalized population has become more medically complex. We aimed to describe children hospitalized for FTT in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. We prospectively collected demographic, anthropometric, evaluation, and outcome data for 92 consecutive children admitted with FTT. The majority of children grew with behavioral interventions alone (primary nonorganic FTT) and had negative evaluation (n = 63). Children with primary organic FTT had longer hospital stays (7 vs 4 days; P < .001) and lower daily weight gain (35 vs 58 g/d; P < .001). Laboratory, radiological, and endoscopic evaluation rarely led to a diagnostic etiology of FTT in hospitalized children. We conclude that children hospitalized with FTT should be observed for weight gain prior to pursuing diagnostic investigation.

### Etiology of failure to thrive in infants and toddlers referred to a pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic [^82279eed]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the underlying etiology of failure to thrive (FTT) in infants and toddlers referred to an outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. A chart review was done on FTT referrals to a pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic between 2002 and 2005. Majority of patients (51.5%) had a purely nutritional deficiency. The endocrine etiologies included short stature due to being small for gestational age, constitutional or familial short stature (28.9%). The third most common etiology was gastrointestinal disease. Endocrine causes of FTT seem to be rare even in the selected population of patients referred to pediatric endocrine outpatient clinics. In the primary care setting, nutritional assessment and consultation seem to be adequate in the majority of cases. Only a small percentage of the patients with FTT will require a multidisciplinary approach and more extensive work-up.

### Failure to thrive: current clinical concepts… [^e29ee557]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Failure to thrive or growth failure has long been a major focus of attention and critical thought for pediatricians. Over many years, consensus has evolved about its cause, outcome, diagnosis, and management. By the last half of the 20th century, mainstream thinking held that FTT developed by one of two alternative mechanisms. On rare occasions, an underlying medical condition could lead to a failure of growth, which would present as "organic" FTT. In such cases, correct management of this underlying disorder would allow the patient to resume his or her normal growth. However, in most FTT cases, as many as 90% in some series, it was believed that no underlying medical diagnosis could be made. Affected children were said to have "nonorganic" FTT. This term and its synonym, "psychosocial" FTT, were often used as euphemisms to imply that the. Comments

### Characteristics of failure to thrive in a referral population: implications for treatment [^28f3c959]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive (FTT) in children is an important pediatric problem. Environmental and behavioral causes predominate, and detrimental effects on neurocognitive development are well documented. Multidisciplinary clinics designed to identify and treat FTT are effective but have not been widely adopted. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients with FTT seen at the authors' large inner-city children's hospital over a 40-month period, including those referred to a new multidisciplinary clinic. Over 40 months, only 75 children were referred and only 20 had moderate or severe FTT (z-score < -2.0). Nutritional status improved with treatment, but the small number of referrals who were severely affected led to the closing of the clinic. Recommendations for evaluating and treating children with mild FTT in primary care settings and a standardized definition of FTT that warrants more intensive treatment would help ensure that children were referred and treated appropriately.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^6b88fc1a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Faltering growth in infants and children < 2 years of age is a common problem regularly seen by health care professionals. It has multiple causes and occurs due to disease-related and non-disease related factors, and in low-, middle-, and high- income settings. However, in all settings it is essential to detect FG, address underlying causes and support catch-up growth where this is indicated.

### Failure to thrive: the prevalence and concurrence of anthropometric criteria in a general infant population [^3389d6f5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to thrive (FTT) in early childhood is associated with subsequent developmental delay and is recognised to reflect relative undernutrition. Although the concept of FTT is widely used, no consensus exists regarding a specific definition, and it is unclear to what extent different anthropometric definitions concur.

Objective

To compare the prevalence and concurrence of different anthropometric criteria for FTT and test the sensitivity and positive predictive values of these in detecting children with "significant undernutrition", defined as the combination of slow conditional weight gain and low body mass index (BMI).

Methods

Seven criteria of FTT, including low weight for age, low BMI, low conditional weight gain and Waterlow's criterion for wasting, were applied to a birth cohort of 6090 Danish infants. The criteria were compared in two age groups: 2–6 and 6–11 months of life.

Results

27% of infants met one or more criteria in at least one of the two age groups. The concurrence among the criteria was generally poor, with most children identified by only one criterion. Positive predictive values of different criteria ranged from 1% to 58%. Most single criteria identified either less than half the cases of significant undernutrition (found in 3%) or included far too many, thus having a low positive predictive value. Children with low weight for height tended to be relatively tall.

Conclusions

No single measurement on its own seems to be adequate for identifying nutritional growth delay. Further longitudinal population studies are needed to investigate the discriminating power of different criteria in detecting significant undernutrition and subsequent outcomes.

### Just another case of diarrhea and vomiting? [^4dce0acd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic intussusception is a treatable cause of failure to thrive. It is an uncommon condition often diagnosed late. The presenting features differ from acute intussusception. Chronic intussusception presents with a varying combination of abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss/failure to thrive, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. An abdominal mass may or may not be palpable. The classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood per rectum is uncommon. The purpose of this report is to present a small series of 3 cases and review 19 previously reported cases of chronic intussusception. Considering the diagnosis of chronic intussusception in children who present with failure to thrive and recurrent nonspecific abdominal symptoms is emphasized.

### Etiologies of poor weight gain and ultimate diagnosis in children admitted for growth faltering [^17d9326e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Growth faltering (GF) (previously failure to thrive) is a common reason for hospital admission, but there is little data on whether diagnoses made during initial admission remain accurate in follow-up. We sought to characterize infants admitted for isolated GF and identify diagnoses at discharge and ultimate diagnoses determined over 2 years of follow-up, to determine how diagnoses changed. We also sought to identify patient factors on admission associated with ultimate diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of children aged 2 weeks to 2 years with index admissions for GF from 2013 to 2017. We reviewed clinical data and documentation to determine discharge and ultimate diagnosis, and identify factors associated with ultimate diagnosis.

Results

Of 497 patients, 292 (59%) had insufficient intake, 103 (20%) had organic disease including 36 genetic disorders, 52 (11%) had mechanical feeding difficulties, and 50 (10%) had mixed or unknown diagnoses 2 years after admission. Over 90% of cases of insufficient intake were diagnosed during admission. Sixty-five percent of organic diseases, and only 39% of genetic disorders, were diagnosed during admission. Patient factors associated with genetic disorders included previous NICU stay, low birth weight, dysphagia, hypotonia, and dysmorphisms.

Conclusions

Insufficient intake remains the most common diagnosis, and this diagnosis was accurately made during admission. Organic disease, especially genetic disease, was often not diagnosed during admission. Better tools are needed to identify patients with organic disease. We identified patient factors on admission associated with ultimate diagnosis, which could be used to prioritize evaluation and expedite follow-up.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^94d70c58]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Faltering growth (FG) in infants and young children (< 2 years of age) is a common problem for general clinicians to see in clinical practice, especially in low-income settings.
FG is associated with a range of adverse outcomes and there may be benefits in promoting catch-up growth where this is indicated.
Health care professionals may be deterred from adequately addressing the problem of growth failure, due to the reported misconception that addressing FG may promote accelerated growth.

### Hypertension: a cause of growth impairment [^aed5f772]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The effects of high blood pressure on growth are not fully understood and while hypertension may be associated with failure to thrive, hypertension causing failure to thrive in children is poorly documented. We describe four children presenting with failure to thrive due to hypertension consequent to various aetiologies. Control of hypertension with appropriate therapy resulted in improved growth. The exact pathogenesis of failure to thrive in hypertensive children is not known. These cases demonstrate the importance of careful measurement of blood pressure in children with failure to thrive.

### Clinician diagnoses of failure to thrive before and after switch to World Health Organization growth curves [^d8f74c24]. Academic Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate change in the incidence of failure to thrive (FTT) based on selected growth percentile criteria and diagnostic codes before and after a switch in growth curves.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of children 2 to 24 months of age in a large primary care network that switched its default growth curve from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards in 2012. We compared the incidence of FTT defined by growth percentile criteria (using the default growth curve at the time of each measurement) and by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes in the 3 years before and after the CDC-WHO switch using an interrupted time series analysis. We performed these analyses stratified by age group (≤ 6 months and > 6–24 months).

Results

We evaluated 83,299 children. Among those ≤ 6 months, increases in FTT incidence were found in both growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05). Among those > 6 to 24 months, decreases in FTT incidence were found by growth-percentile criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05), but no significant changes were found in FTT incidence by diagnostic codes.

Conclusions

When switching from the CDC to the WHO growth curves, changes in the incidence of FTT by growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria differed for younger versus older infants. Factors beyond growth likely influence the decision to diagnose a child as having FTT and may differ in younger compared to older infants.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^66eff670]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — feeding and growth in infancy often require anticipatory support. The guideline notes, "Approximately one-third of infants with TS are born small for gestational age (SGA), though the degree of SGA is typically mild, but can be up to 600–1000 g lighter". It adds, "Inadequate weight gain is common, with estimates of up to half of all infants with TS experiencing failure to thrive", and explains contributory factors: "High arched and narrow palate, hypotonia, poor coordination, and delay in oral-motor skills can all contribute to feeding and/or swallowing difficulties in infants with TS". It also states, "While there are no TS-specific treatment recommendations, anticipatory guidance and proactive intervention are desired".

### Use of energy-dense formula for treating infants with non-organic failure to thrive [^0efc9b4c]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate if simply increasing the energy density of the formula will lead to increased energy intake and weight gain in infants with non-organic failure to thrive.

Design

In this hospital-based trial, 15 infants (mean age, 7.6 ± 1.4 months) with non-organic failure to thrive were fed a regular strength formula (2.8 kJ/ml) for 3 days and then switched to the same formula with a higher energy density (4.18 kJ/ml) for 3 days after a 2 day 'wash-out' period. Daily nude weights and energy intakes were recorded for the two 3 day periods.

Results

During feeding with the higher density formula, nine (60%) infants had a significant increase in their energy intake and weight gain (both P < 0.02); four (27%) showed no change in energy intake and self-regulated their intake by decreasing the volume of feeds consumed to maintain energy intake; and two (13%) infants consumed a significantly reduced amount of energy (P < 0.02).

Conclusion

Increasing the energy density of the formula may provide a useful intervention to increase the weight gain and energy intake of most infants with non-organic failure to thrive.

### Atopic dermatitis-induced failure to thrive and hypernatremic dehydration managed with dupilumab in a 5-month-old patient [^76e73bf7]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by genetics, environmental factors, epidermal barrier disruption, and immune dysregulation. Rarely, severe AD induces skin barrier dysfunction resulting in protein deficiency and electrolyte abnormalities, ultimately causing failure to thrive (FTT). This case features a 5-month-old female who presented with altered consciousness due to electrolyte abnormalities, poor feeding, weight loss, and subsequent FTT. After extensive investigation, she was diagnosed with severe AD and initiated on dupilumab. This case highlights the rare sequelae of severe AD and the use of biologic therapies for infants with severe or refractory cases of AD.

### Late preterm birth is a risk factor for growth faltering in early childhood: a cohort study [^ccc8e281]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Late preterm children have already shown to be at increased risk of dying during infancy. Results of the current study bring a new source of concern: for those who survive, high morbidity continues and failure to thrive in the first two years may put them at increased risk of future occurrences of serious morbidity in late childhood and of chronic disease development in adult life.

### Disease severity at time of referral for pediatric failure to thrive and obesity: time for a paradigm shift? [^f76b46ce]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The percent of ideal body weight at first visit to pediatric referral clinics was compared by chart review between patients with failure to thrive and obese patients. Results indicated that underweight children were mildly underweight, whereas the overweight children were severely so. In primary care settings, underweight children may be referred more aggressively than overweight children.

### Neglect: failure to thrive and obesity [^9e1ff6ff]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Medical providers need to monitor growth at every visit. Weight status is influenced by genetics, medical conditions, socioeconomic status, and family environment. Screening for food security and psychosocial risk factors is an integral tool to identify families at risk for nutritional deficits and child maltreatment. Nutritional rehabilitation is best accomplished in an outpatient, multidisciplinary setting. Medical neglect should be considered in failure to thrive and obesity when there is a serious risk of harm from identified medical complications, additional or worsening medical complications occurring despite a multidisciplinary approach, and/or non-adherence with the treatment plan.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^d4b5709b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Faltering Growth

There are many definitions of FG (also referred to by other terms including growth faltering, "failure to thrive", stunting, and growth failure). For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the National Health Service in the UK, suggested the following thresholds for concern about FG in infants: a fall across 1 or more weight centile spaces (1 centile space = 0.67 z scores) if birthweight was below the 9th centile; a fall across 2 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was between the 9th and 91st centiles; a fall across 3 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was above the 91st centile; when current weight is below the 2nd centile for age, whatever the birthweight.

Given the international nature of this review, the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of growth faltering seems most relevant to provide a simple, pragmatic approach for clinicians: a fall in weight for age (WFA) z score of ≥ 1.0 merits evaluation. Current definitions lack a timeframe for the period of growth faltering. We suggested that it was important to include a time frame for falling weight that should be sufficient to ensure that acute weight loss, such as that occurring rapidly with an episode of vomiting and diarrhea is not classified as growth faltering. Growth faltering also excludes the first 2 weeks after birth, when weight loss is expected.

Growth faltering potentially has an immediate effect on a child's health and can be a marker for something serious, so it is clearly important that clinicians recognize growth faltering and manage it appropriately.

### The public health challenge of early growth failure in India [^1f42aa97]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Recent recognition of the early onset and high prevalence of wasting (30%) and stunting (20%) among infants 0–5 months in India draws attention to the need to understand the causes and develop prevention strategies. Such growth failure has dire consequences in the short (increased mortality) and long-term (loss of human capital and increased risk of chronic diseases). Food interventions before 6 months will increase morbidity/mortality through contamination in settings of poor sanitation and hygiene. Waiting to improve nutrition only after the initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months is a missed opportunity and may permanently alter life trajectory and potential. This underscores the importance of maternal nutrition. Iron and folic acid and protein energy supplementation during pregnancy are interventions that can improve maternal nutrition and birth outcomes. Maternal supplementation during lactation should be considered as a means to improve maternal and child outcomes, although the evidence needs strengthening. Support and counseling are also required to improve maternal diets and promote exclusive breastfeeding. Programs focused on improving maternal nutrition across the continuum of preconception, pregnancy and lactation are likely to have the greatest impact as mothers are central gatekeepers to the health and future of their children.

### Failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, and diarrhea in a 7-week-old infant [^98cb9b07]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A 7-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with fussiness, decreased oral intake, loose stool, and respiratory distress for 2 days. The patient was born full-term with an uncomplicated birth history but had a history of slow weight gain. He was alert, but toxic-appearing at presentation, hypothermic with signs of dehydration, and with respiratory failure. He was found to have severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, elevated lactate, and hyperammonemia. He responded well to initial resuscitation and was admitted to the ICU for intravenous electrolyte replacement, bowel rest, and respiratory support. A workup was pursued for failure to thrive with severe malnutrition, hyperammonemia, hyperlactatemia, anemia, vitamin D deficiency, and electrolyte abnormalities. After stabilization, he was restarted on enteral feeds and had a recurrence of loose stool and severe electrolyte abnormalities, which were refractory to enteral supplementations and required readmission to the ICU. His hospital course extended several weeks, included several subspecialty consultations, and ended with a surprising diagnosis of exclusion based on his clinical response to therapy.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^5306dd80]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Both twins had the classic~2.5 Mb deletion between low copy repeat sections A–D, the most common form of 22q11.2DS, affecting genes such as TBX1 and DGCR6. These genes are crucial in the development of the pharyngeal apparatus and cardiac progenitor cells, correlating with the syndrome's characteristic features. In this case, it is suspected that the disruption of the pharyngeal apparatus contributed to the twins' aspiration and FTT. Another teaching point to be made is the role of gastrostomy tube placement in addressing FTT, secondary to a genetic cause. As shown in the figures, the use of a gastronomy tube helps children with 22q11.2DS achieve higher growth velocity and return to their expected weight, reducing the risk of developmental delays due to poor nutrition.

Consent was obtained from the family for the authoring and publication of this case.

Learning points

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has a varied presentation and can have delayed or absent presentation of the classic features.
In a child presenting for concerns of failure to thrive and aspiration, 22q11.2DS should be introduced into the differential, especially when the common aetiologies have been ruled out.
Early interventions can minimise the impact of 22q11.2DS on the lives of affected patients.

### The diagnosis "failure to thrive" and its impact on the care of hospitalized older adults: a matched case-control study [^840e4017]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

"Failure to thrive", or FTT, is a nonspecific term commonly applied to older adults in the emergency room when there is uncertainty over the cause of their presentation to hospital. This term was adopted from pediatrics in the 1970's, and over the years, has come to represent a syndrome of vague symptoms among older adults that includes unexplained loss of appetite, weight loss, cognitive and functional decline, and social isolation, complicated by multiple medical comorbidities and psychiatric factors. Despite the wide range of symptoms the term encompasses, and the lack of consensus in its definition, the term has been adopted into the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) since 1979 and continues to be commonly used in clinical practice.

The prevalence of FTT and related terms has not been quantified, however there has been a general trend of an increasing number of older adults presenting to healthcare, as their prevalence increases in the general population. Concurrently, emergency department (ED) wait times, allocation of hospital resources, and the evolution of interdisciplinary care are at the forefront of healthcare discussions. Observational studies have shown that the emphasis on wait times and speed of patient flow as part of a "performance management approach" in resource allocation have shifted importance to efficiency rather than safe, patient-centered care. It has been postulated that FTT and "failure to cope" are being used as labels of expediency to imply predominantly social issues, rather than medical issues, as the reason for admission.

Studies have also suggested that labels are powerful in the healthcare setting and may alter how patients are perceived. An earlier retrospective cohort study hypothesized that acute medical illness rather than social factors is the primary reason for admission for patients labeled as FTT, as the majority of patients in this study received an extensive medical workup and interventions such as intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

To date, there have been no studies looking at potential harms that may occur when patients are admitted with a diagnosis of FTT and associated labels. The main objective of our study is to investigate the effect of such labeling on the admission process through the ED as a proxy for measuring delivery of care. We also sought to determine the concordance of the FTT admission diagnosis with the diagnosis at the time of discharge to determine if this label was maintained throughout the hospital admission. We hypothesized that this diagnostic label would be associated with delays in care and that many patients admitted with the FTT label would be later found to have acute medical diagnoses.

### 'Severe malnutrition': thinking deeply, communicating simply [^b0566baf]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Severe malnutrition

By Severe Malnutrition we mean (Table 2):

Table 2
Severe malnutrition definition

Benefits of this term include the following.

Focus on severe adverse outcomes

An important clinical maxim is to 'treat the patient, not the numbers'. The ultimate aim of any intervention is to ensure children not only survive but thrive. Severe in our framework refers to clinically important severe adverse outcomes: mortality, morbidity, impaired development. To capture true programme impact, these should be measured wherever possible (since some interventions might improve anthropometry but not mortality; others improve nutrition but not anthropometry). The framework also highlights underlying clinical causes because acute/chronic illness and anthropometric deficits are intimately related: deficits are associated with increased risk of and impaired response to illnesses; illness can exacerbate anthropometric deficit.

Inclusivity (including of long-term consequences)

Different manifestations of malnutrition are more-common or less-common/important in different settings but details are mainly relevant to technical audiences. While widely understood to mean undernutrition, we acknowledge that malnutrition is also used to describe overweight. Severe overweight is widely recognised as obesity so our using 'severe malnutrition' does not risk misunderstanding. It does create opportunities to highlight long term consequences of undernutrition: speaking about mal rather than under nutrition is a reminder that early-life undernutrition increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of adult overweight, especially elevated non-communicable non-communicable disease.

Increased linkages and synergies between different nutrition-related programmes

Working towards common mortality/morbidity goals could facilitate interprogramme linkages and more efficient resource utilisation.

'Severe malnutrition' also provides bridging language supporting recent research on relationships between different malnutrition manifestations:

Wasting predisposes to stunting — 'chronic' terminology under-recognises the role of acute insults.
Wasting is common in children with low birth weight and disabilityand many wasted children are stunted — 'acute' terminology is usually erroneous.
Children with concurrent wasting/stunting are at particularly high risk of death — programmes should be integrated.

Since all forms of malnutrition are fundamentally social problems of poverty and inequity, our terminology also emphasises the importance of tackling these common determinants.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^f92d60a1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

DISEASE-RELATED FG

Failure to thrive or FG may be the presenting symptom in a wide range of diseases, so inadequate weight gain and/or decreasing growth velocity for age should be considered as an early disease symptom in an otherwise apparently healthy child. The mechanisms of nutrient imbalance in disease-related FG include:

Reduced or restricted intake, due to sucking and swallowing disorders; insufficient intake from secondary anorexia (eg, cardiac and/or lung diseases, cancer, cerebral palsy); eating disorders.
Excessive losses, due to vomiting; intestinal malabsorption (eg, untreated celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, cholestasis, or intestinal failure including short bowel syndrome, intractable diarrhea, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction); protein-losing enteropathy (eg, intestinal lymphangiectasia, inflammatory bowel disease; severe dermatologic disease).
Increased requirements due to infection and inflammation (eg, pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hemato-oncologic, neurologic, endocrine diseases).

Static data (only 1 measurement of weight and height) is available on acute and chronic malnutrition in children admitted to hospital but there is no definitive data on FG, which requires dynamic data, at least 2 or 3 previous growth measurements over time. In reality, disease-related FG is likely to have started some time before hospital admission in most cases.

Current studies report very different rates of disease-related malnutrition according to hospital type and size, methodology, and the population selection. Illness-related malnutrition prevalence ranging from 6% to 51% has been reported in hospitalized children. The prevalence of malnutrition varies depending on the underlying medical or surgical conditions, with the highest prevalence in patients with multiple diagnoses and neurologic diseases (up to 44%). Disease-related FG/malnutrition also occurs frequently in patients with infectious diseases, cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, oncologic diseases, and with gastrointestinal diseases. Critically ill children are at a particularly high risk of developing malnutrition and studies have shown that 14%–32% of infants admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) have acute or chronic malnourishment on admission. It is important that pediatricians and nutritionists are alert to the risk of malnutrition and assess and monitor malnutrition as an important prognostic factor, in children admitted to hospital. Identifying those at risk is essential and could be helped by using validated nutritional risk scores/tools (eg, PYMS, STAMP, or STRONGkids).

### Osteopathic treatment of infants with infantile colic / excessive crying: a prospective, multicentric, randomized controlled trial and nested observational trial [^4649564f]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colic in infants is defined as excessive crying in an otherwise healthy and thriving baby. In the literature, this health disorder is often referred to as infantile colic (IC) / excessive crying (EC). The crying typically starts in the first weeks of life and usually resolves within 6 months. IC/EC is a common but poorly understood and often frustrating problem for parents and caregivers. Although IC/EC is classified as benign and self-limiting, it is one of the most common causes of medical consultations in the first months of a child's life due to the excessive crying and the accompanying distressing impairment to parents.

Definitions

Three types of infant crying are distinguished: physiological crying (due to physical and emotional needs), pathological crying (due to organic causes), and nonspecific crying (without an apparently reasonable cause). To date, however, there is no exact definition for IC/EC, which makes it difficult to compare different studies and scientific papers on this topic. Traditionally, the definition of IC/EC was based on the "rule of three": unexplained episodes of paroxysmal crying for more than three hours per day for three days per week for at least three weeks. The Rome III Committee describes IC/EC as a behavioral syndrome in infancy that involves prolonged crying episodes and behavior that is difficult to soothe, without an obvious cause, and without failure to thrive.

Epidemiology

Reported incidence rates of IC/EC vary between 2% and 40%, not least because of differences in the criteria used to define the condition. Twenty-one percent of UK families report having sought advice for persistent infant crying. A review by Vandenplas et al. identified 30 studies that reported a prevalence of IC or crying problems ranging from 2% to 73% in infants younger than 12 months of age. In a meta-analysis by Wolke et al. pooled estimates of IC/EC cry duration were 117 min at 1–2 weeks of age, 118 min at 3–4 weeks, 133 min at 5–6 weeks, followed by a significant decrease to 68 min at 10–12 weeks of age.

### Oesophageal eosinophilia and oesophageal diseases in children: are the limits clear? [^5d95cda2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Clinical aspects

In paediatric patients, diagnostic guidance based on symptoms is difficult, especially at younger ages, when symptoms are more non-specific, and generally reported by caregivers, and therefore depend on their interpretation.

EoE is suspected clinically when there are symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction, which could manifest in various ways, including dysphagia, food impaction, food refusal, failure to progress with food introduction, heartburn, regurgitation, vomiting, chest pain, odynophagia, abdominal pain and malnutrition. Atopic comorbidities such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, or immediate food allergies should increase the clinical index of suspicion. In younger children, the most common symptoms are those similar to GER, in addition to vomiting, abdominal pain, food refusal and failure to thrive. In older children, adolescents and adults, dysphagia to solids, food impaction and chest pain not associated with swallowing are more frequently reported. Because these symptoms are non-specific, patients should be treated as clinically indicated. The diagnostic algorithm cannot anticipate all clinical possibilities, and provides scope for appropriate evaluation.

Among the most frequent symptoms that may be associated with GERD in infants and children are general manifestations (irritability, food refusal, failure to thrive), gastrointestinal manifestations (heartburn, regurgitation/vomiting, retrosternal chest pain, dysphagia, epigastric pain) and manifestations of the airway (cough, wheezing, stridor, apnoea episodes, asthma, pneumonia). Given that the symptoms of GERD are not specific, 'red flags' or warning signs have been defined to guide the need for research studies to rule out complications of GERD and underlying disorders with similar symptoms. It should be noted that GER in infants is very common, and is usually self-limiting. In the presence of an infant with recurrent regurgitation, a thorough history and physical examination with attention to warning signals suggesting other diagnoses is generally sufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated infant GER. In the absence of warning signs, diagnostic testing and/or therapies including acid suppression are not needed if there is no impact of the symptoms on feeding, growth or acquisition of developmental milestones. Referral to the paediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when in infants or children there are warning signs or symptoms suggesting an underlying gastrointestinal disease.

### Evaluation of income and food insecurity as risk factors for failure to thrive: an analysis of national survey data [^94220caf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In some children with borderline low weight or rate of weight gain it can be difficult to determine whether they have some degree of undernourishment, also known as failure to thrive (FTT). For these children, a clinician must determine whether the child is healthy and small or has FTT. Socioeconomic status (SES) and food insecurity have often been considered to play a role in children having FTT, mediated by factors such as caregiver stress and a lower amount of food offered. - There is no widely accepted definition of FTT in the United States, and no protocol for diagnosing FTT. Anecdotally, many pediatricians report considering SES when making a multifactorial assessment of children with slow weight gain, and some experts have recommended doing so. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a higher prevalence of multiple conditions. However, there is limited evidence to support an association between low SES and an increased prevalence of FTT, or to support an association between low SES and an increased prevalence of underweight which could reflect a higher risk of FTT. A recent systematic review found conflicting evidence on the topic, with little data from the United States.- Furthermore, a recent prospective study in the United States did not find an increase in underweight prevalence in children with public insurance experiencing food insecurity in tertiary centers in 5 US cities.

It is important to understand factors that do or do not provide information about the risk of FTT because underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of FTT both have potential harms. Evaluations of children with FTT sometimes include costly testing and can involve detailed questioning about parenting practices or home visits. Management of FTT may involve strict feeding routines, purchase of specific foods, and frequent in-person follow-up, all of which may be more challenging for families with less money and control over their schedules or with fewer transportation options. Underdiagnosis of FTT may also disproportionately affect children with lower SES because they are at higher risk of poor outcomes from some medical conditions. Socioeconomic status and food insecurity are also associated with race and ethnicity, leading to the potential for further health care disparities if children with these risk factors are overidentified, or underidentified, as having FTT. -

We used a nationally representative US sample to determine whether there was a higher prevalence of children with underweight in children with low income, a component of SES, or food insecurity, compared to those without. A higher prevalence of underweight in these children would likely reflect a higher risk of FTT.

### Failure to thrive: a prospective study in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic [^eadeac4c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic work-up, interventions, and outcomes of children referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic with the diagnosis of failure to thrive (FTT).

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 110 children seen for the first time in our pediatric gastroenterology clinic for FTT. Standard demographic information, history, and anthropometric data were collected at initial and follow-up visits. We also obtained data about diagnostic workup, therapeutic interventions, and growth outcomes.

Results

Seventy patients (63.6%) were boys with a median age of 0.79 years (interquartile range 0.36–1.98). Of the 91 children with follow-up data, 81 (89%) were found to have nonorganic etiologies of their FTT. The majority of children (56.4%) underwent laboratory evaluation. Imaging and endoscopic evaluations were performed in fewer patients (29.6 and 10.2%, respectively). Endoscopic intervention yielded a diagnosis in 16.7% of patients while the positive result rates for laboratory testing and imaging were 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively. The most common therapeutic interventions included increasing calories (71.8%), avoiding grazing (71.8%), and structuring meals and snacks (67.3%). Compared with nonadherent children, children who were adherent with standard behavioral and nutritional interventions showed a higher positive change in z scores for weight (0.36 vs -0.01, P = 0.001) and body mass index (0.58 vs -0.18, P = 0.031).

Conclusions

The majority of children in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic with FTT have nonorganic etiologies of their failure to thrive. Laboratory, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation are rarely positive and should be judiciously performed. Adherence to standardized interventions leads to improved growth.

### Giant cardiac fibroma: an unusual cause of failure to thrive [^029e1ecd]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac fibromas are extremely rare in the general pediatric population and may present with a wide spectrum of clinical signs, including life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. We report a 14-month-old boy who presented with failure to thrive as the only symptom. Echocardiography showed a large cardiac fibroma in the right ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. After complete surgical tumor resection, the boy showed normal catch-up growth. This case underlines the diversity of clinical features of cardiac tumors, which implies that they should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of infants with failure to thrive.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^3527b61e]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease-related FG can have serious short- and long-term consequences. Critically ill children who become malnourished during PICU stay show increased mortality, length of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. Malnourished children also have increased rates of infection and longer-term behavioral problems, including impaired communication skills, attention-deficit, and hyperactivity disorders. However, most data on the adverse effects of malnutrition come from studies carried out in low-income countries, with very limited data on the long-term effects of FG in children in Western countries, although there is some evidence in children with congenital heart disease.

Considering the long-term consequences of FG, investigators relying on population- and community-based samples have found that most children with a history of FG have experienced growth recovery by school age. Although many continue to be shorter than age-matched peers they rarely experience growth deficits indicative of severe malnutrition. However, FG may have a small, though potentially important, impact on children's cognitive performance. A meta-analysis in 2004 suggested that FG in infants may result in long-term problems in cognitive development with a 4.2 intelligence quotient point decrement. In another study, young children who had failure to thrive followed for up to 8 years had measurable intelligence quotient deficits as well as learning and behavioral difficulties. Chronic illness leading to stunting may have consequences on long-term growth and final size/target size and if FG caused by disease is not corrected it can develop into non-disease-related FG.

### Incidence of refeeding syndrome in children with failure to thrive [^a06d0368]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the incidence of refeeding syndrome in otherwise healthy children < 3 years of age admitted for failure to thrive (FTT).

Methods

A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed on patients aged ≤ 36 months admitted with a primary diagnosis of FTT from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with laboratory evidence of refeeding syndrome. Exclusion criteria included admission to an ICU, parenteral nutrition, history of prematurity, gastrostomy tube feeds, and any complex chronic conditions.

Results

Of the 179 patients meeting inclusion criteria, none had laboratory evidence of refeeding syndrome. Of these, 145 (81%) had laboratory work done at the time of admission, and 69 (39%) had laboratory work repeated after admission. A small percentage (6%) of included patients experienced an adverse event due to repeat laboratory draw.

Conclusions

In otherwise healthy hospitalized patients < 3 years of age with a primary diagnosis of FTT, routine laboratory monitoring for electrolyte derangements did not reveal any cases of refeeding syndrome. More robust studies are needed to determine the safety and feasibility of applying low-risk guidelines to this patient population to reduce practice variability and eliminate unnecessary laboratory evaluation and monitoring.

### A 3-month-old with failure to thrive and persistent vomiting [^785cba8f]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 3-month-old boy was admitted from his pediatrician's office for failure to thrive and vomiting. On admission, he weighed barely more than his birth weight and was cachectic with muscle wasting. His abdomen was grossly distended but soft and nontender. A trial of nasogastric feeds resulted in a worsening of his clinical status. He was transferred to the ICU, and diagnostic imaging was concerning for a distal bowel obstruction. Surgical pathology revealed a surprising diagnosis, which is described in detail in the following case.

### Biallelic truncating variants incause a novel neurodevelopmental disorder involving postnatal microcephaly and failure to thrive [^ba63efe8]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study identified homozygous loss-of-function variants in ATP9A as the cause of a novel neurodevelopmental disorder associated with NDD/ID, POM, failure to thrive and gastrointestinal symptoms. Complex neurodevelopmental and behavioural disabilities, including poor fine motor skills, restriction of expressive language, attention deficit, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep patterns are common features in children with POM. The affected individuals in this study displayed NDD/ID and POM of variable degrees. Individuals A-II-1 and A-II-2 had mild ID, whereas individual B-II-1 was severely affected. Individuals A-II-1 and A-II-2 showed impaired fine motor skills, an attention deficit, hyperactivity and sleep disturbances. All three patients had feeding difficulties in infancy, showed gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. unclear emesis, gastritis and gastro-oesophageal reflux) and suffered from failure to thrive. Furthermore, individuals A-II-1 and B-II-1 displayed short stature.

### Preoperative determinants of outcomes of infant heart surgery in a limited-resource setting [^33b5ed83]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

We studied the effect of preoperative determinants on early outcomes of 1028 consecutive infant heart operations in a limited-resource setting. Comprehensive data on pediatric heart surgery (January 2010-December 2012) were collected prospectively. Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality, prolonged ventilation (> 48 hours), and bloodstream infection (BSI) after surgery. Preoperative variables that showed significant individual association with outcome measures were entered into a logistic regression model. Weight at birth was low in 224 infants (21.8%), and failure to thrive was common (mean-weight Z score at surgery was 2.72 ± 1.7). Preoperatively, 525 infants (51%) needed intensive care, 69 infants (6.7%) were ventilated, and 80 infants (7.8%) had BSI. In-hospital mortality (4.1%) was significantly associated with risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery-1 (RACHS-1) risk category (P < 0.001). Neonatal status, preoperative BSI, and requirement of preoperative intensive care and ventilation had significant individual association with adverse outcomes, whereas low birth weight, prematurity, and severe failure to thrive (weight Z score < -3) were not associated with adverse outcomes. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, preoperative sepsis (odds ratio = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.32–6.21; P = 0.008) was associated with mortality. Preoperative intensive care unit stay, ventilation, BSI, and RACHS-1 category were associated with prolonged postoperative ventilation and postoperative sepsis. Neonatal age group was additionally associated with postoperative sepsis. Although severe failure to thrive was common, it did not adversely affect outcomes. In conclusions, preoperative BSI, preoperative intensive care, and mechanical ventilation are strongly associated with adverse outcomes after infant cardiac surgery in this large single-center experience from a developing country. Failure to thrive and low birth weight do not appear to adversely affect surgical outcomes.

### Early intervention and recovery among children with failure to thrive: follow-up at age 8 [^a6d08708]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to examine the impact of a randomized, controlled trial of home visiting among infants with failure to thrive on growth, academic/cognitive performance, and home/classroom behavior at age 8.

Methods

Infants with failure to thrive (N = 130) or adequate growth (N = 119) were recruited from pediatric primary care clinics serving low-income, urban communities. Eligibility criteria included age < 25 months, gestational age > 36 weeks, birth weight > 2500 g, and no significant medical conditions. Evaluation included anthropometries, Bayley scales, maternal anthropometries, demographics, negative affect, IQ, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. Infants with failure to thrive were treated in an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition clinic and randomized into clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention or clinical-care-only groups. The home-visiting curriculum promoted maternal sensitivity, parent-infant relationships, and child development. Follow-up visits were conducted by evaluators who were unaware of the children's growth or intervention history. At age 8, the evaluation included anthropometries, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, and the Wide Range Achievement Test, Revised. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist and teachers completed the Teacher Report Form.

Analysis

Multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine differences in growth, cognitive/academic performance, and home/school behavior, adjusted by maternal education, public assistance, and, when appropriate, infant Bayley score, maternal BMI, height, negative affect, IQ, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scores.

Results

Retention was 74% to 78%. Children in the adequate-growth group were significantly taller, heavier, and had better arithmetic scores than the clinical-intervention-only group, with the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group intermediate. There were no group differences in IQ, reading, or mother-reported behavior problems. Children in the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group had fewer teacher-reported internalizing problems and better work habits than the clinical-intervention-only group.

Conclusions

Early failure to thrive increased children's vulnerability to short stature, poor arithmetic performance, and poor work habits. Home visiting attenuated some of the negative effects of early failure to thrive, possibly by promoting maternal sensitivity and helping children build strong work habits that enabled them to benefit from school. Findings provide evidence for early intervention programs for vulnerable infants.

### Diencephalic syndrome: a rare cause of failure to thrive [^fcbcf11c]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Timely diagnosis of diencephalic syndrome is not often the case for patients presenting with failure to thrive (FTT) because of its rarity and lack of specific symptoms. Herein, we report two cases of diencephalic syndrome (2-year-old girl and 10-month-old boy) presenting with severe emaciation. Both patients had histories of poor weight gain for months despite having good appetites prior to diagnosis. Initial work-up did not reveal the diagnosis. Horizontal nystagmus was noted in both patients: by a neurologist in the first patient and by a family member in the second patient. MRI of the brain showed large suprasellar mass and pilocytic astrocytoma was confirmed by pathology in each case. The patients were started on appropriate chemotherapy with interval improvements in weight gain. These cases illustrate the importance of cranial imaging and consideration of diencephalic syndrome for children presenting with FTT despite normal or increased caloric intake.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^fac24e48]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #10 — definitions and breastfeeding-related risks in late preterm and early term infants — states that infants born between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation are designated as late preterm, and that establishing breastfeeding in the late preterm infant is often more difficult compared with the full-term infant born at ≥ 39 weeks of gestation; a growing body of literature has documented an increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to feeding problems, and hospital readmission within the first 7–10 days after discharge is almost always due to feeding-related problems (hyperbilirubinemia, failure to thrive, hypernatremia, and/or dehydration).

### Creating child-inclusive societies [^8e101d2f]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

In a global landscape defined by polycrisis, children are being failed. To address this failure, we ask an ambitious yet fundamental question: how do we create child-inclusive societies where every child thrives and has the best start in life, where intergenerational disadvantage is redressed, and where child poverty is ended? Building on the power of the social determinants of health in advancing equity and human wellbeing, we argue that child inclusiveness requires three foundational actions linked to the political, commercial, and social determinants of health: (1) prioritising implementation of transformative collaboration between policy makers, public bodies, and communities to improve outcomes for children; (2) reclaiming the public good through child-centred regulatory frameworks that aim to deliver health care and improve wellbeing; and (3) valuing the time to care for children and to build meaningful and responsive relationships with them. With innovative thinking about our societies and their core values, we can design child-inclusive interventions and derive relevant metrics and indicators to track progress.

### Classic bartter syndrome: a rare cause of failure to thrive in a child [^bb97e078]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Bartter syndrome is a group of rare autosomal-recessive disorders caused by a defect in distal tubule transport of sodium and chloride. Blood gases and plasma electrolytes raise suspicion of this diagnosis and the definitive diagnosis is made by genetic study. Early treatment improves prognosis. The authors present the case of an 11-month-old child with early failure to thrive and severe regurgitation. Blood gases revealed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Blood pressure was normal and polyuria was documented. She began therapy with potassium chloride supplementation and indomethacin. There was clinical improvement and plasma potassium and bicarbonate normalised. The molecular study confirmed it was the classic form of Bartter syndrome. Despite being rare in clinical practice, which may lead to unnecessary medical investigation and diagnosis delay, in a child with failure to thrive, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, this diagnosis must be considered.

### Hereditary hypotonia, muscle weakness, failure to thrive, and cognitive delay in a large moslem kindred [^6a2d62ae]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Five infants of a Moslem-Arab extended family were evaluated for common and characteristic clinical findings of failure to thrive, extreme muscle weakness, severe motor delay, and moderate to severe cognitive and verbal delay. All children were below the third percentile in weight and height, and three of them had head circumference below the third percentile. Neurologic examination revealed severe hypotonia, muscle weakness, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Two children died at 2 years of age, and none of the children acquired full head control and the motor milestones of rolling and sitting. Laboratory evaluation including muscle biopsies, genetic studies, and metabolic evaluation was nondiagnostic.

### Kearns-Sayre syndrome presenting as isolated growth failure [^4196d8de]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Failure to thrive arises from a heterogeneous group of paediatric disorders including defects in energy metabolism such as mitochondrial diseases. Illustrating this, we describe a girl with poor growth who eluded diagnosis until she developed characteristics of Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Her history emphasises that defects of energy metabolism can present as isolated growth failure.

### Sociodemographic differences of hospitalization and associations of resource utilization for failure to thrive [^b1b87f00]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study examines the sociodemographic differences between elective and nonelective admissions for failure to thrive (FTT). We investigate associations between admission type and hospital resource utilization, including length of stay and feeding tube placement.

Methods

We included children < 2 years old with FTT in the nationwide Kids' Inpatient Database. We described differences between elective and nonelective admissions using Fisher exact and t tests. To assess associations of admission type and hospital resource utilization, we used negative binomial and logistic regression for length of stay and feeding tube placement, respectively.

Results

In this study of 45,920 admissions (37,224 nonelective vs 8696 elective), we found differences by race and ethnicity, income, and insurance type, among other factors. Compared to elective admissions, nonelective admissions had higher proportions of infants who were Black, Hispanic, and of lower-income. Nonelective admissions were associated with longer lengths of stay (incidence rate ratio 1.46; 95% CI: 1.37–1.55), independent of child age, sex, neighborhood income, insurance, admission day, chronic conditions, and location. Nonelective admissions were associated with lower odds of feeding tube placement compared to elective admissions (adjusted odds ratio 0.62; 0.56–0.68). In the stratified analyses, children of racial and ethnic minority groups admitted nonelectively versus electively had relatively higher odds of feeding tube placement, while White children had relatively lower odds of feeding tube placement.

Conclusion

There are various sociodemographic differences between elective and nonelective FTT admissions. Future research is warranted to elucidate drivers of these differences, particularly those related to racial and ethnic disparities and structural racism.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^8b372cc1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has significant variability in clinical presentation. Cardinal features include congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency and palatal abnormalities, but none are pathognomonic in isolation. Features can be classified as major or less common and are thought to be linked to the size of the 22.q11 deletion. Historically, syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome were recognised as distinct before a common genetic aetiology was identified. While the original triad of symptoms described in the 1960s included immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism and congenital heart disease, other studies have expanded this list, highlighting conotruncal cardiac anomalies (75–80%), immunodeficiency due to a hypoplastic thymus (up to 75%), palatal abnormalities (65%) and developmental delay as major features. Intermediate features or those that are relatively less common but still significant for the patient's medical care include gastrointestinal issues (30% of patients), hypocalcaemia (greater than 50–65%), renal defects (33%), hearing loss, swallowing dysfunction and behavioural disturbances. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy and early childhood once key features are identified, with confirmatory testing done using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) single nuclear polymorphism array to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence or lack thereof. The higher resolution of whole chromosome genetic microarray can help to detect smaller variations and has grown in favour in diagnosing genetic conditions, especially when a clear clinical picture is not evident. The extensive phenotypic variation in presentation makes it challenging from a diagnostician's standpoint to initiate workup for this condition, especially if it is an intermediate feature that is the presenting symptom in the absence of major features.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is variably cited in 22q11.2DS.FTT may be secondary to the features of the disease, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, aspiration and swallowing difficulties. Short stature has also been cited to be a complication of disease and can be related to the patient's FTT or to growth hormone deficiency. For any patient presenting with FTT, workup consists of evaluating for inadequate intake, malabsorption issues, increased metabolic expenditure secondary to an underlying condition and ultimately a possible genetic aetiology.

This report details the case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twin boys, who were both found to have de novo 22q11.2DS and exhibiting FTT, yet lacking the major features typically seen with the condition.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^600741b9]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — symptoms, snoring prevalence, and risk factors: Symptoms of OSA, which may be subtle or absent in infants, include snoring, noisy respirations, labored breathing, mouth breathing, and profuse sweating, and some infants with OSA will present with failure to thrive, witnessed apnea, and/ or developmental delay. In otherwise normal infants, snoring is present at least 2 days per week in 11.8% and at least 3 days per week in 5.3% of infants. Some infants with OSA may be asymptomatic and have a normal physical examination, yet studies have reported a high incidence of snoring in infants with (26%–44%) and without (22%–26%) OSA. Additional risk factors for infant OSA include prematurity, maternal smoking, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, obesity, and specific medical conditions including laryngomalacia, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular weakness, Down syndrome, achondroplasia, Chiari malformations, and Prader-Willi syndrome.

### Abstract… [^abaf0ee2]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The recognition of growth and developmental problems in infants and children is one of the major challenges facing primary care physicians. Failure to thrive is a common condition of varying etiologies that has been associated with adverse effects on later growth and cognitive development. 1, 2 Primary care physicians need to be able to diagnose and manage FTT promptly to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae. Management Tools The first rule for treating FTT is to identify the underlying cause and correct it. This requires a stepwise approach that is guided by history and response to therapy. Most cases can be managed by nutrition intervention or feeding behavior modification. Children who do not respond may require further evaluation. Two principles that hold true irrespective of the etiology are that all children with FTT need a high-calorie diet for catch-up growth, and all children with FTT need close follow-up.

Usually, children should be followed at least monthly until catch-up growth is demonstrated and the positive trend is maintained. REFERRAL For children who do not respond to initial management, it may be necessary to seek assistance from a subspecialist. Traditionally, a multidisciplinary approach to FTT — using physicians, nurses, dietitians, social workers, and psychologists — has produced better outcomes. 7 This approach may not be practical in all cases, but for children who are not improving because of an undiagnosed medical condition or a particularly challenging social situation, a multidisciplinary approach may be the best answer. 1, 2, 5, 22–24 FTT is more likely a contributing or associated factor to these adverse outcomes, rather than the exclusive cause. There are a limited number of outcome studies on children with FTT, each with different definitions and designs, so it is difficult to comment with certainty on the long-term results of FTT.

25 In addition, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of FTT from those of the high-risk environments in which FTT often occurs. 5, 26. To decrease the risk of adverse effects, it is important to recognize and treat FTT promptly. Early childhood is a critical period for growth and development, and early intervention for any child with FTT will maximize the potential for better outcomes. 22 Given the evidence of long-term problems, all children who have been diagnosed with FTT need to be followed carefully for possible later sequelae.

### The influence of maternal socioeconomic and emotional factors on infant weight gain and weight faltering (failure to thrive): data from a prospective birth cohort [^5aa92987]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To study the influence of maternal socioeconomic and emotional factors on infant weight gain and weight faltering (failure to thrive) in the first year of life.

Methods

The Gateshead Millennium Baby Study is a population birth cohort in northeast England studied prospectively from birth, via parental questionnaires and a health check aged 13 months. Data were collected on maternal education, deprivation, eating attitudes, and depression, using the Edinburgh Post Natal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3 months. Weight gain was assessed using change in weight SD score, conditional on birth weight (Thrive Index); weight faltering was defined as conditional weight gain below the 5th centile.

Results

Of 923 eligible infants born at term, 774 (84%) had both weight and questionnaire data. Replicating a previous finding, both the highest and the lowest levels of deprivation were associated with weight faltering; this was independent of the type of milk feeding. No relation was found with maternal educational status. Maternal eating restraint was unrelated to weight gain. Infants of mothers with high depression symptom scores (EPDS > 12) had significantly slower weight gain and increased rates of weight faltering up to 4 months (relative risk 2.5), especially if they came from deprived families, but by 12 months they were no different from the remainder of the cohort.

Conclusions

In this setting, social and maternal characteristics had little influence on infants' weight gain, apart from a strong, but transient effect of postnatal depression.

### Multidisciplinary guidelines for the care of late preterm infants [^8b0b58ec]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Short-Term Follow-Up Care

Late preterm infants (LPIs) should be seen by their community primary care provider within 1–2 days after transition/discharge from the hospital; the provider should assess the infant's continued stability, review screening results, ensure ongoing safety, and evaluate the adequacy of support systems. LPIs can appear deceptively vigorous on the first day or two after birth prior to transition/discharge. It is not unusual for morbidities common to LPIs to first appear a few days after transition/discharge. If not detected and managed early, these can quickly escalate and lead to re-hospitalization, increased family stress, and even permanent disability and death.

It is especially important that breastfeeding LPIs be seen within a day after transition/discharge because of the feeding challenges so prevalent in this population. Immature feeding patterns, such as uncoordinated suck/swallow/breathe, ineffective milk transfer, and increased sleepiness because of immature brain/central nervous system (CNS) development, may not be apparent until the mother's milk supply increases on postpartum days 2–5. Feeding failure, in both breastfed and formula-fed newborns, can be caused by other morbidities more common in LPIs, such as respiratory distress, cold stress, sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, low muscle tone, and decreased stamina. Congenital heart disease and patent ductus arteriosis, also more common in LPIs, should be considered for any infant with feeding failure.

The community follow-up care provider should have received a copy of the transition/discharge summary from the in-hospital care provider prior to the initial follow-up visit. To guide evaluation, the follow-up care provider should carefully review maternal and infant history, as well as the infant's hospital course, on the first follow-up visit. Because LPIs have many needs and because it is critically important to assess carefully the issues of continued stability, screening, safety, and support, it may be necessary to schedule extra time for follow-up visits of LPIs. Short-term follow-up care should include weekly assessments until the infant reaches 40 weeks of corrected gestational age (GA) (the infant's due date) or is clearly thriving. More frequent visits may be necessary if weight or bilirubin checks are indicated.

### Defining pediatric failure to thrive in the developed world: validation of a semi-objective diagnosis tool [^c7f62bca]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There is no concordance between current diagnostic criteria for failure to thrive (FTT). We analyzed validity of the Semi-Objective Failure to Thrive (SOFTT) diagnosis tool, which uses a combination of subjective and objective components to make the diagnosis of FTT. The tool was used to diagnose FTT in 94 patients who met 1 of 7 accepted criteria for FTT. Concurrent and predictive validity were demonstrated using anthropometric z-scores and change in anthropometric z-scores, respectively. SOFTT results correlated with differences in anthropometric z-scores for length (P = 0.011), weight, weight-for-length, body mass index, mid-upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness (P < .0001) between those diagnosed as normal and those with FTT. At follow-up, children with FTT compared with children rated as normal had significantly higher change in weight (P ≤ .001) and body mass index (P = 0.026) z-scores. The SOFTT tool leads to the accurate diagnosis of FTT demonstrated by concurrent and predictive validity.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^274ea903]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) syndrome — definition elements and required exclusions. The definition includes "(2) respiratory signs (e.g., resting tachypnea, adventitious sounds, retractions, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, or respiratory failure); (3) hypoxemia; and (4) diffuse abnormalities on CXR or a CT scan", and specifies "Abnormalities in pulmonary function are not included, because PFT may not be available, particularly in younger children". It further states, "This definition is sensitive for detecting the presence of a chILD disease, but its specificity has not been determined. The definition also has not been studied prospectively (14)". The syndrome "requires that more common causes of DLD have been excluded", including "cystic fibrosis, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary infection, primary ciliary dyskinesia presenting with newborn respiratory distress, and recurrent aspiration".

### Inhalational lung injury associated with humidifier "white dust" [^3d3a1204]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Humidifiers are commonly used in the community to relieve symptoms associated with acute respiratory infections in young children; however, clear benefits of these devices have not been documented. The Environmental Protection Agency has not found any adverse health effects related to humidifier use. We report here the case of a young infant with significant accidental inhalational lung injury related to dispersal of mineral dust from an ultrasonic home-use humidifier. The clinical consequences included prolonged hypoxemia, tachypnea, and failure to thrive. Radiography revealed pneumonitis, and pulmonary-function testing showed a nonreversible mild obstructive ventilatory defect. Because of persistent symptoms, evolution of failure to thrive, and nonresponse to inhaled and short courses of systemic glucocorticoids, an aggressive management approach was successfully pursued with high-dose pulse steroid therapy, which could be a potential therapeutic approach for similar patients. In addition, this case raises important questions about the safety of exposing infants and young children to humidifiers and emphasizes the need for further study.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^cbfac572]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, posing a diagnostic challenge. When cardinal characteristics, such as conotruncal cardiac anomalies or immunodeficiency, are absent, genetic testing may be delayed, postponing interventions to minimise developmental delay. We present a case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twins diagnosed with de novo 22q11.2DS around 3 months of life, who lacked major characteristics of the disease. Both infants were admitted and discharged multiple times with consistent concerns for failure to thrive (FTT) and aspiration. Twin B was incidentally found to have asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, leading to a 22q11.2DS diagnosis. Twin A had no symptoms other than FTT and aspiration. This case encourages considering 22q11.2DS in the differential diagnosis for FTT, even when classic symptoms are absent or delayed in presentation. Early recognition allows for timely intervention and better outcomes.

### Sensory processing difficulties in toddlers with nonorganic failure-to-thrive and feeding problems [^3aedad05]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Failure-to-thrive is defined as an abnormally low weight and/or height for age. The term "nonorganic failure-to-thrive" (NOFT) has been used to describe "failure-to-thrive" without an obvious cause underlying the growth failure. The purpose of the present study was to compare sensory processing abilities between toddlers with NOFT and feeding problems and age-matched controls.

Methods

Toddlers with NOFT and feeding problems (N = 16) were recruited from the pediatric feeding clinic in a tertiary university hospital, and age-matched controls (N = 16) were recruited from community volunteers. They were evaluated for sensory processing ability using an Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP), and for development of cognition, motor skills, and language using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and Sequenced Language Scale for Infants. Behavior at mealtime was evaluated using the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale.

Results

In the NOFT with feeding problems group, atypical performances were more frequently observed in 3 of 5 ITSP section items (tactile, vestibular, and oral) compared with those in the control group. Significant delayed development of cognition, motor skills, and language was observed in the NOFT with feeding problems group compared with that in the control group. In addition, children who showed 1 or more atypical performances in ITSP had delayed development in cognition, motor skills, and language.

Conclusions

Sensory processing problems were more commonly observed in toddlers with feeding problems and growth deficiency. The present study could provide a preliminary evidence for a possible impact of the sensory processing problems on the feeding difficulties in toddlers with NOFT. Future large studies should be conducted to clarify the relation between sensory processing difficulties and feeding problems in toddlers.

Appendix: Case Vignettes

The following are fictitious case vignettes based on real-life cases and are meant to describe the symptoms that may help differentiate between the different forms of ASMD as well as highlight the difficulty in establishing a proper clinical diagnosis based solely on a patient's genotype.

Case 1: Infantile neurovisceral ASMD

A male infant with Eastern European Jewish ancestry presented at 3 months of age with hepatosplenomegaly. At 4 months of age, notable signs and symptoms included elevated liver transaminases, gastroesophageal reflux, and failure to thrive. In addition, at 4 months of age, the patient was hospitalized for failure to thrive. Hypotonia with poor head control was noted. Enzyme assay for ASM activity was performed at 5 months of age and the diagnosis of ASMD was made. Genotyping showed a common mutation associated with infantile neurovisceral ASMD in patients of Eastern European Jewish ancestry as well as a novel frameshift mutation. At 10 months of age, the patient was unable to sit independently or hold a bottle. The patient had progressive failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, and neurologic deterioration. He died at 2 years of age.

Comment: This is the classic presentation and course for infantile neurovisceral ASMD. The severity of the symptoms at a very young age together with the relevant ancestry should prompt early medical attention and diagnosis.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^ecb73de1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to postnatal infant surveillance (GH therapy), ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate GH treatment in children born SGA with persistent short stature at an age after which catch-up growth is unlikely to occur (at the age of 3–4 years in most children), provided other common causes for short stature have been excluded.

### Normal and abnormal growth in the pediatric patient [^488b84e7]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Proper growth is a marker of the overall health of a child. Growth monitoring in infancy and childhood is a central part of preventative child health programs. For early recognition of pathological causes of growth failure, accurate measurements of height and weight using standardized methods is fundamental. The general pediatrician is a key participant, as he/she provides the auxological data to determine if further testing is needed. This review provides an outline for the general pediatrician for proper auxological measurements, normal variants versus abnormal growth, initial testing for abnormal growth, and when to refer to a pediatric endocrinologist.

### The need for vigilance: the case of a false-negative newborn screen for cystic fibrosis [^0c3c5700]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorder in the white population. CF is caused by abnormalities in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) and may result in severe chronic lung disease, poor growth, and malnutrition. Physicians often do not consider CF in the differential diagnosis of an infant with failure to thrive in the presence of a negative newborn screening (NBS) result. In Minnesota, newborn infants are screened for CF by immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) testing followed by DNA analysis if the IRT screen result is abnormal. All positive NBS results are followed by confirmatory sweat-testing by pilocarpine iontophoresis. We present here the case of a 1-month-old white boy with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and severe malnutrition. Minnesota state CF NBS results were negative at birth (IRT: 43 ng/mL [96% cutoff value: 52 ng/mL]). Clinical symptoms resulted in sweat-testing by Gibson-Cooke pilocarpine iontophoresis at 1 month of age, and the result was positive (102 mmol Cl(-)/L [normal: ≤ 30 mmol Cl(-)/L]). CFTR mutation analysis confirmed a homozygous f508del genotype, and stool pancreatic elastase testing revealed severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This case represents the first known false-negative result in Minnesota since the initiation of NBS for CF in 2006, which illustrates the importance of considering CF in the evaluation of an infant with failure to thrive and symptoms of malabsorption, regardless of NBS results.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^c7557ab6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis — symptoms across ages and diagnostic considerations: For the first step, symptoms vary by age; in adolescents and adults, dysphagia and food impaction are most common, although heartburn and chest pain can be present as well, while in infants and young children, poor growth, failure to thrive, feeding intolerance, failure to progress to solid foods, increased time needed for eating, or food refusal can be seen, and in school-aged children, abdominal pain, vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn are common. All symptoms of EoE are non-specific and have a broad differential diagnosis, and special attention should be paid when eliciting symptoms of dysphagia because patients can use food avoidance and modification behaviors to minimize these symptoms over long periods, leading to diagnostic delays.

### A 7-month-old boy with failure to thrive [^d0402fcc]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes, making their diagnosis challenging. GM1 gangliosidosis is one of the rare subtypes of LSD with an autosomal recessive inheritance and neuro‐somatic manifestations that can manifest as infantile (type I), juvenile (type II) or rarely adult forms affecting children or adults (type III). The disease is lethal in the infantile and juvenile forms. Infantile form presents with hypotonia and developmental delay between birth and 6 months of life. Type II (late infantile or juvenile form) presents with lag in motor and cognitive development, between 7 months and 3 years. Type III adult or chronic variant has a late onset (3–30 years) with milder clinical manifestations that include progressive extrapyramidal signs due to local deposition of glycosphingolipid in the caudate nucleus. The underlying cause of GM1 gangliosidosis is a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal acid β‐galactosidase leading to accumulation of GM1 gangliosides and related glycoconjugates in the lysosomes resulting in lysosomal swelling, cellular damage, and organ dysfunction. The severity of each type is inversely related to the residual activity of the mutant enzyme. Historically, clinical manifestations and brain dysfunction have all been attributed to accumulation of ganglioside in different tissues and particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the exact mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis are incompletely understood. Folkerth and colleagues have proposed an indirect role of this metabolic defect in myelin development and delayed myelination as possible patho‐mechanisms in autopsy cases of infantile GM1 gangliosidosis. Clinical features, such as coarse facial features, gingival hypertrophy, corneal clouding, cherry‐red macula, skeletal dysplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, vacuolated lymphocytes, in addition to a history of psychomotor regression raises the clinical suspicion of GM1 gangliosidosis. Conventional clinical clues, histopathology, electron microscopy and enzymatic assays with fibroblast culture are time‐tested techniques helpful in diagnosing these disorders.

### Failure to thrive in infants with complicated facial hemangiomas [^6bc98c19]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

We have observed that some children with facial hemangiomas of infancy have feeding difficulties coincident with periods of failure to thrive. We evaluated the early oral sensory and feeding experiences of four children with facial hemangiomas through medical record review and parental surveys to investigate their contribution to the patients' failure to thrive. All children with feeding irregularities experienced some degree of oral sensory impairment and required early oral sensory intervention, but there were varying reports of difficulty or delay in the development of oral feeding. The nature of these difficulties is discussed. Infants with complicated facial hemangiomas with perioral and airway involvement may be at higher risk for feeding and oral sensory problems. We recommend close monitoring for failure to thrive and early evaluation by speech or occupational therapists.

### Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy [^cfded648]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food-induced allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FAs) account for an unknown proportion of food allergies and include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Non-IgE-GI-FAs are separate clinical entities but have many overlapping clinical and histologic features among themselves and with eosinophilic gastroenteropathies. Over the past decade, FPIES has emerged as the most actively studied non-IgE-GI-FA, potentially because of acute and distinct clinical features. FPIAP remains among the common causes of rectal bleeding in infants, while classic infantile FPE is rarely diagnosed. The overall most common allergens are cow's milk and soy; in patients with FPIES, rice and oat are also common. The most prominent clinical features of FPIES are repetitive emesis, pallor, and lethargy; chronic FPIES can lead to failure to thrive. FPIAP manifests with bloody stools in well-appearing young breast-fed or formula-fed infants. Features of FPE are nonbloody diarrhea, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive. Non-IgE-GI-FAs have a favorable prognosis; the majority resolve by 1 year in patients with FPIAP, 1 to 3 years in patients with FPE, and 1 to 5 years in patients with FPIES, with significant differences regarding specific foods. There is an urgent need to better define the natural history of FPIES and the pathophysiology of non-IgE-GI-FAs to develop biomarkers and novel therapies.

### Growth trajectories and oxygen use in neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy [^047db60b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) typically presents in infancy with tachypnea, retractions, and hypoxemia. Some infants have failure to thrive, yet the frequency of this and other non-respiratory phenotypic features have not been delineated. While gradual improvement occurs, the clinical course is variable and the duration of supplemental oxygen requirement has not been defined.

Objectives

Our objective was to identify factors in NEHI that may drive differences in clinical course. We hypothesized that failure to thrive would be associated with greater duration of supplemental oxygen use.

Methods

Children with NEHI were identified as a nested retrospective cohort within an ongoing observational prospective study. An electronic questionnaire evaluating health status was distributed to the parents/guardians. Clinical data were obtained via chart review and parent interview.

Results

Of 42 children, 74% had a diagnosis of failure to thrive during their clinical course. Time to event analysis demonstrated that 50% discontinued daytime and nighttime oxygen at 32 and 87.5 months after initiation, respectively. Diagnosis of failure to thrive was associated with longer continuous oxygen supplementation, P = 0.03. Additional parental concerns identified through the electronic questionnaire included developmental delays, multiple hospitalizations, and delays in diagnosis.

Conclusions

NEHI is associated with substantial respiratory and extra-pulmonary morbidity. Failure to thrive may be associated with greater respiratory morbidity, though further studies are required to define this interaction. Determining the association of these comorbidities and respiratory course in NEHI may enable development of strategies to improve these modifiable factors and potentially pulmonary outcomes.

### Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015 [^c398cb13]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Insufficient growth during childhood is associated with poor health outcomes and an increased risk of death. Between 2000 and 2015, nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight, the core components of child growth failure. Here we show that striking subnational heterogeneity in levels and trends of child growth remains. If current rates of progress are sustained, many areas of Africa will meet the World Health Organization Global Targets 2025 to improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition, but high levels of growth failure will persist across the Sahel. At these rates, much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target-to end malnutrition by 2030. Geospatial estimates of child growth failure provide a baseline for measuring progress as well as a precision public health platform to target interventions to those populations with the greatest need, in order to reduce health disparities and accelerate progress.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^4820c0c8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) in infancy — genetic testing is described for suspected monogenic causes of chILD. Several single-gene disorders have been identified that can result in chILD syndrome, and patients are generally selected for genetic testing if the clinician recognizes clinical, radiographic, and/or histopathologic characteristics of a genetic disorder. Because phenotypes overlap, more than one gene is often analyzed, and gene prioritization depends on age of presentation, mode of inheritance, or extrapulmonary findings. In newborns with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension, etiologies include alveolar-capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD-MPV) and mutations in SFTPB, ABCA3, and possibly SFTPC, and ACD-MPV may include cardiac, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary malformations. Another phenotype with hypothyroidism and chorea may reflect loss-of-function mutations or deletions of NKX2.1, and in infants and young children, diffuse lung disease with failure to thrive and alveolar proteinosis may be due to loss-of-function mutations or deletions in CSF2RA and CSF2RB. Although genetic testing may be relatively expensive, it is rarely harmful and can provide a definitive diagnosis and obviate unnecessary procedures, but the sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing for chILD disorders has not been formally evaluated so false-positive and false-negative rates cannot be estimated; the committee assumed these rates are low.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy: a population-based prospective study [^def056de]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Background

During the first months of life, infants can suffer from many 'minor' gastroenterological disturbances. However, little is known about the frequency of these problems and the factors which predispose or facilitate their onset.

Aims

(a) To ascertain the frequency of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in infants during the first 6 months after birth; (b) to evaluate the influence of some variables on the onset of the symptoms.

Study Design and Patients

Each of the 150 paediatricians distributed throughout Italy followed 20 consecutive infants from birth to 6 months. 2879 infants (1422 f, 1457 m) concluded the study. The presence of the following symptoms was evaluated: constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting, regurgitation, failure to thrive and prolonged crying fits (colic). Symptoms were recorded whenever the parents requested a clinical check-up or during a set monthly examination.

Results

1582/2879 (54.9%) infants suffered from one of the gastrointestinal symptoms. Regurgitation was the most common disturbance (present in 23.1% of infants), followed by colic (20.5%), constipation (17.6%), failure to thrive (15.2%), vomiting (6%) and diarrhoea (4.1%). Low birth weight was the factor most frequently associated with the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by low gestational age. Feeding habits did not influence the onset of symptoms, with the exception of constipation, which was linked to a low frequency of breast-feeding. Ninety-three infants (3.2%) were hospitalised for one or more of the gastrointestinal symptoms which were considered. During the whole study period the type of formula-milk was changed in 60% of the infants with one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, and in 15.5% of the infants who did not suffer from any gastrointestinal troubles.

Conclusions

Gastrointestinal symptoms are very common in infants during the first 6 months after birth. These symptoms required hospitalisation only in a small percentage of cases, but led to the prescription of a 'dietary' milk formula in approximately 60% of the cases. Low birth weight and low gestational age were the main factors influencing the onset of the symptoms.

### The diagnostic accuracy of in-hospital weight gain for differentiating neglect from other failure to thrive etiologies [^e8d974d2]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the association of in-hospital weight gain with failure to thrive (FTT) etiologies.

Methods

With this retrospective cross-sectional study, we included children < 2 years of age hospitalized for FTT between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary care children's hospital. We excluded children with a gestational age < 37 weeks, intrauterine growth restriction, acute illness, or preexisting complex chronic conditions. Average daily in-hospital weight gain was categorized as (1) below average or (2) average or greater for age. χ², Fisher's exact test, and 1-way analysis of variance tests were used to compare patient demographics, therapies, and FTT etiologies with categorical weight gain; multivariable logistic regression models tested for associations.

Results

There were 331 children included. The primary etiologies of FTT were neglect (30.5%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (28.1%), child-centered feeding difficulties (22.4%), and organic pathology (19.0%). Average or greater weight gain for age had a specificity of 22.2% and positive predictive value of 33.9% for differentiating neglect from other FTT etiologies. However, sensitivity and negative predictive value were 91.1% and 85.0%, respectively. After adjusting for demographics and therapies received, neglect (P = 0.02) and child-centered feeding difficulties (P = 0.01) were more likely to have average or greater weight gain for age compared with organic pathology. Children with GERD gained similarly (P = 0.11) to children with organic pathology.

Conclusions

In-hospital weight gain was nonspecific for differentiating neglect from other FTT etiologies. Clinicians should exercise caution when using weight gain alone to confirm neglect. Conversely, below average weight gain may be more useful in supporting GERD or organic pathologies but cannot fully rule out neglect.

### Growth in children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during the first year of life [^eb9b7ecd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) have high rates of mortality and long-term morbidity, including poor growth and failure to thrive. The aim of this study was to describe growth patterns during the first year of life in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia in a non-ECMO cohort.

Methods

Medical records of infants with CDH admitted to our center between January 2005 and December 2011 were reviewed. Infants with anthropometric measurements at 3, 6 and 12months were included. Anthropometric measurements were obtained for the first year of life. Logistic regression analyses were performed to find predictive associations with failure to thrive (FTT).

Result

Of the 45 survivors, 38 were seen twice (84%) and 24 (53%) were seen on three occasions to age 12months. Poor growth was observed with weight being most affected. FTT was present in 63% during the first six months of life. Days of mechanical ventilation were the only predictor of FTT. Besides poor weight gain, height and head circumference were also reduced. However, catch-up growth occurred during the second half of infancy and at age 12months failure to thrive had reduced by two thirds to 21%.

Conclusions

Poor growth is a common early finding in CDH patients, which improves during infancy. This emphasizes the importance of close follow-up and aggressive nutritional management in CDH patients.

### Pediatric hospital admissions in indigenous children: a population-based study in remote Australia [^2a169841]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We analysed hospital admissions of a predominantly Aboriginal cohort of children in the remote Fitzroy Valley in Western Australia during the first 7 years of life.

Methods

All children born between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and living in the Fitzroy Valley in 2009–2010 were eligible to participate in the Lililwan Project. Of 134 eligible children, 127 (95%) completed Stage 1 (interviews of caregivers and medical record review) in 2011 and comprised our cohort. Lifetime (0–7 years) hospital admission data were available and included the dates, and reasons for admission, and comorbidities. Conditions were coded using ICD-10-AM discharge codes.

Results

Of the 127 children, 95.3% were Indigenous and 52.8% male. There were 314 admissions for 424 conditions in 89 (70.0%) of 127 children. The 89 children admitted had a median of five admissions (range 1–12). Hospitalization rates were similar for both genders (p = 0.4). Of the admissions, 108 (38.6%) were for 56 infants aged < 12 months (median = 2.5, range = 1–8). Twelve of these admissions were in neonates (aged 0–28 days).

Primary reasons for admission (0–7 years) were infections of the lower respiratory tract (27.4%), gastrointestinal system (22.7%), and upper respiratory tract (11.4%), injury (7.0%), and failure to thrive (5.4%). Comorbidities, particularly upper respiratory tract infections (18.1%), failure to thrive (13.6%), and anaemia (12.7%), were common.

In infancy, primary cause for admission were infections of the lower respiratory tract (40.8%), gastrointestinal (25.9%) and upper respiratory tract (9.3%). Comorbidities included upper respiratory tract infections (33.3%), failure to thrive (18.5%) and anaemia (18.5%).

Conclusion

In the Fitzroy Valley 70.0% of children were hospitalised at least once before age 7 years and over one third of admissions were in infants. Infections were the most common reason for admission in all age groups but comorbidities were common and may contribute to need for admission. Many hospitalizations were feasibly preventable. High admission rates reflect disadvantage, remote location and limited access to primary healthcare and outpatient services. Ongoing public health prevention initiatives including breast feeding, vaccination, healthy diet, hygiene and housing improvements are crucial, as is training of Aboriginal Health Workers to increase services in remote communities.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^adf9f927]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Late preterm and early term infants — risk profile and monitoring — Close observation and monitoring are required, especially in the first 12–24 hours after birth when the risk of inadequate adaptation to extra-uterine life is the highest. Late preterm infants born at 34 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks of gestation have a 50% risk for morbidity during the birth hospitalization, and early term infants, born between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks of gestation, are also at higher risk compared with term infants, born between 39 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation, for problems including hyperbilirubinemia, hospital readmission, and reduced breastfeeding initiation and duration. Morbidities in late preterm infants include hypothermia, hypoglycemia, excessive weight loss, dehydration, slow weight gain, failure to thrive, prolonged infant formula supplementation, exaggerated jaundice, kernicterus, dehydration, fever secondary to dehydration, sepsis, apnea, re-hospitalization, and breastfeeding failure, and transfer to a higher level of care for appropriate care and monitoring may be needed.

### Geriatric failure to thrive [^01b4ca53]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

In elderly patients, failure to thrive describes a state of decline that is multifactorial and may be caused by chronic concurrent diseases and functional impairments. Manifestations of this condition include weight loss, decreased appetite, poor nutrition, and inactivity. Four syndromes are prevalent and predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with failure to thrive: impaired physical function, malnutrition, depression, and cognitive impairment. Initial assessments should include information on physical and psychologic health, functional ability, socioenvironmental factors, and nutrition. Laboratory and radiologic evaluations initially are limited to a complete blood count, chemistry panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, urinalysis, and other studies that are appropriate for an individual patient. A medication review should ensure that side effects or drug interactions are not a contributing factor to failure to thrive. The impact of existing chronic diseases should be assessed. Interventions should be directed toward easily treatable causes of failure to thrive, with the goal of maintaining or improving overall functional status. Physicians should recognize the diagnosis of failure to thrive as a key decision point in the care of an elderly person. The diagnosis should prompt discussion of end-of-life care options to prevent needless interventions that may prolong suffering.

### A picture is worth a thousand words [^a58b1358]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of weight faltering can be challenging and often controversial. The determination should be made based on careful evaluation of growth parameters, including longitudinal patterns plotted on age- and gender-appropriate growth charts. For children with suspected or diagnosed weight faltering, the initial work-up should be limited, with laboratory tests and studies directed by findings on history and physical examination. Treatment should include nutritional counselling, familial support, and close outpatient follow-up. Hospitalisation may be useful in some cases but should not be used routinely to assist in the diagnostic work-up. Patients with limited response to these interventions may require further evaluation.

### Cystic fibrosis in three children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^d7ce39e1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are two common causes of chronic lung disease in children. Patients with BPD or CF often have recurrent respiratory symptoms, failure to thrive, and/or metabolic alkalosis during infancy and childhood. Thus, recognizing the diagnosis of CF in an infant with BPD can be difficult. We present three infants with both BPD and CF. The infants shared a history of respiratory distress and prolonged oxygen requirements. All three also had difficulty gaining weight, even after pancreatic enzyme supplementation was instituted. Metabolic alkalosis was observed in two infants. Previous studies in children with CF suggest that early diagnosis may impact both lung health and nutritional status. A high index of suspicion is necessary for clinicians to identify these children early and intervene with appropriate therapy.

### Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis presenting as anemia, failure to thrive, and jaundice in a toddler [^adade3b5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease characterized by the triad of hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, and anemia. Its diagnosis should be considered in any child presenting with moderate to severe anemia and failure to thrive of unclear etiology. Consideration of the differential diagnosis in such a child should include the review of both extravascular and intravascular causes of hemolysis. Systemic treatment of IPH with glucocorticoids has been shown to decrease morbidity, mortality, and disease progression to pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, diagnostic delays can impact prognosis. Here, we present a case of a 15-month-old boy with IPH who presented with anemia, jaundice, and failure to thrive, as well as a history of hemoptysis that was not initially elicited.

### Inflammatory bowel disease in children 5 years of age and younger [^16571b8b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can affect all age groups, although it has not been well described in infants and young children. Our aim was to evaluate early onset IBD in patients 5 yr of age and younger.

Methods

Medical records of patients diagnosed with early onset IBD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1977 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three categories: those with Crohn's disease (CD), those with ulcerative colitis (UC), and those with indeterminant colitis (IC).

Results

A total of 82 patients fulfilled the criteria. In 12 patients (15%), the IBD diagnosis was changed during the course of illness. At the end of the follow-up period, linear growth failure was present in 10 of 35 (29%) children with CD, one of 30 (3%) with UC, and three of 17 (18%) with IC. Failure to thrive was a frequent presenting symptom in children with CD (44%) and IC (39%), whereas in all four patients with UC and failure to thrive the diagnosis was subsequently changed to CD or IC. A high proportion of patients with CD had large bowel (89%), and perianal (34%) disease. None of the tested patients were positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), and 10 tested positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (three of five patients with CD, five of seven with UC, and two of three with IC).

Conclusions

Failure to thrive, at the time of presentation, is indicative of a final diagnosis of CD or IC, not UC. Linear growth failure is a common finding in patients with early onset CD. A high proportion of patients with CD have failure to thrive, colonic, and perianal disease. The IBD serology panel is of limited clinical relevance in providing definitive diagnostic information in this pediatric population.

### Sanjad-sakati syndrome with macrocytic anemia and failure to thrive: a case from south Jordan [^35a9b748]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Backgorund: Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (SSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a deletion mutation (155-166del) in exon 3 of the TBCE gene on chromosome 1q42-43. The syndrome is characterized by primary hypoparathyroidism, typical dysmorphic features and severe growth retardation.

Case Presentation

We encountered a 2-year-old boy with hypocalcemia, failure to thrive and macrocytic anemia. The patient had the characteristic features of SSS and genetic testing confirmed that he was homozygous for the TBCE mutation. Although malabsorption was initially considered the cause of his symptoms, the results did not confirm that diagnosis. Our patient had cow milk protein allergy and folic acid deficiency, which has not been described in previous SSS cases. It was difficult to treat the patient's hyperphosphatemia and we ultimately selected sevelamer treatment, which was tolerated well and improved his hypocalcemia.

Conclusions

SSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypocalcemia, dysmorphism and failure to thrive.

### ASPEN definitions in pediatric intestinal failure [^59aed827]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Aspen Pediatric Intestinal Failure (PIF) Section — pediatric intestinal failure is a relatively rare disease requiring focused interdisciplinary care and specialized nutrition management; because there has long been a lack of consensus in the definition of key terms related to PIF, this document is the product of an effort by the Section to create evidence-based consensus definitions with the goal of allowing appropriate comparisons between clinical studies and measurement of long-term patient outcomes; the paper has been approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors, and the definitions should have direct relevance to the daily management of children with intestinal failure by allowing providers across disciplines and centers to speak a common language.

### The diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): the primary immune deficiency treatment consortium (PIDTC) 2022 definitions [^08157004]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) was established to investigate natural history and outcomes for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other rare primary immune deficiencies by means of prospective and retrospective natural history studies. Criteria for the diagnosis of SCID, using tests commonly applied at participating centers, were developed for PIDTC protocols beginning in 2010. The early diagnostic experience, codified by Dr William Shearer and collaborators in the PIDTC 2014 Criteria, proposed definitions for typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome, with the goal of facilitating a rigorous analysis of consistent subtypes of SCID, independent of clinical factors such as infections or failure to thrive. These definitions, based on review of the 332 patients with SCID enrolled in the retrospective PIDTC Protocol 6902, between 2000 and 2009, mainly considered T-cell numbers, naive versus memory T cells, T-cell proliferative responses to PHA, and transplacentally acquired maternal engraftment (TME) of T cells.

Between 2014 and 2021, both clinical presentation and diagnosis of SCID have changed with widespread adoption of newborn screening (NBS) and improved availability of gene sequencing. – Current enrollment into the PIDTC Protocols for SCID has made possible analyses showing that the 2014 Criteria should now be refined to incorporate these and other contemporary advances. Universal NBS for SCID by enumerating T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spots collected at birth has radically altered how infants with SCID in the United States and most infants in Canada are now identified. NBS has also brought to attention a new category of patients: very young infants (typically aged < 30 days) with low TRECs and T-cell lymphopenia in whom SCID is suspected, but not yet confirmed. Simultaneously, genetic sequencing has become faster, cheaper, and widely available, and so causative pathogenic gene variants are identified in more than 90% of patients with SCID.

### Guidance on forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment [^2f65a617]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal prognosis in severe conditions — For some newborn infants who were born at extremely low gestational age (< 25 weeks), survived profound asphyxia, possess certain life-threatening congenital anomalies, or have multiple organ system failure, the AAP recognizes that "prognosis is uncertain but likely to be very poor", and survival may be accompanied by a high risk of "permanent, severe neurodevelopmental and other special health care needs" and diminished quality of life.
