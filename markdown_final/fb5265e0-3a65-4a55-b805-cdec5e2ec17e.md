## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pulmonary adenocarcinoma, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and baseline prognosis to frame the clinical context. Then, I should verify the current WHO/IASLC histologic classification and grading and how it impacts prognosis. Next, I will review molecular testing requirements and the role of PD-L1/TMB. After that, I need to stage the disease and map stage-specific treatment strategies, including surgery, chemoradiation, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. I will then examine special scenarios like subsolid nodules, multifocal disease, and transplant candidacy. Finally, I should consider emerging biomarkers, resistance mechanisms, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with multidisciplinary care principles.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and baseline prognosis so I don't jump to conclusions. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, comprising roughly 35–40% of cases, and NSCLC overall accounts for about 85% of lung cancers, which aligns with contemporary summaries and NCI data, though I should note that exact percentages vary by cohort and region [^111aEtRk] [^116xq5tE]. Hold on, I should verify the survival figures; advanced-stage disease carries a 5-year survival around 10–20%, and overall lung cancer 5-year survival remains low, reflecting late-stage presentation and persistent mortality, so any management plan must prioritize timely staging and molecular profiling to access targeted options that improve outcomes [^111BbP3E] [^114AEFSp].

> Next, I should review the histologic classification and grading because it directly informs prognosis and, increasingly, surgical planning. The 2021 WHO framework operationalizes the IASLC/ATS/ERS schema, replacing "bronchioloalveolar carcinoma" with adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and classifying invasive adenocarcinomas by predominant pattern: lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and solid, with variants such as invasive mucinous, colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma, which I need to keep in mind for both resection and biopsy reporting [^112cxxmh] [^112FC2bY]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic gradient: lepidic predominance correlates with better outcomes, whereas solid and micropapillary patterns portend worse prognosis; the newer IASLC grading system further stratifies invasive nonmucinous adenocarcinoma into three tiers based on composite histologic patterns, improving prognostic discrimination beyond a single predominant pattern, which is clinically relevant for adjuvant decisions and surveillance intensity [^111aEtRk] [^113h7hZU].

> I will now examine molecular testing because adenocarcinoma is the NSCLC subtype in which most actionable drivers reside. I should confirm that EGFR and ALK are "must-test" biomarkers in advanced adenocarcinoma, and that ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, ERBB2, and KRAS are included in broad panels; importantly, EGFR T790M testing is mandatory after progression on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs to select third-generation therapy, and assays should detect T790M down to about 5% variant allele frequency to avoid false negatives [^111pbDwx] [^111VDca1] [^117ET2ge] [^114D4oqK]. Hold on, I should verify testing in nonadenocarcinoma histologies; guidelines endorse molecular testing in nonsquamous NSCLC and in select squamous cases with clinical features suggesting drivers, but routine testing in typical squamous histology lacks sufficient evidence, so I need to be judicious and context-driven [^11136EAZ] [^116X8cxX].

> Next, I should review PD-L1 and TMB because they influence immunotherapy selection. PD-L1 IHC using validated assays is recommended to be performed routinely in advanced NSCLC, with results integrated alongside genomic biomarkers to guide immune checkpoint inhibitor use; TMB can be considered but remains investigational in many settings, so I should not overinterpret TMB outside trials or specific indications [^113WbpsF]. Wait, let me double-check that PD-L1 testing is prioritized across stages where immunotherapy is contemplated; yes, consensus statements and pathology guidelines consistently support PD-L1 as part of the initial workup in advanced disease [^113WbpsF].

> Now, staging and initial workup. I need to ensure TNM 8th edition is used, with attention to invasive size for part-solid lesions and careful nodal assessment; for early-stage disease, systematic mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection from at least three named stations is required for accurate staging and to guide adjuvant therapy decisions, and I should confirm this with surgical standards and NCCN imaging guidance [^111GLYZb] [^116xq5tE] [^112FC2bY]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PET-CT and brain MRI; PET-CT is standard for metabolic staging and brain MRI is recommended in many guidelines for advanced disease or when symptoms suggest CNS involvement, so I will incorporate these based on stage and clinical suspicion [^113vhULV].

> For stage I–II disease, I should confirm that surgical resection remains the cornerstone. Lobectomy with systematic nodal assessment is preferred for most patients, while sublobar resection is reasonable for small (≤ 2 cm), peripheral, non–high-grade tumors, with emerging evidence supporting segmentectomy equivalence in select T1a settings; minimally invasive approaches are preferred when feasible, and adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for resected stage II disease, with adjuvant targeted therapy improving survival in resected EGFR-mutant stage IB–II disease, which I need to remember to order up front [^111Fa2vS] [^116DwD9U] [^114mfVTW]. Wait, I almost said SBRT is an alternative for all stage I patients; I should correct that — SBRT is the preferred nonoperative option for medically inoperable patients or those who decline surgery, not a blanket substitute for resection in operable candidates [^111Fa2vS].

> For stage III disease, I need to check the standard of care. Concurrent chemoradiation followed by durvalumab consolidation is the evidence-based backbone for unresectable stage III NSCLC, and decisions about surgical resection after induction chemoradiation should be made upfront by a multidisciplinary team because pretreatment characteristics cannot reliably predict benefit; I should also consider that some data suggest T4N2M0 adenocarcinoma behaves more like IIIC and may warrant more aggressive strategies, though this is hypothesis-generating and requires multidisciplinary adjudication [^1173XVQf] [^112gcfWF]. But wait, what if the patient is borderline resectable? In that case, induction therapy followed by reassessment and surgery in experienced centers is reasonable, with explicit acknowledgment of the risks and uncertainties [^1173XVQf].

> For stage IV disease, I should confirm that first-line therapy is dictated by molecular status. EGFR-, ALK-, ROS1-, BRAF-, MET-, RET-, or ERBB2-altered adenocarcinomas should receive the corresponding targeted therapy, which yields superior response and survival compared with chemotherapy; for driver-negative or PD-L1–high tumors, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy are appropriate, and I need to ensure PD-L1 is available before committing to IO monotherapy [^111pbDwx] [^113vhULV] [^113WbpsF]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of ROS1 recommendations; multiple CAP/IASLC/AMP documents issue a strong recommendation for ROS1 testing in advanced adenocarcinoma, supporting routine inclusion in panels and reflex strategies [^114jUfnG] [^113JEMG9].

> I will now examine special scenarios that alter management. For subsolid nodules, I should confirm that size and solid component drive malignancy risk and extent of resection; for ≤ 2 cm, sublobar resection can be considered, whereas ≥ 2 cm or higher-grade patterns favor lobectomy, and preoperative recognition of micropapillary or solid components may push toward anatomic resection and more extensive nodal evaluation [^116DwD9U] [^113KvGH6]. For multifocal lung adenocarcinoma arising from GGOs, I need to ensure we avoid overtreatment of indolent disease while still addressing dominant invasive foci; this requires careful radiologic-pathologic correlation and longitudinal surveillance planning [^115exGVp]. For patients with severe respiratory failure, ECMO can serve as a bridge to diagnosis and targeted therapy in select cases, but I should confirm candidacy carefully and anticipate infection and bleeding risks [^114Unqtd] [^115S2kwE]. Finally, lung transplantation is reserved for highly selected patients with lung-limited AIS, MIA, or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma in whom resection is not feasible and transplant is expected to be curative, which is a niche but important pathway [^1117iLnH] [^115T4J24].

> Next, I should review emerging biomarkers and resistance mechanisms to anticipate future practice shifts. Transcriptional subtypes such as mucinous, proliferative, and mesenchymal capture heterogeneity and may predict differential responses to pathway inhibitors like MEK, while proteogenomic and multiomic profiling reveal immune and stromal features that could refine immunotherapy selection beyond PD-L1; I need to keep an eye on these data as they mature [^1174MNwL] [^114VZSek]. For KRAS-mutant adenocarcinoma, I should confirm that alveolar differentiation and AT1-like states contribute to intrinsic and acquired resistance, suggesting combination strategies that target differentiation programs alongside KRAS inhibition, which is an active translational frontier [^111jBbS6].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I will double-check each branch against guidelines. First, confirm histology and perform comprehensive molecular testing on any advanced adenocarcinoma or nonsquamous NSCLC, including EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, ERBB2, and KRAS, with reflex PD-L1 and consideration of TMB; if tissue is insufficient, use plasma cfDNA to "rule in" drivers, and if resistance emerges on EGFR TKI, test for T790M with sensitive assays to guide third-generation therapy [^111pbDwx] [^111VDca1] [^114yvAos] [^113WbpsF] [^117ET2ge]. Second, stage rigorously with CT, PET-CT, and brain MRI as indicated, ensuring nodal assessment meets surgical standards if operative, and then align therapy to stage and drivers: resection for early stage with adjuvant therapy per risk and mutation status, chemoradiation plus consolidation IO for unresectable stage III, and targeted therapy or IO-based regimens for stage IV based on molecular and PD-L1 results, all within a multidisciplinary framework that revisits decisions at key inflection points [^111GLYZb] [^113vhULV] [^1173XVQf].

> Finally, I need to ensure multidisciplinary care and quality metrics are embedded throughout. Best outcomes occur when thoracic surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists coordinate care, document nodal assessments, and track performance; I should confirm that nodal evaluation from at least three stations is standard in resection reports and that molecular turnaround times are minimized to avoid delaying targeted therapy starts, as delays can impact survival in advanced disease [^111GLYZb] [^114ubQ8M]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with major guidelines; the NCCN, CAP/IASLC/AMP, and CHEST/ACCP recommendations converge on these principles, supporting the algorithm's applicability across practice settings [^115EkxNi] [^111pbDwx] [^111Fa2vS].

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the **most common NSCLC subtype** [^111aEtRk], comprising ~40% of lung cancers and rising in incidence, especially among never-smokers and women [^114VAUTG]. It arises from type II pneumocytes and Clara cells, often presenting as peripheral, subsolid nodules with lepidic growth [^112FC2bY]. Diagnosis relies on **histopathology and immunohistochemistry** (TTF-1, Napsin A) [^112cxxmh], with molecular profiling for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, MET, RET, and HER2 to guide targeted therapy [^115YR3na]. Prognosis varies by stage and histologic pattern, with solid and micropapillary patterns portending worse outcomes [^111aEtRk]. Early-stage disease is managed with surgery; advanced disease uses targeted therapy or immunotherapy, with 5-year survival ~90% for stage I but < 5% for stage IV [^111Fa2vS] [^113vhULV] [^116DwD9U].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the **most common NSCLC subtype** [^111aEtRk], accounting for ~40% of lung cancers and increasing in incidence, particularly among never-smokers and women [^114VAUTG]. Major risk factors include smoking, environmental exposures (radon, asbestos, air pollution), and genetic predisposition; notably, **never-smokers comprise a significant proportion** of cases, especially in East Asian populations [^116XJkhR].

---

## Histopathological features

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma exhibits diverse histological patterns, each with distinct clinical implications [^112cxxmh]:

| **Histological pattern** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Lepidic | - Indolent <br/> - Better prognosis |
| Acinar | Intermediate prognosis |
| Papillary | Intermediate prognosis |
| Micropapillary | - Aggressive <br/> - Poor prognosis |
| Solid | - Aggressive <br/> - Poor prognosis |

---

The **2021 WHO classification** [^112cxxmh] emphasizes comprehensive histologic subtyping and grading based on predominant patterns, correlating with prognosis and guiding therapy.

---

## Molecular and genetic alterations

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is characterized by **distinct molecular alterations**, many of which are therapeutically actionable [^1117DpqB]:

- **EGFR mutations**: Common in never-smokers; targeted by EGFR TKIs (e.g. osimertinib) [^111VDca1].
- **ALK rearrangements**: Treated with ALK inhibitors (e.g. alectinib, lorlatinib) [^111VDca1].
- **ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, MET, RET, HER2**: Additional actionable targets with specific inhibitors [^114yvAos].
- **Tumor suppressor genes**: TP53, STK11, KEAP1 frequently mutated, influencing prognosis and therapy response [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients typically present with persistent cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, or incidental radiographic findings. Diagnosis involves **imaging (CT, PET-CT)** [^113vhULV], **histopathology**, and **immunohistochemistry** (TTF-1, Napsin A) [^notfound]. Molecular testing is essential to identify actionable mutations and guide targeted therapy [^111pbDwx].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on **stage**, **histology**, and **molecular profile**:

- **Early-stage (I-II)**: Surgical resection is the primary treatment; minimally invasive approaches are preferred [^111Fa2vS].
- **Locally advanced (III)**: Chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy (durvalumab) is standard [^113vhULV].
- **Advanced/metastatic (IV)**: Targeted therapy for actionable mutations; immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) for PD-L1-positive or negative cases without actionable mutations [^113oUaiX] [^113vhULV].

---

## Prognosis and survival

Prognosis varies significantly by stage and histologic pattern. Early-stage disease has a 5-year survival rate of ~90%, whereas advanced disease has a 5-year survival rate of **< 5%**. Solid and micropapillary patterns are associated with **poorer outcomes** [^111aEtRk].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent advances include the development of **third-generation EGFR inhibitors** (e.g. osimertinib), **KRAS G12C inhibitors** (e.g. sotorasib), and novel immunotherapy combinations [^111jBbS6]. Liquid biopsy and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are emerging tools for **non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring** [^112ZsupL].

---

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a **heterogeneous NSCLC subtype** with distinct clinical, histological, and molecular features. Advances in molecular profiling and targeted therapies have significantly improved outcomes, particularly in early-stage disease [^111Fa2vS].

### Pulmonary adenocarcinoma updates: histology, cytology, and grading [^112cxxmh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Adenocarcinomas are the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, and exist within a widely divergent clinical, radiologic, molecular, and histologic spectrum. There is a strong association between histologic patterns and prognosis that served as the basis for a recently described grading system. As the study of molecular pathology rapidly evolves, all targetable mutations so far have been found in adenocarcinomas, thus requiring accurate diagnosis and classification for the triage of molecular alterations and adequate therapy.

Objective —

To discuss the rationale for adenocarcinoma classifications within the 2021 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification, with a focus on nonmucinous tumors, including tumor grading and biopsy/cytology diagnosis.

Data Sources —

PubMed search.

Conclusions —

A grading system for adenocarcinoma has improved prognostic impact of the classification of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. An accurate diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in small biopsy material is important for tissue triage for molecular studies and ultimately for patient management and treatment.

### A proposal to modify the 8th IASLC system: is it suitable for T4N2M0 lung adenocarcinoma to be placed in stage IIIB? [^112gcfWF]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with stage T4N2M0 have a worse survival prognosis than stage IIIB patients. In contrast, it has a similar survival prognosis compared with stage IIIC patients. Finally, we suggest that lung adenocarcinoma patients with stage T4N2M0 should be upstaged and accept more aggressive treatments.

We discuss the optimal timing of surgery for lung cancer, and propose 3 surgical strategies for pre- and minimally invasive lung adenocarcinoma to avoid "overdiagnosis" and "overtreatment". Benign disease should not be treated as malignancy, pre- and minimally invasive disease should not be treated as invasive disease, and indolent malignancy should not be treated as aggressive malignancy.

First-line therapy with gefitinib prolongs progression-free survival and improves quality of life among selected patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Selected locally advanced patients may derive benefit from surgical resection after gefitinib therapy. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of gefitinib therapy followed by surgical resection.

### Clinical relevance of the new IASLC / ERS / ATS adenocarcinoma classification [^112uvtZr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

In 2011, recommendations for a multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma were published under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society. The review was considered necessary due to emerging data on the radiological features, genetics and therapeutic approaches to lung adenocarcinoma, all underpinned by expanding the knowledge of the pathology of this common tumour. The existing WHO classification of 2004 was not really fit for this multidisciplinary focus on the disease. This review describes the recommendations made on the reporting of surgically resected lung cancers according to their predominant pattern, and argues the case for replacing the term bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (WHO 1999 and 2004 definition) with adenocarcinoma in situ and for the introduction of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. There is also a discussion of diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas in the small biopsy or cytology setting, a practice that was inadequately addressed in WHO 2004, yet this is much more relevant to most pathologists' daily practice because 85% or so of adenocarcinomas are never resected. Predictive immunohistochemistry, used correctly, can reduce non-specific diagnosis to less than 10% of the cases. Finally, there is an overview of the emerging data on therapeutically relevant lung adenocarcinoma genetics, considering targetable mutations that are now the focus of much activity. The clinical relevance of these changes is discussed.

### Updated molecular testing guideline for the selection of lung cancer patients for treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors: guideline from the college of American pathologists, the international association for the study of lung cancer, and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^111pbDwx]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2018). Medium credibility.

CAP-IASLC-AMP molecular testing guideline — objective and key questions: The expert panel was charged with the review and update of the CAP-IASLC-AMP molecular testing guideline for selection of lung cancer patients for EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and the panel reviewed any new studies that would change or refute the statements from the 2013 guideline. The panel also addressed additional key questions, including which new genes should be tested in lung adenocarcinoma patients, what methods should be used to perform molecular testing, whether molecular testing is appropriate for lung cancers that do not have an adenocarcinoma component, what testing is indicated for patients with targetable mutations who have relapsed on targeted therapy, and what is the role of testing for circulating cell-free DNA for lung cancer patients. Key questions 1 through 3 relate to patients diagnosed with nonsquamous non — small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of all stages.

### Classification of lung cancer: proposals for change? [^114WzrgD]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical need and developments in pathology and molecular biology require our cancer classifications to be constantly updated to keep them relevant and useful. A review of lung cancer classification is due and has been initiated with new proposals on classification of lung adenocarcinoma. Other major lung cancer types also deserve a similar consideration. As well as addressing the categories of tumor, as signed out in surgical resection specimens, recent proposals on small diagnostic-sample reporting would be an important addition to any new classification. The huge increase in data on the molecular biology of lung cancer has improved our understanding of these diseases, has driven improved therapy for some patients, and must be reflected in the way lung cancer is classified.

### Erlotinib salvage therapy in pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with disease progression after previous EGFR-TKI treatment [^117SHaX1]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with promising efficacy in treating pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Treatment choices are few when patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma have failed both EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of erlotinib as salvage treatment for these nonresponsive patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the chart records of our stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients who were diagnosed and treated between July 2004 and June 2013. Clinical data, including type of response to treatment, time to disease progression, duration between the end of first-line EGFR-TKI treatment and starting erlotinib treatment, and overall survival time, were collected.

Results

A total of 98 patients were enrolled, and all had been treated with EGFR-TKI, either as a first-line therapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy; of them, 60 patients had a response to initial EGFR-TKI treatment. All received erlotinib as salvage treatment after their disease had progressed following EGFR-TKI treatment. Ninety-three (93.3%) patients had also received previous platinum-based chemotherapy. The median progression-free survival with erlotinib as salvage treatment for patients with and without a response to front-line EGFR-TKI was 4.9 and 3.4 months (P = 0.869), respectively. The progression-free survival with erlotinib treatment in the sensitizing EGFR mutation group was 4.3 months, and in the EGFR wild-type group it was 2.6 months (P = 0.22).

Conclusions

In pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients who had been heavily treated, erlotinib could still be a choice, regardless of the EGFR mutation status, or whether the patients had responded to previous EGFR-TKI treatment.

### Lessons learned from lung cancer genomics: the emerging concept of individualized diagnostics and treatment [^114sZ2TQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The advent of novel therapeutics that specifically target signaling pathways activated by genetic alterations has revolutionized the way patients with lung cancer are treated. Although only few and largely ineffective chemotherapeutic regimens were available 10 years ago, a lung tumor diagnosed today requires extensive pathologic subtyping and diagnosis of genome alterations to afford more effective treatment (eg, in EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma). This change of paradigm has several profound implications, ranging from preclinical work on the mechanism of action to a novel, more biologically oriented taxonomy and from genome diagnostics to trial design. Here, we have summarized these developments into six conceptual paradigms that illustrate the transition from empirical cancer medicine to mechanistically based individualized oncology.

### Advancements in diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients under ECMO support: a case series and comprehensive literature review [^114Unqtd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This case series highlights the potential role of VV ECMO as a bridge to diagnosis and targeted therapy in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma and severe respiratory failure. Our findings suggest that ECMO can help preserve organ function and should not be considered an absolute contraindication in advanced lung cancer, particularly in patients with actionable mutations. Liquid biopsy using BALF provides a non-invasive diagnostic tool, while lung biopsy remains safe and facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment. ECMO support should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with careful patient selection to optimize outcomes and avoid futile interventions. Further studies are needed to establish clear criteria for ECMO use in this population.

### Clinicopathological predictors of survival in resected primary lung adenocarcinoma [^111aEtRk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with adenocarcinoma being the most common histological subtype accounting for 35% of lung cancers. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is heterogeneous in its histological pattern, molecular profile, clinical findings, radiological presentation and treatment options.

In 2015, a new WHO Classification of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (fourth edition) was published defining five different histological subtypes: lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary and solid patterns. This new classification for adenocarcinomas was based on the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) recommendations made in 2011.

Since 2011, several publications have reported a strong correlation between predominant patterns of adenocarcinoma and prognosis, with solid and micropapillary patterns conferring a worse prognosis (reduced overall survival (OS)) and lepidic predominance having a better prognosis. Despite this, tumour subtype is currently not a criterion used to select patients for adjuvant therapies.

More recently, tumour intra-alveolar spread has been shown to strongly correlate with lymph node and distant metastases as well as a higher incidence of local recurrence of tumour, hence serving as an independent negative prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinomas.

The main aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of adenocarcinoma subtype and intra-alveolar spread on survival after anatomical lung resection and to identify different prognostic factors based on stage and histological subtypes.

### International association for the study of lung cancer / American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma [^112FC2bY]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. To address advances in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, radiology, and surgery of lung adenocarcinoma, an international multidisciplinary classification was sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society. This new adenocarcinoma classification is needed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), the overall approach to small nonresection cancer specimens, and for multidisciplinary strategic management of tissue for molecular and immunohistochemical studies.

Methods

An international core panel of experts representing all three societies was formed with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. A systematic review was performed under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society Documents Development and Implementation Committee. The search strategy identified 11,368 citations of which 312 articles met specified eligibility criteria and were retrieved for full text review. A series of meetings were held to discuss the development of the new classification, to develop the recommendations, and to write the current document. Recommendations for key questions were graded by strength and quality of the evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

The classification addresses both resection specimens, and small biopsies and cytology. The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion (MIA) to define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100% or near 100% disease-specific survival, respectively. AIS and MIA are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. This classification provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, as approximately 70% of lung cancers are diagnosed in such samples. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), in patients with advanced-stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy compared with squamous cell carcinoma, and (3) potential life-threatening hemorrhage may occur in patients with squamous cell carcinoma who receive bevacizumab. If the tumor cannot be classified based on light microscopy alone, special studies such as immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains should be applied to classify the tumor further. Use of the term NSCLC not otherwise specified should be minimized.

Conclusions

This new classification strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that incorporates clinical, molecular, radiologic, and surgical issues, but it is primarily based on histology. This classification is intended to support clinical practice, and research investigation and clinical trials. As EGFR mutation is a validated predictive marker for response and progression-free survival with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, we recommend that patients with advanced adenocarcinomas be tested for EGFR mutation. This has implications for strategic management of tissue, particularly for small biopsies and cytology samples, to maximize high-quality tissue available for molecular studies. Potential impact for tumor, node, and metastasis staging include adjustment of the size T factor according to only the invasive component (1) pathologically in invasive tumors with lepidic areas or (2) radiologically by measuring the solid component of part-solid nodules.

### Genomic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma [^1117DpqB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer is evolving from the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy to personalised treatment based on molecular alterations. This past decade has witnessed substantial progress in the treatment of patients with EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements, and it is now possible to study complex genomic alterations in cancer using next-generation sequencing. Sequencing data from large-scale consortia, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as several independent groups, have helped identify novel drivers and potentially targetable alterations in lung adenocarcinomas. These data clearly suggest that lung adenocarcinoma is associated with distinct genomic alterations compared with other lung cancer subtypes, and highlight the widespread molecular heterogeneity that underlies the disease. In this Review, we discuss some of the key findings from genomic studies of lung adenocarcinoma.

### Global prognostic impact of driver genetic alterations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma: a real-life study [^114AEFSp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is currently one of the most incident and lethal malignancies; in accordance with data from the Global Cancer Observatory, in 2020 were estimated more than 2.2 million new cases and approximately 1.8 million deaths worldwide, and a continuously increasing trend for both the incidence and mortality rates is expected for the next 20 years. The narrowness in the gap between incidence and mortality rates, witnesses the difficulties in the clinical management of patients with lung cancer, especially those diagnosed with advanced stage disease, and the persistence of high mortality rates in this subset of patients. It is currently estimated that less than 21% of lung cancer patients are alive after five years from diagnosis, and this depends on several factors, such as the silent clinical course of the disease that leads to a late diagnosis in most cases, advanced age, impaired lung function related with tobacco smoking, cardiovascular and other comorbidities, histological subtype of the disease, and others. Significant improvements in lung cancer survival have been obtained in the last decade with the introduction of two novel therapeutic approaches for patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a group of histological subtypes that includes approximately 85% of lung cancers: immunotherapy and gene targeted therapy.

Biomarker category framework — the guideline stratifies biomarkers into 3 categories, rather than 2: "must-test" biomarkers that are standard of care for all patients with advanced lung cancer with an adenocarcinoma component who are being considered for an approved targeted therapy; "should-test" biomarkers used to direct patients to clinical trials and included in any large sequencing panel but not required for laboratories that perform only single-gene assays; and all remaining candidate biomarkers are investigational and are not appropriate for clinical use at this time.

Introduction

The American Thoracic Society is a cosponsor of a newly published lung adenocarcinoma classification.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary panel of experts was formed. A systematic review was performed and recommendations were graded by strength and quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

The classification addresses both resection specimens and small biopsies/cytology. The terms bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma for small solitary adenocarcinomas with pure lepidic growth and predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion, respectively. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic, acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added. In the new aspect of this classification that provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), in patients with advanced stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types, such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible, for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for EGFR mutations, because the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy, and (3) squamous histology is a risk factor for life-threatening hemorrhage with bevacizumab therapy. NSCLC- not otherwise specified by light microscopy alone should be studied with immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains.

Conclusions

This classification is intended to support clinical practice as well as research investigation and clinical trials.

Consensus recommendations

Clinical question 1: What is the appropriate use of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with NSCLC?

Over half of patients newly diagnosed in the U.S. with NSCLC present with advanced disease that has already metastasized. At this stage, there have historically been no curative treatment options and few patients (< 5%) survived five or more years. However, there are several treatment options available that can prolong survival in patients with metastatic disease. The Task Force considered the following immunotherapy options for patients with advanced disease: pembrolizumab as a single agent in the first-line setting; nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab in the second-line setting; pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in the first-line setting; and durvalumab in the maintenance/adjuvant setting. Additionally, the Task Force considered durvalumab following chemoradiation in patients with locally, advanced disease.

Initial assessment

In order to determine eligibility for these agents, patients with advanced NSCLC should undergo a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including a complete review of clinical, radiological, and pathological information. This workup should include determination of tumor histological subtype, and molecular analysis to identify targetable driver mutations. The Task Force was in agreement that the analysis of PD-L1 expression by an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based test to determine PD-L1 expression levels should be routine for all patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC. Prior to initiation of immunotherapy, tests recommended by the majority of the Task Force included computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (88% recommended) and thyroid function tests (81%).

The Task Force did not reach a majority in recommending tests including creatinine clearance (50%); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (50%); and pulmonary function tests (50%). Of note, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of NSCLC agree with the Task Force recommendation for CT scans of all patients, but differ by recommending brain MRI across all disease stages. NCCN only recommends pulmonary function tests in specific cases and if surgery is an option.

### Which patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer should undergo surgical resection? [^114NXb56]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC remains controversial. Stage III NSCLC comprises a fairly heterogeneous group of tumors, and furthermore only sparse data from randomized clinical trials exist to guide therapy decisions. This review article proposes a management algorithm for patients with stage III NSCLC that is based upon the currently available data on surgical therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. By necessity, given the paucity of strong data, a good deal of opinion is offered. The choice to proceed with aggressive, combined modality treatment is presented in light of extent of local disease as well as patient performance status.

### Molecular testing guideline for selection of lung cancer patients for EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors: guideline from the college of American pathologists, international association for the study of lung cancer, and Association for Molecular Pathology [^112xVcZd]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 3 — Section I, Question 1 (patient selection for EGFR and ALK testing) presents the following guidance: Recommendation: EGFR molecular testing should be used to select patients for EGFR-targeted TKI therapy, and patients with lung adenocarcinoma should not be excluded from testing on the basis of clinical characteristics; Recommendation: ALK molecular testing should be used to select patients for ALK-targeted TKI therapy, and patients with lung adenocarcinoma should not be excluded from testing on the basis of clinical characteristics. In resection specimens, EGFR and ALK testing is recommended for adenocarcinoma and mixed lung cancers with an adenocarcinoma component, and in fully excised specimens EGFR and ALK testing is not recommended in lung cancers that lack any adenocarcinoma component. In limited specimens where an adenocarcinoma component cannot be completely excluded, EGFR and ALK testing may be performed in cases showing squamous or small cell histology but clinical criteria (eg, young age, lack of smoking history) may be useful for selecting a subset. For initial treatment selection, primary tumors or metastatic lesions are equally suitable for testing, and for multiple, apparently separate, primary lung adenocarcinomas each tumor may be tested but testing of multiple different areas within a single tumor is not necessary.

- multifocal disease has resulted in significant lung restriction and respiratory compromise

- medical oncology therapies have failed or are contraindicated

### Commentary: exquisite surgical techniques and comprehensive oncologic theory are two fundamental requirements of learning lung cancer surgery [^114Dj9on]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The success of pneumonectomy in the treatment of lung cancer in 1933 and the principle of lobectomy for lung cancer treatment established by Ginsburg and Rubinsteinhave had an important impact on clinical practice, and their basic principles are still in use today. However, more recently, lung cancer is no longer viewed as traditional "lung cancer" but 2 different types of lung cancer: solid non–small cell lung cancer, which has the traditional characteristics, and adenocarcinoma with a ground-glass opacity (GGO) component. For the latter, we must have a new understanding: (1) the new classification of lung adenocarcinoma proposed by Travis and colleaguesintroduces "multidisciplinary" evaluation of malignant biological behavior of lung adenocarcinoma to the single pathologic "gold standard" and its significance. (2) The results of JCOG 0201, JCOG 0804, and JCOG0802 showed that sublobectomy may be appropriate for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with GGO component. The aforementioned factors indicate the following: (1) for early-stage lung cancer with a GGO component, the prognosis, the extent of resection, and the possibility of lymph node metastasis depend on the size of the tumor, the proportion of GGO to solid component, and the location of the tumor (peripheral or central). (2) Most of the pure GGOs with a diameter less than 3 cm are indolent tumors; we may have a new understanding of whether surgical intervention is needed, the extent of resection (a tendency toward more limited surgical extent), and the scope of lymph node dissection (may hinder smaller range). Besides these factors, the detection of tumor cells in peripheral blood, which is still a hot research topic, may have an impact on surgical decision-making. Because the scope of surgery for early-stage lung cancer may be small, and there is a question of whether surgical intervention is needed for pure GGO-like lung adenocarcinoma with a diameter of less than 3 cm, surgeons should avoid unnecessary major surgery or even any surgery.

Context

- In 2013, an evidence-based guideline was published by the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for Molecular Pathology to set standards for the molecular analysis of lung cancers to guide treatment decisions with targeted inhibitors. New evidence has prompted an evaluation of additional laboratory technologies, targetable genes, patient populations, and tumor types for testing.

Objective

- To systematically review and update the 2013 guideline to affirm its validity; to assess the evidence of new genetic discoveries, technologies, and therapies; and to issue an evidence-based update.

Design

- The College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the Association for Molecular Pathology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based guideline to help define the key questions and literature search terms, review abstracts and full articles, and draft recommendations.

Results

- Eighteen new recommendations were drafted. The panel also updated 3 recommendations from the 2013 guideline.

Conclusions

- The 2013 guideline was largely reaffirmed with updated recommendations to allow testing of cytology samples, require improved assay sensitivity, and recommend against the use of immunohistochemistry for EGFR testing. Key new recommendations include ROS1 testing for all adenocarcinoma patients; the inclusion of additional genes (ERBB2, MET, BRAF, KRAS, and RET) for laboratories that perform next-generation sequencing panels; immunohistochemistry as an alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK and/or ROS1 testing; use of 5% sensitivity assays for EGFR T790M mutations in patients with secondary resistance to EGFR inhibitors; and the use of cell-free DNA to "rule in" targetable mutations when tissue is limited or hard to obtain.

EGFR T790M testing after progression on EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in lung adenocarcinoma — strong recommendation: In lung adenocarcinoma patients who harbor sensitizing EGFR mutations and have progressed after treatment with an EGFR-targeted TKI, EGFR T790M mutational testing should be used to guide selection of treatment with third-generation EGFR inhibitors. The strength of evidence was adequate to support the use of EGFR T790M mutation testing when selecting patients for third-generation EGFR-targeted therapy, and this recommendation is evidence based and supported by 5 studies, including 1 MA, 2 single-arm phase I nonrandomized clinical trials, 1 PCS, and 1 RCS.

Objective

To establish evidence-based recommendations for the molecular analysis of lung cancers that are required to guide EGFR- and ALK-directed therapies, addressing which patients and samples should be tested, and when and how testing should be performed.

Participants

Three cochairs without conflicts of interest were selected, one from each of the 3 sponsoring professional societies: College of American Pathologists, International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and Association for Molecular Pathology. Writing and advisory panels were constituted from additional experts from these societies.

Evidence

Three unbiased literature searches of electronic databases were performed to capture articles published from January 2004 through February 2012, yielding 1533 articles whose abstracts were screened to identify 521 pertinent articles that were then reviewed in detail for their relevance to the recommendations. Evidence was formally graded for each recommendation.

Consensus Process

Initial recommendations were formulated by the cochairs and panel members at a public meeting. Each guideline section was assigned to at least 2 panelists. Drafts were circulated to the writing panel (version 1), advisory panel (version 2), and the public (version 3) before submission (version 4).

Conclusions

The 37 guideline items address 14 subjects, including 15 recommendations (evidence grade A/B). The major recommendations are to use testing for EGFR mutations and ALK fusions to guide patient selection for therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, respectively, in all patients with advanced-stage adenocarcinoma, regardless of sex, race, smoking history, or other clinical risk factors, and to prioritize EGFR and ALK testing over other molecular predictive tests. As scientific discoveries and clinical practice outpace the completion of randomized clinical trials, evidence-based guidelines developed by expert practitioners are vital for communicating emerging clinical standards. Already, new treatments targeting genetic alterations in other, less common driver oncogenes are being evaluated in lung cancer, and testing for these may be addressed in future versions of these guidelines.

### Mechanisms of and potential treatment strategies for metastatic disease in non-small cell lung cancer [^114rLe1t]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Lung cancer consumes over one million lives in the world every year, with surgical resection playing a dominant role in the curative treatment of lung cancer with nonsmall cell histology. Mortality usually is the result of systemic spread of the disease, with little impact on survival when chemotherapy is applied in the adjuvant or palliative setting. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has reached a plateau in efficacy. The future of treatment lies in the elucidation of the biology of lung cancer and the application of targeted therapies either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The impact of the first generation of targeted therapies on lung cancer has been modest, with studies suggesting improvement in response rates, but no evidence of improved survival. As we expand our understanding of the mechanisms governing lung cancer progression and metastasis, we will be able to apply the growing armamentarium against this disease with a goal toward prolonging survival and increasing the chance for cure.

### Pulmonary adenocarcinoma: the expanding spectrum of histologic variants [^116eBmm2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is one of the most common types of lung cancer. Traditionally, adenocarcinomas have been divided based on their degree of resemblance to their parent tissues into 3 histopathologic types: well, moderately, and poorly differentiated. In the majority of cases, this schema is sufficient to categorize these lung tumors. However, there is a considerable group of tumors in which the histology is not that of the classic gland-forming neoplasm. Thus, although the terminology of adenocarcinoma is applied in such cases, the histopathologic features are different from those of the more conventional variants. The current review addresses these unusual variants and the importance of recognizing and properly categorizing them to avoid unnecessary additional workup or possible misdiagnosis.

### Therapeutic interception of early lung adenocarcinoma progression: not just how, but when? [^117PhVyp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This could allow for risk stratification for the development of KM-LUAD that are smoking-associated LUAD among patients with COPD and an opportunity for therapeutic interception. It also begs the question of how we can prolong this antitumoral effect before it is superseded by other events.

Pathologists see a wide spectrum of tumor-associated stromal responses, from minimal in some invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas to some so exuberant as to almost obscure tumor cells. One element that is missing in the study of human tumors is the ability to associate these changes over time; imaging correlates provide some insight, but serial sampling of a primary lesion is very uncommon. It is possible that the mechanism proposed by these authors occurs at a time when the tumor is not clinically detectable or at a period of incipient neoplasia. Detection would require a signature that is recognizable in that incipient setting, rather than in the setting of a fully developed tumor mass, and preferably by a relatively noninvasive approach. Observations in a mouse model allow for such temporal examination, and these insights are invaluable. But if we are to successfully intercept progression of lung adenocarcinoma, understanding these phases in human tumors becomes essential — identification of the proper at-risk population is one element, but catching the phase of tumor evolution that allows interception depends on the proper characterization of protumoral versus antitumoral milieu to achieve effective tumor suppression. The right targeted therapy given at the wrong time may not have the intended effect. Put a different way, it is a question not only of how we can prolong the antitumor effect of LCN2, but when it is too late to try.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [^1168D3mX]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

With encouraging clinical activity, manageable side effects, and the potential for durable responses, immune checkpoint inhibitors have quickly become the standard of care for eligible patients with NSCLC within academic centers. Currently, clinical trials with cancer immunotherapy agents alone and in combination with other immune-based agents, targeted therapies, and cytotoxic agents (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) are underway. The eagerly anticipated results from these trials will determine what role these agents will play in treating patients with early stage disease, including the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. In addition to advances in treatment strategies, identifying and refining the use of predictive biomarkers will also be essential to identify patients who will most likely benefit from therapy. Practice-changing updates from ongoing studies will be incorporated into future versions of this guideline document.

### Complex decisions for first-line and maintenance treatment of advanced wild-type non-small cell lung cancer [^1168pJM5]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Until recently, the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) required minimal clinical decision making. Patients who were eligible for chemotherapy received a platinum-based doublet, and 5-year survival rates were poor. With the advent of molecularly targeted agents and better tolerated chemotherapies — namely, bevacizumab, erlotinib, and pemetrexed — new therapeutic opportunities have emerged. Some of the strategies that have proven to be successful for the treatment of patients with NSCLC are targeting of the vascular endothelial growth factor, use of maintenance chemotherapy for patients without progression of disease after initial therapy, and tailoring of cytotoxic agents specific to the histology of an individual patient's cancer. Each approach has been independently shown to improve overall survival, but integrating the data from a number of complicated trials into the "best" approach for patients remains challenging. This review attempts to address three fundamental questions clinicians face in choosing first-line and maintenance treatment for advanced NSCLC, particularly nonsquamous histology: Is pemetrexed or a taxane agent better for combination with platinum therapy?

### Pulmonary adenocarcinoma-targeted gene therapy by a cancer-and tissue-specific promoter system [^116to6Bv]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Gene therapy is one of the approaches used to treat lung cancer. The benefit of cancer gene therapy is that different types of tumors can be selectively targeted by tumor-specific expression of therapeutic genes that include an apoptosis gene to destroy the tumor. Previously, we described a promoter (TTS promoter) that we designed that is specifically targeted to lung cancer cells but not to other types of cancer or normal cells including stem cells. In this pursuit, we further characterize the specificity of the TTS promoter in four types of lung cancer cells (squamous cell lung carcinoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, large-cell lung carcinoma). The TTS promoter is highly active only in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells but not in the other three types of lung cancer cells. The specificity seems to be derived from transcription factor thyroid transcription factor 1-associating cofactors that affect human surfactant protein A1 promoter activity in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. We inserted the proapoptotic gene Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) into the TTS promoter (TTS/Bax). The TTS/Bax selectively causes BAX expression and cell death in pulmonary adenocarcinoma but not in other cells. Cell death caused by the BAX expression was also observed in pulmonary adenocarcinoma that is resistant to the anticancer drug gefitinib (epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor). BAX expression and cell death can be suppressed by dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid) treatment through negative glucocorticoid elements in the TTS promoter. Here we report a drug-controllable TTS/Bax system targeting pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

### Biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma: a decade of progress [^117QmZAD]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The analysis of molecular biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma (ACA) is now a central component of pathologic diagnosis and oncologic care. The identification of an EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement in advanced-stage lung ACA will dictate a change in first-line treatment from standard chemotherapy to targeted inhibition of these oncogenic alterations. Viable approaches to therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutated ACA are now under investigation, raising the possibility that this too will become an important predictive marker in this tumor type. The recognized array of less common oncogenic alterations in lung ACA, including in the ROS1, RET, BRAF, and ERBB2 genes, is growing rapidly. The therapeutic implications of these findings are, in many cases, still under investigation.

Objective

To focus on the major molecular biomarkers in lung ACA, recommended testing strategies, the implications for targeted therapies, and the mechanisms that drive development of resistance.

Data Sources

Our current understanding of predictive and prognostic markers in lung ACA is derived from a decade of technical advances, clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies. Many of the newest discoveries have emerged from application of high-throughput next-generation sequencing and gene expression analyses in clinically and pathologically defined cohorts of human lung tumors.

Conclusions

Best practices require a solid understanding of relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of patients with lung ACA.

### Machine learning reveals diverse cell death patterns in lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and therapy [^111BbP3E]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is widely recognized as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and the second most prevalent cancer globally, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being the most common histological type –. Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment modalities, the prognosis for patients remains grim, with a discouraging 5-year survival rate of merely 10–20% –. For patients diagnosed at an advanced stage, the available treatment options are limited to targeted therapy and immunotherapy. However, the high degree of heterogeneity in lung cancer and the inevitable development of drug resistance results in only a small fraction of patients responding favorably to these therapeutic approaches. In recent times, significant progress has been made in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, particularly through the use of immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1. However, the emergence of high resistance rates and low overall response rates poses a significant challenge. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further research into biomarkers that could potentially predict the efficacy of targeted and immune therapies in LUAD. Additionally, exploring the underlying mechanisms will provide potential targets and theoretical foundations for drug design and clinical decision-making.

Question 3 — molecular testing in lung cancers lacking an adenocarcinoma component states that physicians may use molecular biomarker testing in tumors with histologies other than adenocarcinoma when clinical features indicate a higher probability of an oncogenic driver, but the strength of evidence supporting the use of such testing is insufficient. On systematic review, no new evidence established routine molecular testing of any genes for typical squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, or other neuroendocrine lung tumors; rare EGFR mutations in squamous biopsies may reflect partial sampling of adenosquamous cancers and have not been borne out in fully resected squamous samples. Evidence supporting clinical utility for selection of targeted therapies remains confined to nonsquamous non–small cell lung carcinomas, predominantly adenocarcinomas or mixed cancers with an adenocarcinoma component.

Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer is still a devastating disease; however, treatment options have diversified dramatically in the past two decades. From unselected platinum-based chemotherapy for all patients, several different treatment groups have evolved, that is, those with "druggable" targets, those with a promising immune signature, and those without any predicting factors outlined in this article. Challenge includes the intersections between these groups and the optimal treatment path. These issues will be addressed in this review.

### Summary statement novel agents in the treatment of lung cancer: fifth cambridge conference assessing opportunities for combination therapy [^114jJo7C]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The promise of effective targeted therapy for lung cancer requires rigorous identification of potential targets combined with intensive discovery and development efforts aimed at developing effective "drugs" for these targets. We now recognize that getting the right drug to the right target in the right patient is more complicated than one could have imagined a decade ago. As knowledge of targets and development of agents have proliferated and advanced, so too have data demonstrating the biologic heterogeneity of tumors. The finding that lung cancers are genetically diverse and can exhibit several pathways of resistance in response to targeted agents makes the prospect for curative therapy more daunting. It is becoming increasingly clear that single-agent treatment will be the exception rather than the rule. This information raises important new questions about the development and assessment of novel agents in lung cancer treatment: (1) How do we identify the most important drug targets for tumor initiation and maintenance? (2) What is the best way to assess drug candidates that may only be relevant in a small fraction of patients? (3) What models do we use to predict clinical response and identify effective combinations? And (4) how do we bring combination regimens to the clinic, particularly when the agents are not yet approved individually and may be under development from different companies? The Fifth Cambridge Conference on Novel Agents in the Treatment of Lung Cancer was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 1–2, 2007, to discuss these questions by reviewing recent progress in the field and advancing recommendations for research and patient care. New information, conclusions, and recommendations considered significant for the field by the program faculty are summarized here and presented at greater length in the individual articles and accompanying discussions that comprise the full conference proceedings.

### Special treatment issues in lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^116Z2hch]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This chapter of the guidelines addresses patients who have particular forms of non-small cell lung cancer that require special considerations. This includes patients with Pancoast tumors, T4N0,1M0 tumors, satellite nodules in the same lobe, synchronous and metachronous multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs), solitary brain and adrenal metastases, and chest wall involvement.

Methods

The nature of these special clinical cases is such that in most cases, metaanalyses or large prospective studies of patients are not available. For ensuring that these guidelines were supported by the most current data available, publications that were appropriate to the topics covered in this chapter were obtained by performance of a literature search of the MEDLINE computerized database. When possible, we also referenced other consensus opinion statements. Recommendations were developed by the writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see "Methodology for Lung Cancer Evidence Review and Guideline Development" chapter), and reviewed by all members of the lung cancer panel before approval by the Thoracic Oncology NetWork, Health and Science Policy Committee, and the Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians.

Results

In patients with a Pancoast tumor, a multimodality approach seems to be optimal, involving chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection, provided appropriate staging has been conducted. Patients with central T4 tumors that do not have mediastinal node involvement are uncommon. Such patients, however, seem to benefit from resection as part of the treatment as opposed to chemoradiotherapy alone when carefully staged and selected. Patients with a satellite lesion in the same lobe as the primary tumor have a good prognosis and require no modification of the approach to evaluation and treatment than what would be dictated by the primary tumor alone. However, it is difficult to know how best to treat patients with a focus of the same type of cancer in a different lobe. Although MPLCs do occur, the survival results after resection for either a synchronous presentation or a metachronous presentation with an interval of < 4 years between tumors are variable and generally poor, suggesting that many of these patients may have had a pulmonary metastasis rather than a second primary lung cancer. A thorough and careful evaluation of these patients is warranted to try to differentiate between patients with a metastasis and a second primary lung cancer, although criteria to distinguish them have not been defined. Selected patients with a solitary focus of metastatic disease in the brain or adrenal gland seem to benefit substantially from resection. This is particularly true in patients with a long disease-free interval. Finally, in patients with chest wall involvement, as long as tumors can be completely resected and there is absence of N2 nodal involvement, primary surgical treatment should be considered.

Conclusions

Carefully selected patients may benefit from an aggressive surgical approach.

### Leveraging mitochondrial-programmed cell death dynamics to enhance prognostic accuracy and immunotherapy efficacy in lung adenocarcinoma [^114VAUTG]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant lung tumors are the most common malignant tumors of the respiratory system and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. The WHO classifies malignant lung tumors based on histological type into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with the former accounting for approximately 85% and the latter 15%. NSCLC primarily includes adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of NSCLC, comprising about 40% of lung cancer cases. Although surgery is the most effective treatment for stage I to II and some stage IIIA LUAD, the invasive nature of these tumors often makes complete surgical resection challenging. The advent of immunotherapy has ushered in a new era for LUAD patients, with immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improving clinical outcomes and offering a neoadjuvant immunotherapy option for early resectable disease. Unfortunately, research indicates that while immunotherapy significantly improves the prognosis for some patients, the 5-year survival rate remains only 4%–10%. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and develop reliable molecular classification models to effectively assess prognosis and guide personalized treatment strategies for LUAD patients.

### Current readings: pathology, prognosis, and lung cancer [^1141YFgY]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The 2011 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma introduced the new categories of adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, and replaced the category of mixed subtype adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and solid predominant adenocarcinoma. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate whether the new classification can be applied successfully in determining prognosis of surgically resected patients. Six consecutive clinicopathologic studies using the new classification that were published between spring 2011 and fall 2012 were reviewed. Overall, they demonstrated excellent outcome for adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma; intermediate outcome for lepidic, acinar, and papillary predominant adenocarcinoma; and poor outcome for solid and micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma and invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. As the new classification remains a proposal at this time, it is hoped that thoracic surgeons will play a leading role in its worldwide dissemination for clinical care and research.

Consequently, for subsolid cancers ≥ 2 cm, a lobectomy should be considered because of a greater chance of recurrence.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114mfVTW]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with good or low surgical risk is primarily surgical resection. However, this area is undergoing many changes. With a greater prevalence of CT imaging, many lung cancers are being found that are small or constitute primarily ground-glass opacities. Treatment such as sublobar resection and nonsurgical approaches such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are being explored. With the advent of minimally invasive resections, the criteria to classify a patient as too ill to undergo an anatomic lung resection are being redefined.

Methods

The writing panel selected topics for review based on clinical relevance to treatment of early-stage lung cancer and the amount and quality of data available for analysis and relative controversy on best approaches in stage I and II NSCLC: general surgical care vs specialist care; sublobar vs lobar surgical approaches to stage I lung cancer; video-assisted thoracic surgery vs open resection; mediastinal lymph node sampling vs lymphadenectomy at the time of surgical resection; the use of radiation therapy, with a focus on SBRT, for primary treatment of early-stage NSCLC in high-risk or medically inoperable patients as well as adjuvant radiation therapy in the sublobar and lobar resection settings; adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage NSCLC; and the impact of ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic status on lung cancer survival. Recommendations by the writing committee were based on an evidence-based review of the literature and in accordance with the approach described by the Guidelines Oversight Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians.

Results

Surgical resection remains the primary and preferred approach to the treatment of stage I and II NSCLC. Lobectomy or greater resection remains the preferred approach to T1b and larger tumors. The use of sublobar resection for T1a tumors and the application of adjuvant radiation therapy in this group are being actively studied in large clinical trials. Every patient should have systematic mediastinal lymph node sampling at the time of curative intent surgical resection, and mediastinal lymphadenectomy can be performed without increased morbidity. Perioperative morbidity and mortality are reduced and long-term survival is improved when surgical resection is performed by a board-certified thoracic surgeon. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II NSCLC is recommended and has shown benefit. The use of adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy for stage I NSCLC is of unproven benefit. Primary radiation therapy remains the primary curative intent approach for patients who refuse surgical resection or are determined by a multidisciplinary team to be inoperable. There is growing evidence that SBRT provides greater local control than standard radiation therapy for high-risk and medically inoperable patients with NSCLC. The role of ablative therapies in the treatment of high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC is evolving. Radiofrequency ablation, the most studied of the ablative modalities, has been used effectively in medically inoperable patients with small (< 3 cm) peripheral NSCLC that are clinical stage I.

### Immunotherapy for advanced-stage squamous cell lung cancer: the state of the art and outstanding questions [^117PnV5q]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment paradigm for advanced-stage squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (LUSC), a histological subtype associated with inferior outcomes compared with lung adenocarcinoma. However, only a subset of patients derive durable clinical benefit. In the first-line setting, multiple ICI regimens are available, including anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies as monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, or with an anti-CTLA4 antibody with or without chemotherapy. Several important questions persist regarding the optimal regimen for individual patients, particularly how to identify patients who might benefit from adding chemotherapy and/or anti-CTLA4 antibodies to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. An urgent need exists for predictive biomarkers beyond PD-L1 to better guide precision oncology approaches. Deeper knowledge of the underlying molecular biology of LUSC and its implications for response to ICIs will be important in this regard. Integration of this knowledge into multi-omics methods coupled with artificial intelligence might enable the development of more robust biomarkers. Finally, several novel therapeutic strategies, including novel ICIs, bispecific antibodies and personalized cancer vaccines, are emerging. Addressing these unresolved questions through innovative clinical trials and translational research will be crucial to further improving the outcomes of patients with LUSC. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of current immunotherapeutic approaches, unresolved challenges and emerging strategies for patients with LUSC.

CAP/IASLC/AMP testing after relapse on targeted therapy (Key Question 4) states that in lung adenocarcinoma patients who harbor sensitizing EGFR mutations and have progressed after treatment with an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, physicians must use EGFR T790M mutational testing when selecting patients for third-generation EGFR-targeted therapy (Strong recommendation). Laboratories testing for EGFR T790M mutation in patients with secondary clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors should deploy assays capable of detecting EGFR T790M mutations in as little as 5% of viable cells (Recommendation). There is currently insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for or against routine testing for ALK mutational status for lung adenocarcinoma patients with sensitizing ALK mutations who have progressed after treatment with an ALK-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (No recommendation).

POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT

Postoperative radiotherapy

Radiotherapy is not indicated in patients with stage I and II N0-N1 tumours, if excision was complete (standard, level of evidence: A). New radiotherapy techniques should be evaluated in patients with stage III tumours in the setting of a randomised clinical trial to assess their efficacy (recommendation).

Adjuvant chemotherapy

The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated. Adjuvant chemotherapy should only be performed in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation).

Background

Lung cancer remains the number one cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States and much of the world. This CHEST guideline examines the literature on primary treatment of patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the treatment options for patients with stage I/II NSCLC and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and grading of recommendations. A modified Delphi approach was used to reach consensus on recommendations.

Results

Based on 578 studies, the panel developed 17 recommendations.

Conclusions

The best treatment for average or low operative risk patients with stage I NSCLC remains surgical resection. In patients with stage I NSCLC, a minimally invasive approach is preferred over thoracotomy. For the first time, a meta-analysis comparing overall survival for patients with stage I lung cancer reveals an association between minimally invasive surgery and better patient outcomes. New evidence reveals equivalent overall survival for patients with peripheral ≤ 2 cm non-small cell lung cancer treated with a sublobar resection compared to lobectomy. To have confidence in the generalizability of these trials it is important to perform systematic intraoperative mediastinal and hilar lymph node sampling or dissection during operations for patients with stage I and II NSCLC. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage II NSCLC plus checkpoint inhibitors, including those patients with ≥ 4 cm node negative tumors, improves overall survival. In patients with resected stage IB (≥ 3 cm) and II epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancers, adjuvant targeted therapy improves overall survival. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is the preferred approach to patients with stage I NSCLC who are not considered appropriate candidates for surgical resection.

Tumor genetic testing is standard of care for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, but the fraction of patients who derive clinical benefit remains undefined. Here, we report the experience of 860 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma analyzed prospectively for mutations in > 300 cancer-associated genes. Potentially actionable genetic events were stratified into one of four levels based upon published clinical or laboratory evidence that the mutation in question confers increased sensitivity to standard or investigational therapies. Overall, 37.1% (319/860) of patients received a matched therapy guided by their tumor molecular profile. Excluding alterations associated with standard-of-care therapy, 14.4% (69/478) received matched therapy, with a clinical benefit of 52%. Use of matched therapy was strongly influenced by the level of preexistent clinical evidence that the mutation identified predicts for drug response. Analysis of genes mutated significantly more often in tumors without known actionable mutations nominated STK11 and KEAP1 as possible targetable mitogenic drivers. Significance: An increasing number of therapies that target molecular alterations required for tumor maintenance and progression have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The data reported here suggest that broader, early testing for molecular alterations that have not yet been recognized as standard-of-care predictive biomarkers of drug response could accelerate the development of targeted agents for rare mutational events and could result in improved clinical outcomes.

Lung cancer molecular testing guidelines — evidence grade, urgency, and reflex testing: Evidence Grade is listed as EGFR: A; ALK: C, with the note that patients with advanced-stage disease have short life expectancies, on the order of 4 to 5 months in the absence of treatment. It states that patients with EGFR mutations/ALK rearrangements show superior outcomes when the targeted TKI therapies are administered as first-line agents and that molecular testing should be initiated as soon as a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is established. The document adds that reflex testing is appropriate if agreed on by the lung cancer care team and may help to ensure expedited and consistent routing; testing is not necessary for patients with stage IV disease who are being considered for palliative or hospice care only; and when a more suitable diagnostic specimen is expected, molecular testing should be deferred to the subsequent, more generous sample.

Iressa Pan-Asia Study (IPASS) first-line gefitinib vs carboplatin-paclitaxel — trial design and outcomes: IPASS was performed in nine countries across Asia, required advanced adenocarcinoma with a never or low smoking history (≤ 10 pack-years and ≥ 15 years since quitting), randomized patients to first-line gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel, and accrued 1,217 patients; gefitinib showed superior PFS in the overall cohort (PFS HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85). EGFR mutation analysis was performed on 437 patients (35.9%), 60% were mutation-positive; among the 261 known EGFR mutants, PFS improved (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36–0.64) with an increased response rate (71% on gefitinib vs 47% on chemotherapy). Mutation-negative patients treated with first-line gefitinib did fairly poorly (PFS HR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05–3.98), and the text states that it is harmful to treat patients who do not harbor EGFR mutations with first-line EGFR TKIs and that patients are best served by performing genotype testing to determine the most appropriate first-line treatment.

### Transcriptional subtypes resolve tumor heterogeneity and identify vulnerabilities to MEK inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma [^1174MNwL]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lung adenocarcinomas comprise the largest fraction of non-small cell lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Seventy-five percent of adenocarcinomas lack targeted therapies because of scarcity of druggable drivers. Here, we classified tumors on the basis of signaling similarities and discovered subgroups within this unmet patient population.

Experimental Design

We leveraged transcriptional data from > 800 early- and advanced-stage patients.

Results

We identified three robust subtypes dubbed mucinous, proliferative, and mesenchymal with respective pathway phenotypes. These transcriptional states lack discrete and causative mutational etiology as evidenced by similarly distributed oncogenic drivers, including KRAS and EGFR. The subtypes capture heterogeneity even among tumors lacking known oncogenic drivers. Paired multi-regional intratumoral biopsies demonstrated unified subtypes despite divergently evolved prooncogenic mutations, indicating subtype stability during selective pressure. Heterogeneity among in vitro and in vivo preclinical models is expounded by the human lung adenocarcinoma subtypes and can be leveraged to discover subtype-specific vulnerabilities. As proof of concept, we identified differential subtype response to MEK pathway inhibition in a chemical library screen of 89 lung cancer cell lines, which reproduces across model systems and a clinical trial.

Conclusions

Our findings support forward translational relevance of transcriptional subtypes, where further exploration therein may improve lung adenocarcinoma treatment. See related commentary by Skoulidis, p. 913.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaNoninvasive clinical staging of primary lung cancer [^116xq5tE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. The major risk factor for lung cancer is personal tobacco smoking, particularly for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and squamous cell lung cancers, but other significant risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, environmental radon, occupational exposures, and air pollution. Education and socioeconomic status affect both incidence and outcomes. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, comprises about 85% of lung cancers. SCLC accounts for approximately 13% to 15% of cases. Prognosis is directly related to stage at presentation. NSCLC is staged using the eighth edition of the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. For SCLC the eighth edition of TNM staging is recommended to be used in conjunction with the modified Veterans Administration Lung Study Group classification system distinguishing limited stage from extensive stage SCLC. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Alveolar differentiation drives resistance to KRAS inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma [^111jBbS6]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), commonly driven by KRAS mutations, is responsible for 7% of all cancer mortality. The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors were recently approved in LUAD, but the clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples, we found inhibition of KRAS promotes transition to a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. Similarly, suppressing Kras induced AT1 differentiation of wild-type AT2 cells upon lung injury. The AT1-like LUAD cells exhibited high growth and differentiation potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells robustly improved treatment response to KRAS inhibitors. Our results uncover an unexpected role for KRAS in promoting intratumoral heterogeneity and suggest that targeting alveolar differentiation may augment KRAS-targeted therapies in LUAD.

Significance

Treatment resistance limits response to KRAS inhibitors in LUAD patients. We find LUAD residual disease following KRAS targeting is composed of AT1-like cancer cells with the capacity to reignite tumorigenesis. Targeting the AT1-like cells augments responses to KRAS inhibition, elucidating a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS-targeted therapy.

### An ensemble deep learning model for risk stratification of invasive lung adenocarcinoma using thin-slice CT [^113KvGH6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, as additional insights into early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, the surgical treatments for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma have gradually changed. With the release of the results for two clinical trials, JCOG0802and CALGB140503, sublobar resection has been established as a surgical treatment of early-stage lung cancer. However, many studies have found that IAC with micropapillary or solid pattern results in a high relapse rate. For patients with predominant and high-grade patterns (solid, micropapillary, or complex gland), lobectomy may still be the best suitable surgical treatment. Due to the different histologic subtypes of adenocarcinoma associated with different prognoses, the latest IASLC grading system classifies pulmonary IAC into three grades: Grade 1 (well differentiated), Grade 2 (moderately differentiated), and Grade 3 (poorly differentiated). Hence, if the pathological grades of IAC can be accurately predicted using preoperative CT images, it will effectively assist thoracic surgeons in choosing the appropriate surgical treatment. In the current study, we used a deep learning-based model to predict the pathological grade of early-stage IAC for the first time. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.6%, which is much higher than that obtained by senior radiologists in the observational study, demonstrating the significant advantage of AI-based methods in predicting the pathological subtypes of IAC. Given the large training size (average 3500 chest CT per year) and train years (average 13 years) of senior radiologists, one of the advantages of the AI-model is its efficiency. Our model, which was trained on only 843 nodules, has surpassed experienced clinical doctors in tumor pathological grading. This indicates that AI model can extract details of tumor more comprehensively and effectively than the naked eye, and are superior to doctors in identifying pathological subtypes. It is well known that there are distinct radiographic features in the differentiation of benign, malignant, and pre-invasive nodules, which can help clinicians identify these nodules. For example, MIA shows a ground-glass predominant nodule 3 cm or smaller with a solid component that should appear 0.5 cm or small. However, there is a lack of typical CT imaging features among histological grades in invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma. In this regard, it disfavors thoracic surgeons in evaluating the risk of nodules using 2D CT images. Although in some previous studies, pathologists could identify the high-grade patterns of lung adenocarcinoma by intraoperative frozen sections, the detection consistency among different pathologists was unsatisfactory, with an overall accuracy of approximately 74%. Meanwhile, relying solely on the intraoperative frozen results to select the surgical treatment of invasive lung adenocarcinoma may affect the implementation of segmentectomy and the extent of lymph node dissection. Besides, given that the small amount of tissue examined with pre-surgical biopsy, a poor agreement was observed between post-surgical histology and pre-surgical biopsy for pathological grade. In our study, we developed an AI-based classification algorithm for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma using CT images (Task 3). The classification is based on the latest grading system established by the IASLC pathology panel. Our model achieved an accuracy of 88.2%, 78.9%, and 88.2% for well (Grade1), moderately (Grade2), and poorly (Grade3) differentiated adenocarcinoma, respectively. In terms of risk stratification of invasive lung adenocarcinoma, our results are superior and slightly better than those achieved by doctors and intraoperative frozen pathology, respectively. Thus, it can effectively assist thoracic surgeons in selecting surgical treatments because these prediction results are based on preoperative CT scans.

### Advancements in diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients under ECMO support: a case series and comprehensive literature review [^115S2kwE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This case series explores the use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) as a bridge to diagnosis and treatment in patients with suspected lung adenocarcinoma and severe respiratory failure refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. We present three cases where ECMO support was initiated to facilitate further diagnostic evaluations, including lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid liquid biopsy, enabling the identification of actionable mutations and guiding targeted therapies. Two patients achieved significant clinical improvement and were successfully weaned from ECMO, while one patient experienced an unfavorable outcome due to a combination of uncontrolled tumor progression and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Our findings suggest that ECMO, traditionally considered a relative contraindication in advanced cancer, can be a valuable temporary support in carefully selected patients, allowing time for diagnosis and targeted treatment initiation. Furthermore, our experience highlights the feasibility and safety of performing lung biopsies under ECMO with appropriate anticoagulation management. This study emphasizes the importance of individualized decision-making and a multidisciplinary approach when considering ECMO for lung cancer patients, carefully weighing the risks of infection and disease progression to optimize patient outcomes.

Multifocal lung cancer (MFLC) — the approach used here is to define such patients according to clinical features as opposed to pathologic features. MFLCs are defined as multiple lesions arising from ground glass opacities (GGOs), which may develop a solid component, and there may be a limited number or multiple lesions. The definition includes patients with a GGO lesion suspected or proven to be malignant and other small GGO lesions that are more likely adenomatous alveolar hyperplasia (AAH) than an invasive carcinoma, and also includes patients with an infiltrative pattern of disease either confined to a particular area (segment or lobe) or appearing diffusely in the lung parenchyma (also called pneumonic type of adenocarcinoma); these conditions should also be included among multifocal cancers.

### Application and progress of non-invasive imaging in predicting lung invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma under the new IASLC grading guidelines [^113h7hZU]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with its incidence and mortality rates topping those of all cancers in many countries. Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common histological type, exhibits various histological patterns and proportions, showing significant heterogeneity in molecular characteristics, pathological presentation, prognosis, and treatment, with generally poor outcomes. About 70% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma are already at an advanced stage when diagnosed. Among all types of lung adenocarcinoma, invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (INMA) is the most prevalent. Therefore, it is particularly important to accurately grade and diagnose them. However, previous grading systems have mostly relied on a single assessment of the predominant growth pattern, which is difficult to fully reflect the complexity of tumors and has insufficient correlation with the patient's prognosis. To improve the prognosis of patients with lung INMA, in 2020, the pathology committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) proposed a new lung INMA grading system, which was adopted by the 2021 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of thoracic tumors. This new system quantifies histological subtypes and their proportions in lung INMA, significantly improving the precision in patient prognostic stratification compared to previous grading systems focused on a single predominant growth pattern. Accurate preoperative tumor grading is crucial in determining the treatment strategy for patients with lung INMA (including the scope of surgical resection, lymph node dissection methods, and whether to receive adjuvant therapy before and after surgery). Therefore, early identification and histological grading of lung INMA is important for optimizing patient management and achieving personalized precision diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer.

What is lung cancer. Lung cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer in both men and women, about 28% of all cancer deaths. In 2010, an estimated 222, 520 Americans were expected to have been diagnosed with lung cancer and 157, 300 were expected to have died from the disease. 1 The prognosis for lung cancer is poor; most lung cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced cancer and only 16% of patients will survive for five years after their diagnosis. In this work, TCGA researchers studied the most common type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancers. Specifically, the subtypes are called lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Additional information on lung cancer. What have TCGA researchers learned about lung adenocarcinoma.
- Found further evidence that lung adenocarcinoma has a high rate of mutations compared to other cancers.
- 76% of cases studied harbored activation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, which alter signaling and causes increased cell proliferation. The activation may be caused by:

- 18 significantly mutated genes, including previously known drivers. KRAS, EGFR, and BRAF
- Novel oncogenic drivers, such as tumor suppressor NF1, which normally keep receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in check
- 18 significantly mutated genes, including previously known drivers
- The cancer can be categorized into three distinct subtypes based on gene expression data:

- Proximal proliferative, proximal inflammatory, and terminal respiratory unit.

Through a coordinated effort by CPTAC-affiliated Proteome Characterization Centers, Proteogenomic Translational Research Centers, and Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers, CPTAC aims to comprehensively characterize human cancers. To explore the biology of lung adenocarcinoma and identify new therapeutic opportunities, we performed comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of 110 tumors and 101matched normal adjacent tissues incorporating genomics, epigenomics, deep-scale proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and acetylproteomics. Multi-omics clustering revealed four subgroups defined by key driver mutations, country, and gender. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data illuminated biology downstream of copy number aberrations, somatic mutations, and fusions and identified therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with driver events involving KRAS, EGFR, and ALK.

Immune subtyping revealed a complex landscape, reinforced the association of STK11 with immune-cold behavior, and underscored a potential immunosuppressive role of neutrophil degranulation. Smoking-associated LUADs showed correlation with other environmental exposure signatures and a field effect in NATs. Matched NATs allowed identification of differentially expressed proteins with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility. This proteogenomics dataset represents a unique public resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to better understand and treat lung adenocarcinomas.
