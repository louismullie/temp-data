## Question

What is the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of corticosteroids in pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis, including when to use them, how to dose and taper, how to monitor response, what to do if steroids fail, and how to manage special situations like chronic pneumonitis and rechallenge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its severity grading. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence supporting corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Next, I will review dosing by severity, tapering, and early reassessment windows. After that, I need to check steroid-refractory definitions and second-line options. I will then examine chronic pneumonitis and recurrence risks, consider rechallenge, and finally address special populations and practical pearls, making sure I continuously cross-check guideline concordance and key studies throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and severity framework. Pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis is an immune-related adverse event characterized by focal or diffuse lung inflammation on CT, with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and occasionally chest pain or fever; onset is typically within weeks to months of therapy, though late presentations occur, and severity is graded 1–4 by symptoms, oxygen needs, and extent of lung involvement, which guides management decisions and steroid intensity [^113T8PDR] [^115j3RzX] [^113dgGMT].

> I need to verify the evidentiary basis for corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are no randomized trials proving steroid efficacy in ICI pneumonitis; recommendations are based on consensus guidelines and observational data showing that most patients improve with ICI withdrawal plus steroids, with response rates around 88% in pooled series and clinical improvement in the majority of cases, though this is lower in real-world cohorts and varies by severity and phenotype [^111JbUeC] [^11197Zbw] [^114dJtw8].

> Next, I should review dosing by severity. For grade 2 pneumonitis, prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) with a 4–6 week taper after improvement to grade 1 is standard; for grade ≥ 3, IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day is recommended, with a longer taper over 6–8 weeks, and all major guidelines align on these ranges, including FDA labeling that instructs 1–2 mg/kg/day until improvement to grade 1, then taper over at least 1 month [^113T8PDR] [^11299S8P] [^113dgGMT] [^115b45vA].

> Wait, let me verify the early reassessment window and what to do if there is no improvement. ASCO and SITC advise reassessing clinically within 48–72 hours of high-dose steroids; lack of improvement by 48–72 hours is generally labeled steroid-refractory and should trigger escalation to additional immunosuppression rather than waiting, given the risk of progression and mortality in refractory cases [^113T8PDR] [^113dgGMT] [^1171xjqP].

> I will now examine steroid-refractory disease and second-line options. Steroid-refractory pneumonitis accounts for roughly 18–20% of cases and carries high mortality; options include infliximab 5 mg/kg, mycophenolate mofetil 1–1.5 g twice daily, IVIG 2 g/kg divided over 2–5 days, cyclophosphamide, or tocilizumab, but prospective comparative data are lacking and outcomes vary, with some series showing poor response to infliximab and others suggesting durable improvement in a subset with IVIG or MMF; I should double-check that guidelines do not endorse a single preferred agent, which is correct [^1139sCNV] [^116rNgjw] [^113dgGMT] [^117QtwQt].

> But wait, what if the course is chronic or relapsing despite taper? Chronic ICI pneumonitis occurs in about 2% and is defined by persistence or recurrence with steroid taper, often requiring ≥ 12 weeks of immunosuppression and sometimes steroid-sparing agents; radiologic organizing pneumonia patterns and BAL lymphocytosis are common in this phenotype, and flares during taper are typical, necessitating cautious, prolonged tapers and close monitoring [^111YJVbf] [^116BN1qJ] [^112astsP].

> Next, I should review recurrence and rechallenge. Recurrent pneumonitis occurs in about 25% after clinical resolution, both with and without ICI rechallenge; if rechallenge is considered after grade 2 disease, it should occur only after complete resolution off steroids with enhanced surveillance, and many experts favor avoiding rechallenge after grade ≥ 3 given severity and mortality risk; I need to ensure I note that guidelines allow individualized rechallenge in selected grade 2 cases with informed consent and close monitoring [^115hePzK] [^113o1Txq] [^112hisjW].

> I need to ensure supportive care and infection risk are addressed. High-dose steroids increase infection risk, and opportunistic infections are not rare in immunosuppressed ICI patients; some clinicians use Pneumocystis prophylaxis when prolonged high-dose steroids are anticipated, and any diagnostic uncertainty warrants infectious workup, with bronchoscopy and BAL considered in severe or unclear cases to exclude infection before intensifying immunosuppression [^113CPPAX] [^114vxrcX] [^115rqQBv].

> Let me consider special populations and practical pearls. Patients with pre-existing ILD or low baseline lung function are at higher risk for severe pneumonitis and may warrant baseline PFTs and specialist input; diabetes can be destabilized by high-dose steroids, requiring proactive glycemic management and dose adjustments as needed; and I should confirm that underdosing steroids below 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent has been associated with partially steroid-responsive or refractory courses, reinforcing adherence to guideline dosing ranges [^113dgGMT] [^115sykSo] [^115wucv9].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency I initially thought I saw regarding onset timing. I first recalled a median onset of 34 weeks, but that conflicts with trial and real-world data showing median onsets around 2–3 months; wait, let me verify — ASCO's definition includes a wide range with a median of 34 weeks in some analyses, whereas FDA labels and large series consistently cite medians near 2–3 months, so both can be correct depending on cohorts and definitions, and clinicians should maintain vigilance across the entire treatment timeline [^115j3RzX] [^11197Zbw] [^111rnEb9].

> Finally, I should summarize the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Suspect pneumonitis with new respiratory symptoms and CT changes; grade severity; hold pembrolizumab for grade ≥ 2 and permanently discontinue for grade ≥ 3; start prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day for grade 2 or IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for grade ≥ 3; reassess at 48–72 hours and escalate to infliximab, MMF, IVIG, cyclophosphamide, or tocilizumab if no improvement; taper slowly over 4–6 weeks for grade 2 and 6–8 weeks or longer for grade ≥ 3; anticipate chronic or relapsing courses in a minority and manage with prolonged immunosuppression; consider rechallenge only after complete resolution in carefully selected grade 2 cases with close follow-up; and proactively mitigate infection risk and comorbidity flares throughout [^113T8PDR] [^11299S8P] [^113dgGMT] [^115b45vA].

---

Corticosteroids are the **first-line therapy** for pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis, with prompt initiation of prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day (or IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for severe cases) and a taper over 4–6 weeks after clinical and radiographic improvement [^113T8PDR] [^11299S8P]. Early steroid therapy achieves **clinical improvement in most patients** [^111JbUeC], but steroid-refractory cases (about 18–20%) require escalation to infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, or cyclophosphamide [^1139sCNV] [^113T8PDR]. Delayed or inadequate steroid dosing increases the risk of progression, chronicity, and mortality, so close monitoring and adherence to guidelines are essential [^115QGgGB] [^113T8PDR].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis presents with **nonspecific symptoms** — dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and occasionally fever or chest pain [^115rqQBv]. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion, high-resolution chest CT, and exclusion of alternative etiologies such as infection, radiation pneumonitis, or tumor progression [^113dgGMT]. CT patterns commonly observed include organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage, with diffuse alveolar damage associated with the highest severity and mortality [^115B78bs].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid therapy

Corticosteroids are indicated based on the **severity of pneumonitis**, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE):

| **Grade** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended corticosteroid therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Grade 1 | Asymptomatic; radiographic changes only | - Hold or closely monitor <br/> - Consider corticosteroids if progressive [^113T8PDR] |
| Grade 2 | Symptomatic; no oxygen required | Prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day; taper over 4–6 weeks [^113T8PDR] |
| Grade 3 | Severe symptoms; oxygen required | IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day; taper over 4–6 weeks [^113dgGMT] |
| Grade 4 | Life-threatening; respiratory failure | IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day; taper over 4–6 weeks [^113T8PDR] |

---

Corticosteroids should be initiated promptly upon diagnosis, as **delayed treatment** is associated with increased severity, chronicity, and mortality [^113T8PDR].

---

## Recommended corticosteroid regimens

The **recommended corticosteroid regimens** are:

- **Initial dose**: Prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) for grade 2 pneumonitis; IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for grade 3–4 pneumonitis [^113T8PDR].
- **Duration**: Continue until clinical and radiographic improvement to grade 1 or less.
- **Taper**: Gradually taper over 4–6 weeks for grade 2, and 6–8 weeks for grade 3–4, to prevent relapse [^11299S8P].

---

## Clinical efficacy of corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are effective in the majority of cases, with clinical improvement observed in approximately 80% of patients within 48–72 hours of initiation [^1171xjqP] [^113T8PDR]. However, **approximately 18–20% of patients develop steroid-refractory pneumonitis**, necessitating additional immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].

---

## Management of steroid-refractory cases

Steroid-refractory pneumonitis is defined as **lack of clinical improvement after 48–72 hours** of high-dose corticosteroids [^1171xjqP]. In such cases, escalation to additional immunosuppressive agents is recommended:

- **Infliximab**: 5 mg/kg IV, repeat in 14 days if necessary [^113dgGMT].
- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: 1–1.5 g orally twice daily [^115G72jM].
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: 2 g/kg divided over 2–5 days [^116rNgjw].
- **Cyclophosphamide**: 1–1.5 mg/kg/day orally or IV [^notfound].

The choice of agent depends on patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and institutional preferences, as no single agent has proven superior [^116kWmcs].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of corticosteroid therapy

While corticosteroids are effective, they carry **significant risks and side effects**, particularly with prolonged use:

- **Infections**: Increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) [^113CPPAX].
- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, weight gain, and adrenal insufficiency [^1175xJtP].
- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and avascular necrosis.
- **Psychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, anxiety, and insomnia.

To mitigate these risks, patients should be monitored closely, and prophylactic measures (e.g. PCP prophylaxis, glycemic control, bone protection) should be implemented as indicated [^114vxrcX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess treatment response and detect complications early. This includes **clinical assessment** with frequent evaluation of symptoms, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status [^113T8PDR], and **radiographic assessment** with repeat chest CT at regular intervals to document improvement or resolution [^113iD7tv]. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry and DLCO) should be considered to assess functional recovery [^113dgGMT].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence

Most patients experience resolution or significant improvement of pneumonitis with corticosteroid therapy. However, **recurrence can occur in approximately 25% of patients**, particularly upon rechallenge with pembrolizumab or during corticosteroid tapering [^115b45vA] [^115B78bs]. Chronic pneumonitis, defined as persistent inflammation requiring prolonged immunosuppression, occurs in approximately 2% of patients and is associated with significant morbidity [^1174DpyC].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from ASCO, SITC, and ESMO consistently recommend corticosteroids as the **first-line therapy** for pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis, with escalation to additional immunosuppressive agents in steroid-refractory cases [^113T8PDR] [^113dgGMT] [^11299S8P]. There is ongoing research to optimize corticosteroid dosing, duration, and tapering strategies, as well as to identify predictive biomarkers for steroid responsiveness [^111F5rZm] [^115QGgGB].

---

Corticosteroids are the **cornerstone of management** for pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis, with prompt initiation and appropriate tapering essential for optimal outcomes. Steroid-refractory cases require escalation to additional immunosuppressive agents, and close monitoring is necessary to manage risks and detect recurrence early.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-pneumonitis steroid responsiveness — Most patients (88%) with ICI-pneumonitis respond to withdrawal of therapy and/or corticosteroids, but in steroid-refractory cases it is unclear whether this reflects a different mechanism of disease or an advanced stage with nonreversible lung injury; proposed research approaches include mechanistic in vitro studies, expanded animal models, and human specimens to study the small subset who do not respond to corticosteroid therapy.

ICI-pneumonitis grade 2 or greater — treatment approach and unresolved issues — details that proposed treatments include ICI cessation, systemic corticosteroids, and variable recommendations for additional immune-suppressive medications; symptomatic disease management has centered on withholding the ICI agent, treating with systemic corticosteroids over 4 to 6 weeks, and adding immunosuppressive medications in refractory cases, yet the optimal timing, dose, and duration of corticosteroid therapy, as well as the optimal dose, duration, and type of immunosuppressive treatment for steroid-refractory disease, have not been defined; a "rebound" or "flare" of worsening pneumonitis after steroid discontinuation has been described with limited guidance for further therapy, and phenotypic, radiographic, or other diagnostic findings (such as BAL differential) may clarify response and should be evaluated for guiding treatment.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113QnqzT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-pneumonitis — knowledge gaps regarding corticosteroids and steroid-sparing therapies are emphasized, as the efficacy and timing of steroid-sparing agents remain unknown, and it is similarly unknown whether infliximab, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) would be useful in relapsing or steroid-dependent disease or adversely impact tumor response to ICIs. The statement notes that one could postulate that treatment with steroids may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response, and that steroids increase the risk of infection and may not affect progression to fibrotic lung disease, each of which could worsen patient outcomes. It further highlights that determining the additive effect of steroids versus withdrawal of therapy alone or targeted, steroid-sparing therapies would help answer these questions.

ICI-pneumonitis grade 1 (asymptomatic radiographic findings) — current management and knowledge gaps — notes that current recommendations include withholding ICIs versus continuing with close ongoing monitoring (imaging, frequent clinical evaluation, and possibly pulmonary function tests), and/or corticosteroids for progressive ICI-pneumonitis; however, it is unclear which asymptomatic radiographic changes warrant management changes, whether all grade 1 patients need ICI withholding, and how, by what means, how frequently, and for how long these patients should be followed.

### Severe pneumonitis refractory to steroids following anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [^1129svHy]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance the antitumour activity of the immune system and have produced durable tumour responses in several solid tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, PD-1 inhibitors can lead to immune-related adverse events, including pneumonitis, which is typically mild, but can be severe and potentially fatal. Pneumonitis often resolves with steroids, but some cases are steroid refractory, leading to a relapsing and remitting course in milder cases or the need for salvage therapies in more severe cases. Here, we present two patients with NSCLC who developed severe pneumonitis following therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. While one patient improved with steroids and infliximab, the other patient failed to respond to steroids and subsequently died. These cases demonstrate the highly variable presentation and therapeutic responses seen in patients with pneumonitis following anti-PD-1 therapy and illustrate that severe cases can often present refractory to steroid therapy.

### Pneumonitis: a serious adverse effect of PD-L1 inhibitors including pembrolizumab [^1111SGzM]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 70-year-old man presented with breathlessness, cough and fever while receiving pembrolizumab for melanoma. A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated small bilateral upper lobe segmental pulmonary emboli with patchy ground-glass opacities and basal perilobular consolidation, in keeping with organising pneumonia. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary emboli but rapidly deteriorated, with increasing hypoxia and dyspnoea. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for support with continuous positive airway pressure and high flow nasal oxygen. His clinical condition improved once he received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone to treat pneumonitis. His treatment was continued with a weaning course of high-dose oral steroids, and he was discharged with a persistent oxygen requirement. The patient maintained a requirement for high doses of oral steroids and continued to deteriorate. He was referred to palliative care for symptom management and died a month following hospital discharge, as a result of pneumonitis due to pembrolizumab.

### Real-world insights on preferred treatments for steroid-refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis [^116rNgjw]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced pneumonitis has been considered a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE). Incidence is estimated at less than 5% of clinical trial patients, with high-grade pneumonitis occurring in less than 1% of patients who receive ICIs. However, as ICIs gain traction as standard therapies, real-world data suggest a slightly higher incidence than is seen in clinical trial populations, with ICI-induced pneumonitis occurring in up to 19% of patients. The risk of developing ICI-induced pneumonitis varies among ICI classes. Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have a higher incidence than anti-PD-L1 inhibitors or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, and combination therapy results in a higher risk of pneumonitis compared with ICI monotherapy. In addition, ICI-induced pneumonitis is most common in patients with lung cancer and is the most common anti-PD-1/L1-related cause of death across all tumor types.

ICI-induced pneumonitis generally develops within the first 3 months of treatment. High-dose steroids such as prednisone/methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day are used initially. If patients do not improve after 48–72 hours on high-dose steroids, they are classified as steroid refractory. Current consensus guidelines by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)recommend escalating immunosuppression with the addition of one of the following agents to high-dose steroids for steroid-refractory irAEs: (1) infliximab 5 mg/kg, (2) cyclosporine 2.5 mg/kg/day in divided doses, (3) mycophenolate mofetil 1–1.5 g two times a day, (4) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg in divided doses over 2–5 days, or (5) tocilizumab 0.6 mg/kg. However, consensus guidelines do not specify the preferred initial agent, the optimal order of agents, or the optimal number of doses. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitor infliximab is often the preferred first option as it has been used successfully in other irAEs such as colitis, but there are little published data on its efficacy in treating steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112WYeVU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Overview — key topics and conclusions for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis (ICI-pneumonitis) emphasize rising recognition and major research gaps. The increase in ICI use has led to more irAEs, including potentially fatal ICI-pneumonitis, and development of these events is sporadic, unpredictable, and relatively uncommon per site, making systematic study difficult. Terminology used to define, diagnose, and describe radiologic findings has been inconsistent. Proposed mechanisms include increased T-cell activity against autoantigens, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced complement-mediated inflammation, yet the key biologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Because patients with underlying rheumatologic or lung diseases have been underrepresented in trials, it is unknown if comorbid conditions increase risk, and how best to risk stratify using baseline physiologic, radiologic, and serologic evaluation is poorly understood and in need of research. Current recommendations for diagnostic evaluation lack clear evidence that they differentiate ICI-pneumonitis from infection; the role of physiologic testing (pulmonary function tests) remains undefined and should be incorporated in research studies, and the role and timing of bronchoscopy with BAL deserve further investigation. Management uncertainties include which asymptomatic radiographic changes warrant a change in management, the optimal timing, dose, and duration of steroids, and whether steroid dose and duration impact outcomes. For steroid-refractory disease, the role of steroid-sparing agents should be studied in clinical trials, and there is a major concern that steroid treatment may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response and increase infection risk.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis: focus on diagnosis and underlying mechanisms [^115RZR7p]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to provide an updated overview of the diagnosis, risk factors, and treatment strategies for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis, with a particular emphasis on its underlying pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

Recent advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the identification of biomarkers, including autoantibodies, are enhancing our understanding of ICI-related pneumonitis. These findings suggest that both cell-mediated and humoral mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of the condition.

Summary

Pneumonitis can significantly limit the efficacy of life-saving cancer treatments, such as ICIs. Although corticosteroids are the first-line treatment according to guidelines, steroid-refractory pneumonitis remains common and is associated with high mortality. Emerging data is providing a more detailed understanding of the dysregulated immune response responsible for pneumonitis, which may guide the development of targeted therapies and direct future research efforts.

### Early presentation of pembrolizumab-associated pneumonitis [^112rfuSo]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pembrolizumab is a selective anti-PD-L1 humanised monoclonal antibody approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating multiple cancers, including cervical cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and squamous head and neck cancer. Pneumonitis is a rare but known complication of pembrolizumab treatment for NSCLC. The median time frame of its appearance is 2.8 months. However, we present a case of pneumonitis appearing within 48 hours. The patient presented with rapidly progressive respiratory failure, and imaging demonstrated diffuse bilateral patchy involvement of the upper lung lobe and pre-hilar regions, which likely indicate pneumonitis. Because of likely grade 3 pneumonitis, he was treated with steroids and showed immediate improvement of symptoms. Repeated CT imaging showed resolution of bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was discharged to the rehabilitation unit. Rapid recognition of pneumonitis as a side effect of pembrolizumab is important because early treatment can help prevent respiratory failure and possible death.

Literature review and analysis

Data concerning the incidence of pulmonary irAEs have been mostly reported in large prospective trials supporting FDA-approval of the agents in question. According to these safety trials, immune-mediated pneumonitis was observed in 61/1994 (3.1%) of patients receiving nivolumab, 94/2799 (3.4%) of patients receiving pembrolizumab, and 38/1027 (3.7%) of patients who received atezolizumab. The median time to onset of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 3.5 months for nivolumab and 3.3 months for both pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. The majority of patients who developed pneumonitis while undergoing treatment were managed with corticosteroids (89, 67, and 55%, respectively). Although most irAEs were grade 1–2 and eventually resolved, two immune-related pneumonitis deaths were reported.

Consistent with safety reports, a large retrospective analysis of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents reported immune-related pneumonitis in 43/915 (4.6%) patients, with similar incidence in patients with NSCLC (26/532 [5%]) and melanoma (9/209 [4%]). Time to onset ranged from 9 days to 19.2 months (median 2.8 months) and was shorter in patients treated with combination therapy compared with single agents (median 2.7 vs 4.6 months; p = 0.02). Of the reported cases, 72% were grade 1 to 2, and 86% improved or resolved once immunotherapy was withheld and immunosuppression initiated. Treatment for pneumonitis included withholding drug (n = 15, all grade 1), initiating corticosteroids (n = 23, 2 grade 1, 14 grade 2, 6 grade 3, 1 grade 4), and using corticosteroids with additional immunosuppression from infliximab with or without cyclophosphamide (n = 5, all grade ≥ 3). During treatment for pneumonitis, five patients died but only one death was directly attributable to pneumonitis. Of note, three patients died from infections related to immunosuppression, highlighting the need for improved immunosuppression strategies.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-pneumonitis — infectious evaluation and overlap with treatment — highlights that infections are common in ICI-related adverse events and when immunosuppression is required (31% and 43.5%, respectively), with fatal infections accounting for 1–2% of deaths and potentially increased by corticosteroids, infliximab, and combination ICI therapy; when infection cannot be ruled out, symptomatic patients are often treated with antimicrobials plus corticosteroids, while ASCO/NCCN diagnostic evaluation includes infectious testing (viral nasal swabs, sputum, blood and urine cultures) but the specific tests, timing, and role of bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remain unknown, and routine BAL to exclude pulmonary infections may improve ICI-pneumonitis research going forward.

In clinical studies enrolling 389 adult patients with cHL who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent, pneumonitis occurred in 31 (8%) patients, including Grades 3–4 pneumonitis in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 21 (5.4%) patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

In a clinical study enrolling 580 adult patients with resected NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091) who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment, pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^1142T2gS]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used as new standard treatments for cancer therapy. Furthermore, several ICI therapeutic strategies have been developed, including single ICI therapy, combinations of ICI with chemotherapy and combinations of different ICIs. Unlike conventional chemotherapy that has direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells, ICIs exert their antitumoral effect by activating the antitumor responses of immune cells. Although the unique anticancer mechanism of ICI provides unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with cancer, there is also a serious issue of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The irAEs are defined as a spectrum of specific side effects of ICIs that mimic autoimmune diseases. The irAEs occur in diverse organ systems and require organ-specific management and treatment.

Immune-related pneumonitis (irP) is a potentially serious irAE and influences the course of cancer treatment. In clinical trials, the incidence of irP is reported to range from 1% to 6%. However, irP is not uncommon in a real-world setting, and the incidence and mortality of irP is reported to range from 5% to 19% and from 2% to 27%, respectively. Thus, cancer therapy is often interrupted because of treatment for irP, even if patients avoid a fatal outcome.

Treatment of irP has not been evaluated in any prospective trials, and there is no standardized, evidence-based treatment approach for irP. Guidelines recommend high-dose corticosteroids for a certain period to treat irP. However, these recommendations are based on clinical experience and consensus opinion, and the dose and duration of corticosteroid differs among guidelines. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer recommend 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent), tapered over 4–6 weeks for grade 2 irP and 1–2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone intravenously (or equivalent), tapered over 4–6 weeks for grade ≥ 3 irP. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends 2–4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone (or equivalent), tapered over 6 weeks or more for grade ≥ 3 irP.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis following discontinuation of pembrolizumab in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma: a case report and literature review [^115sykSo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The overall principle of CIP treatment is graded therapy. Currently, there are no specific grading criteria for irAEs in China. Referring to the irAEs management guidelines released by the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2018, this patient can be classified as grade 3 CIP. According to the guidelines, treatment with glucocorticoids should be initiated, with methylprednisolone at 1–2 mg·kg − 1 ·d − 1 or equivalent, gradually tapering the dose. However, in this case, the patient has diabetes mellitus, and an increase in steroid dosage led to uncontrolled blood glucose levels, necessitating a reduction in dosage. Steroid are known to promote hyperglycemia, making the exploration of effective CIP treatment alongside diabetes management particularly interesting. Hilder et al. reported that, among 12,142 cancer patients treated with ICIs, 11 had pre-existing diabetes, and 3 of these patients received high-dose steroids for irAE management. They concluded that steroid therapy for irAEs could be safely managed without adverse glycemic consequences through appropriate insulin adjustments and standard care, including diabetes management techniques and insulin therapy. Similarly, in COVID-19 patients with diabetes, studies have shown that effective glycemic control through insulin therapy improves clinical outcomes in those receiving steroids. Pofi et al. recommend frequent adjustments to steroid dosages after initiating therapy, ensuring alignment between steroid dose modifications and glycemic control strategies. In our case, methylprednisolone was reduced from 40 mg to 30 mg due to hyperglycemia, underscoring the importance of close monitoring and timely interventions in such patients. Moreover, steroid dosages may vary depending on the organ affected by irAEs. For example, irAE-induced arthralgia is often managed with lower doses, while colitis or pneumonitis typically requires higher doses. It has been reported that glucocorticoids can control CIP in over 70% of patients, although some may experience pneumonitis recurrence during glucocorticoid tapering, with an increased risk of pneumonitis recurrence upon reinitiating immunotherapy. Therefore, glucocorticoid treatment should not be abruptly discontinued, and it is recommended to gradually taper the dose after symptoms and imaging improvements. For those with poor response to glucocorticoids, combination therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide may be considered. Initially, during the diagnosis of pneumonitis, methylprednisolone 40 mg was administered intravenously once daily, but it was discontinued upon symptom improvement at discharge. However, symptoms recurred and the patient was readmitted eight days later, diagnosed with CIP. Methylprednisolone 40 mg was administered intravenously once daily, with a reduction to 30 mg one week later, along with intravenous immunoglobulin at 12.5 g once daily for three days. Two weeks later, symptoms improved, and most lesions were absorbed on chest CT. Prior literature has also reported the initiation of steroid therapy after ineffective antibiotic treatment, leading to rapid alleviation, thus underscoring the value of steroids in CIP treatment.

### Investigating risk factors and treatment options for severe, partially steroid responsive, and steroid-refractory checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^111aEbyP]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized treatment in several cancers over the last decade. ICIs upregulate the immune system by inhibiting physiologic checkpoints, including programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, and their use is rapidly growing. Unfortunately, ICI treatment is not without risk, as the increase in immune activity predisposes patients to autoimmune complications, termed immune-related adverse events (IRAE). When immune-mediated inflammation occurs in the lungs following ICI treatment, this is called ICI-pneumonitis (ICI-p).

ICI-p is one of the most devastating IRAEs and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early studies on ICI-p reported an incidence ranging from 3% to 6%. Due to increasing ICI utilization and awareness of IRAEs, recent studies have revealed the incidence to be significantly higher than previously reported, with severe ICI-p accounting for 30% of all cases. The reported mortality for ICI-p ranges from 10% to 18%, with mortality for steroid-refractory ICI-p as high as 57%. Despite the increasing incidence of ICI-p and the mortality associated with severe ICI-p, little is known regarding the risk factors for severe pneumonitis and the optimal therapeutic choice for steroid-refractory disease.

There are several patient-specific risk factors associated with ICI-p, including prior thoracic radiation, preexisting interstitial lung abnormalities, abnormalities on pulmonary function testing (PFTs), and lab abnormalities such as hypoalbuminemia, but few have been identified specifically for severe ICI-p. Major societies recommend prompt steroid administration and consideration of additional immunosuppression if patients are not responding to corticosteroids within 48–72 hours, but none make a specific recommendation on which steroid refractory medication to utilize. As ICIs are increasingly used in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting and for curative intent, it is paramount to identify patient-specific risk factors for severe ICI-p to help risk stratify which patients would benefit the most from ICI treatment.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a single-center, retrospective study on cancer patients treated with ICIs who developed ICI-p to evaluate whether abnormalities in chest imaging, PFTs, blood work, and previous treatment history would increase the risk of severe ICI-p. Using the same cohort, we compared non-steroid immune suppressants to determine the optimal secondary agent for patients with steroid-refractory ICI-p.

### Chronic immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^111YJVbf]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonitis is an uncommon but potentially fatal toxicity of anti-PD(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for cancer. The incidence of this toxicity is approximately 5% in patients with solid tumors treated with anti-PD(L)1 monotherapy, and up to 10%, in patients receiving anti-PD(L)1-based combinations such as ipilimumab/nivolumab, or those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most cases of ICI pneumonitis resolve or improve with corticosteroids; however, a small proportion of patients may develop recurrent pneumonitis when rechallenged with ICIs. Distinct from this phenomenon, we recently observed a clinical phenotype of 'chronic ICI pneumonitis', where patients exhibit persistent pneumonitis without immunotherapy rechallenge. Specifically, we observed clinical and radiographic evidence of ICI pneumonitis with exacerbation of symptoms when steroids were downtitrated, despite prompt discontinuation of ICI therapy at symptom onset, necessitating an extended course of immunosuppression to ≥ 12 weeks. This duration of corticosteroids for ICI pneumonitis is well beyond the published guideline recommendations of 4–6 weeks. Since the features of this previously unreported clinical entity are unknown, we report herein the incidence, clinical presentation, radiographic, pathological features and management of patients who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis.

### High incidence and early onset of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis: four case reports and literature review [^113MJptY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nivolumab — an immune checkpoint inhibitor — is the humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein, which is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed on T cells. It promotes immune responses by blocking the binding of PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab produces durable objective responses in patients with malignant tumors with a favorable safety profile, and is currently used for the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma (MM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and head and neck cancer (HNC).

Considering the paradigm shift towards alternative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of the above-mentioned tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors are known to cause a variety of unique toxicities that have not been well characterized. These effects termed as "immune-related adverse events (irAEs)" that include endocrine dysfunction, neurological disorder, hepatitis, nephritis, skin toxicity, cardiac insufficiency, colitis, and pneumonitis. Of these irAEs, pneumonitis is a relatively uncommon, but potentially life-threatening adverse event. A previous meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of pneumonitis associated with a monotherapy of PD-1 inhibitors, either nivolumab or another inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was 2.7% for all-grade and 0.8% for grade ≥ 3. Furthermore, this report showed that pneumonitis related to nivolumab monotherapy occurred in 4.1% (1.4–8.5%) of patients with NSCLC with all grades and 1.7% (0–3.4%) with ≥ grade 3 toxicity, while pneumonitis occurred in 1.5% (0–1.9%) of patients with MM at all grades and 0.1% (0–0.3%) with ≥ grade 3 toxicity. Although the prevalence of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis varies across tumor types, particular caution should be taken regarding this issue in NSCLC patients. A recent retrospective study demonstrated diverse computed tomography (CT) image patterns and clinical courses of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis, including predominant cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) pattern, median onset time of 2.6 months, and successful treatment with corticosteroids for most patients.

Glucocorticoid therapy for DRP is often used to ameliorate and to expedite the recovery of lung injury and is commonly used when DRP is moderate to severe and of acute or fulminant onset. However, this practice is based on retrospective studies and expert opinion because no clinical trial has been performed to prove the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy in the treatment of patients with DRP.

### Pulmonary adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors [^116h1r7k]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pre-existing ILD represents an independent risk factor for severe immune-related pneumonitis. Nevertheless, these findings by no means reduce the favorable outcomes of pembrolizumab in patients with lung cancer irrespective of concomitant ILD. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV-2) pandemic, combination treatment of pembrolizumab with other ICIs, was an independent risk factor for hospital admission, along with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scores ≥ 2 and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, but was not related to death. The risk of exposing NSCLC patients to SARS COV-2 has led to extensive interval doses with many ICIs, including pembrolizumab, with comparable PFS to standard dose but with minor frequency of pneumonitis.

ICI-induced pneumonitis is managed according to a grading system ranging from 1–4, with grades 3–4 requiring steroid treatment and hospitalization. Microbiological, cellular and molecular analysis of BALF of patients with confirmed pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis revealed a lymphocytic and interleukin-6 predominance, providing useful pathogenetic and therapeutic insights. Currently there are no biomarkers specific for ICIs-induced pneumonitis, although Krebs von den Lungen-6, which is produced by type II pneumocytes and airway epithelial cells in response to damage, has been effectively used to differentiate between immune-related pneumonitis and infection. Yet, further studies are needed to support its use in clinical practice.

### Success and failure of additional immune modulators in steroid-refractory / resistant pneumonitis related to immune checkpoint blockade [^111BF4Ff]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint blockade is a well-established treatment for a range of malignancies. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are generally well tolerated, they are associated with a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) which can affect any organ system. Severe irAEs are uncommon but can be fatal. Steroids are the most common initial treatment for most non-endocrine irAEs, but some patients are refractory or become resistant to steroids. When steroids are not effective, there are limited data to guide management, particularly in the context of pneumonitis.

Immune checkpoint pneumonitis occurs in approximately 5% of patients treated with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) blockade and perhaps higher rates in those treated with combination therapy. Steroid-refractory and chronic pneumonitis have been described in a small number of case reports and case series, often with high mortality rates. For patients in whom steroids are ineffective, treatment guidelines suggest several additional immune modulatory options including infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) and cyclophosphamide. Current use of these agents is largely extrapolated from experience with other irAEs and other inflammatory lung diseases and is subject to local expertise and practice patterns. Prospective comparative data are lacking and the exact role for these agents remains unclear.

We describe our single-center experience in the use of alternate immune modulators in addition to steroids in patients with steroid-refractory or -resistant ICI-related pneumonitis.

Pulmonary toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any pulmonary-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

Patients with pre-existing autoimmune ILD should be referred to a specialist where possible before initiation of ICI therapy for the consideration of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and risk assessment (LE: 3).
Patients with suspected pneumonitis should be examined via high-resolution CT of the chest. If the CT scan is negative, PFTs should be considered to identify a potential functional deficit (LE: 4).
If PFTs are indicated, they should include spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).
Patients experiencing grade 2 pneumonitis should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent), tapering over 4–6 weeks. For pneumonitis of grade ≥ 3, patients should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV or equivalent, tapering over 4–6 weeks (LE: 3).
If high-dose corticosteroid therapy does not improve pneumonitis symptoms within 72 hours (or if symptoms are life-threatening), options include (in no particular order) mycophenolate mofetil (1–1.5 g two times per day, tapering in consultation with a pulmonary specialist (LE: 3)), hdIVIG (2 g/kg in divided doses over 2–5 days, per institutional guidelines (LE: 4)), infliximab (5 mg/kg, one dose with optional repeat 14 days later (LE: 4)), cyclophosphamide (LE: 3), or tocilizumab (LE: 4).
If patients have experienced grade 2 pneumonitis, they may be re-challenged with ICIs upon complete resolution of symptoms. These patients should be monitored through more frequent consultations with their physician (LE: 4).

Drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) general management — pharmacovigilance plays an important role, and all drug-related adverse effects should be declared to the pharmacovigilance program; delayed diagnosis is associated with higher severity of lung injury and less reversibility resulting in residual lung damage, so early diagnosis and cessation of the offending drug intake promote optimal outcomes, while glucocorticoids are commonly administered to facilitate resolution of lung injury, particularly for those severely affected (National Cancer Institute grade 3–4 pneumonitis), who usually require hospitalization for initial treatment and monitoring; supportive measures including supplemental oxygen and noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilator support may be needed.

### Managing pulmonary toxicities associated with immunotherapy: a case discussion [^114vxrcX]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy has changed the field of oncology around the world with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for a number of tumor types over the last 5years. However, immune-mediated adverse events can be challenging and difficult to treat, with one of the most dire consequences being immune-mediated pneumonitis. KEY POINTS: Rapid intervention and aggressive management for grade 3 or greater pneumonitisSlow taper of steroids and also recommend pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxisMonitor carefully for a pneumonitis flare with steroid taper, which can occur in the absence of resuming anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [1], and do not resume anti-PD-1 therapy until completely off steroids and no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrenceConsider observation without anti-PD-1 resumption-in this case, durable response was maintained even without resuming anti-PD-1 therapy.

Implications for practice

Our study identified several pre-treatment risk factors for severe ICI-p. These factors can be utilized to identify patients at the highest risk of severe ICI-p before ICI treatment, allowing oncologists to weigh the risks of severe ICI-p with the benefits of cancer treatment. We also found several predictors of partially steroid-responsive and steroid-refractory ICI-p at the time of ICI-p diagnosis, allowing clinicians to target patients who would benefit the most from early and aggressive immune suppression.

### Treatment of the immune-related adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors: a review [^11227dBa]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has significantly improved the treatment of a variety of cancers and led to US Food and Drug Administration approvals for patients with a variety of malignant neoplasms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance antitumor immunity by blocking negative regulators of T-cell function that exist both on immune cells and on tumor cells. Although these agents can lead to remarkable responses, their use can also be associated with unique immune-related adverse effects (irAEs).

Observations

In general, use of PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab has a lower incidence of irAEs compared with those that block CTLA-4 such as ipilimumab. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has a higher rate of irAEs than either approach as monotherapy. Consensus guidelines regarding the treatment of the most common irAEs including rash, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and pneumonitis have been established. The mainstay of irAE treatment consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant agents such as infliximab; most irAEs will resolve with appropriate management.

Conclusions and Relevance

The clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is expanding rapidly. Oncology practitioners will therefore be required to recognize and manage irAEs in a growing patient population. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent patient morbidity and mortality, and adherence to established algorithms is recommended.

### Risk factors and immunomodulators use in steroid-refractory checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^115d9aQh]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is leading to a rapid increasement of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can involve in any organ or system and limit the use of these drugs. Among irAEs, checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is one of the most common adverse events and leads to an unexpectedly high mortality rate. Steroids are the dug of first choice for most irAEs recommended by current guidelines, including CIP, and are effective in most patients within 48–72 hours. Nonetheless, there are a subset of patients whose CIP do not respond well to steroids within 48–72 hours, or improve first but subsequent relapse without ICI rechallenge, which has been described as steroid-refractory CIP. The steroid-refractory CIP can be life-threatening, with the mortality rate from 34.6% to 75%. Otherwise, steroid-refractory CIP often persists and requires long-term therapy due to poor treatment response. On the one hand, persistent or recurrent pneumonitis can lead to an irreversible progression of fibrosis and a decrease of the pulmonary function, which impairs the quality of life significantly. On the other hand, long-term treatment with high-dose steroids improves the risk of steroid-related complication and makes nursing more difficult. For patients who recover from the disease, ICIs are tended to temporarily or permanently discontinued due to the remnant irreversible fibrosis and worries about relapse, which may be unfavorable to survival.

Conclusion

We found that pre-treatment chest imaging abnormalities, PFT abnormalities, and lower lymphocyte and eosinophil count at the time of ICI-p diagnosis may be associated with severe ICI-p. We also found that an initial corticosteroid dose of less than 1 mg/kg was associated with partially steroid-responsive ICI-p. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to validate our results.

Atezolizumab — mechanism and immune-mediated adverse event management in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is described as follows: Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that inhibits PD-L1, which improves antitumor immune response. Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, including atezolizumab, and for patients with immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on the severity of the reaction. Atezolizumab should also be permanently discontinued for patients with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when indicated. The following sections describe the use of atezolizumab in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC. Pseudoprogression has been reported; therefore, traditional RECIST criteria may not be applicable.

### Success and failure of additional immune modulators in steroid-refractory / resistant pneumonitis related to immune checkpoint blockade [^113ofenB]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With an ever-increasing number of patients with cancer eligible for immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the absolute burden of ICI-related pneumonitis will continue to increase, including patients in whom treatment with steroids is insufficient. Treatment guidelines provide lists of suggested additional immune modulators, however evidence for the use of these agents in steroid-refractory ICI pneumonitis and data to guide expectations for patients and providers is limited. Here, we describe the largest reported series of ICI pneumonitis patients treated with additional immune modulators along with steroids, with a majority of patients managed with TNF blockade. This experience enhances knowledge of clinical course, prognosis, and complications of therapy in these high-risk patients.

Overall, we observed generally poor response to treatment and significant morbidity and mortality. However, survival with durable pneumonitis improvement and without complication did occur in about a third of cases. We identified two clinical phenotypes of patients treated with additional immune modulators for ICI pneumonitis: primary steroid-refractory and steroid-resistant. Steroid-refractory patients had earlier onset, more severe pneumonitis, with less likelihood of durable response in comparison to resistant patients. Among patients categorized as steroid-refractory, there was heterogeneity in time between onset of pneumonitis and dosing of additional immune modulators (range up to 23 days). The time to initiation of additional immune modulator varied as did the clinical course of each patient, since the dynamic of this entity and response pattern to steroids is often individualized. It is possible that routine early use of additional immune modulators on an initial signal of refractory response could be a strategy for improving outcomes in the future.

Pulmonary toxicity — immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis — includes variable presentations, risk factors, and incidence. For the purposes of this manuscript, pneumonitis is defined broadly as lung tissue inflammation. Pneumonitis is a relatively common irAE that is associated with lower rates of patient survival; symptoms include dyspnea, persistent cough, chest pain, fever, and hypoxia (potentially leading to respiratory failure), though patients may also be asymptomatic with detectable inflammation on CT scan. In published meta-analyses, patients with NSCLC or renal cell carcinoma have a higher risk of developing pneumonitis compared with melanoma following PD-(L)1 inhibitors, and recent literature indicates that a history of asthma and/or smoking may predispose to higher grade pneumonitis; other factors include prior curative-intent radiotherapy and squamous tumor histology, and lack of improvement with corticosteroid treatment may be more common in former or active smokers or those with underlying lung conditions. Pneumonitis occurs in 4% of patients receiving PD-(L)1 inhibitors (1% grade ≥ 3) and 1% of patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 therapy (1% grade ≥ 3), with higher rates for combination ICIs at 7% (2% grade ≥ 3).

Pulmonary toxicity panel recommendations — evaluation and management of suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis should include high-resolution CT of the chest, with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) considered if the CT is negative and including spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Patients with pre-existing autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be referred to a specialist before ICI initiation for consideration of PFTs and risk assessment. Patients experiencing grade 2 pneumonitis should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent), tapering over 4–6 weeks, and for pneumonitis of grade ≥ 3, patients should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV or equivalent, tapering over 4–6 weeks. If high-dose corticosteroid therapy does not improve symptoms within 72 hours (or if symptoms are life-threatening), options include mycophenolate mofetil 1–1.5 g two times per day, hdIVIG 2 g/kg in divided doses over 2–5 days, infliximab 5 mg/kg one dose with optional repeat 14 days later, cyclophosphamide, or tocilizumab. If patients have experienced grade 2 pneumonitis, they may be re-challenged with ICIs upon complete resolution of symptoms and should be monitored through more frequent consultations with their physician.

Drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — when to stop the suspected offending drug: Discontinuation of the suspected drug is advisable for patients with severe or progressive lung disease (worsening to grade 2 or 3) when DRP is a possible or likely cause while diagnostic studies proceed; improvement after stopping the drug without glucocorticoids strongly supports DRP; conversely, it may be appropriate to closely monitor and continue therapy when injury is not severe or progressive, particularly with isolated radiologic changes (grade 1 pneumonitis).

Drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — glucocorticoid response does not confirm diagnosis: clinical improvement subsequent to glucocorticoid therapy does not definitively confirm the diagnosis of DRP, improvement may be coincidental due to a self-limited event, yet glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used in suspected DRP and response would support a diagnosis in the absence of a better alternative explanation, and improvement may obviate invasive diagnostic maneuvers such as bronchoscopic or surgical lung biopsy.

Recognition and management of irAEs

ICI toxicity

ICIs are associated with a distinct profile of toxicities compared with conventional cancer treatments. A number of guidelines exist on general principles concerning the diagnosis and management of irAEs, including from SITC, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. In addition to a CPGSITC has also published a guidebookto assist in the management of toxicity. Patients with lung cancer may be at increased risk for developing specific lung-related irAEs, which is why the recognition and management of these toxicities is critical before proceeding with an immunotherapy treatment plan. As described in SITC's guideline, ruling out other potential causes of pneumonitis is vitally important to safely manage irAEs in ICI-treated patients.

While most irAEs occur during or shortly after the period of treatment, they may also occur months after treatment has concluded. Two analyses of ICI-treated patients who developed pneumonitis found similar median times to onset, at 2.8 months (multiple tumor types)and 82 days (patients with NSCLC).

A particular concern when administering ICIs to patients with lung cancer is an increased incidence of pneumonitis, a potentially serious irAE that is associated with lower survival in patients who receive immunotherapy for lung cancer. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of anti-PD-1 ICIs found that patients with NSCLC developed pneumonitis at a higher rate than patients with melanoma, both for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs 1.6%; p = 0.002) and for grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis (1.8% vs 0.2%; p < 0.001). This analysis also found that combination therapies that included ICIs also carried a significantly higher risk of pneumonitis compared with ICI monotherapy, with higher odds for all-grade (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.50; p < 0.001) and grade ≥ 3 (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.35; p < 0.001) pneumonitis. Additional risk factors for ICI-induced pneumonitis include prior radiotherapy (curative-intent, chest)and squamous histology (as compared with adenocarcinoma histology) for patients with NSCLC, and pneumonitis that does not respond to corticosteroid treatment may be more common in patients with a history of other lung conditions or smoking.

### Pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph (Keytruda QLEX) [^115qyRvH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. In general, if KEYTRUDA QLEX requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 5% (13/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including fatal (0.4%), Grade 3 (2%), and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions.

Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 1.3% (36) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

### Open-label, single-arm phase II study of pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^1137dU7b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, KEYNOTE-427 is the first study to date to evaluate the clinical utility of a single-agent PD-1 inhibitor in a large cohort of previously untreated patients with advanced ccRCC. In this single-arm phase II trial, pembrolizumab monotherapy showed promising antitumor activity in the overall population (ORR, 36.4%; CR, 3.6%; PR, 32.7%) and across key subgroups that included all IMDC risk groups, and in patients with tumors with high and low PD-L1 status, and patients with tumors with sarcomatoid differentiation. Fifteen of 40 responding patients experienced ongoing responses at data cutoff. The median DOR was 18.9 months and 64.0% of responders maintained their response for at least 12 months, and the 24-month OS rate was 70.8%. Taken together, these results show that pembrolizumab monotherapy has durable antitumor activity in untreated patients with advanced ccRCC.

The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the current study is comparable to the previously observed safety profiles of pembrolizumab in other tumor types. Commonly reported grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy were colitis (6.4%) and diarrhea (3.6%), and 17 (15.5%) patients discontinued treatment because of treatment-related AEs. One patient died of treatment-related pneumonitis. Immune-mediated AEs, including hypothyroidism, colitis, rash, and pneumonitis, have been reported to occur with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Guidelines for managing immune-related AEs recommend corticosteroid treatment for grade 2–4 events, holding immunotherapy until grade 2/3 events return to grade 1, and discontinuing immunotherapy for grade 4 events. In the current study, 28 of 54 immune-related AE episodes required concomitant corticosteroid use with a high starting dose (≥ 40 mg/d prednisone or equivalent) being chosen to manage 24 of the events.

### Steroid-refractory PD-(L) 1 pneumonitis: incidence, clinical features, treatment, and outcomes [^114V2D1p]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune-checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (ICI-pneumonitis) is the most frequently fatal toxicity from PD-(L)1 (PD-(L)1: programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death ligand-1) monotherapies. ICI-pneumonitis typically develops within the first 3 months (range: 9 days to 19 months) of ICI initiation, clinically improve with corticosteroids therapy within 48–72 hours, and require a median of 12 weeks to taper off corticosteroids completely. However, a subset of patients with ICI-pneumonitis do not clinically improve with corticosteroids alone and require further immunosuppression. This phenomenon, termed steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis, is defined as a lack of clinical improvement in ICI-pneumonitis after 48 hours to 2 weeks of corticosteroid treatment. However, the clinical and radiographic features of steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis are poorly understood and limited to individual cases and small case series. Additionally, patients who develop steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis almost universally succumb to this toxicity or the infectious complications of immunosuppressive management.

Published guidelines recommend a variety of potential treatments for steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis including infliximab, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate mofetil. However, the data supporting these choices are based largely on their use in other steroid-refractory irAEs. Infliximab, a TNF (Tumor-necrosis factor)-alpha inhibitor, has been used successfully to treat steroid-refractory ICI-colitis. IVIG is an admixture of antibodies from human sera that produces an immunomodulatory effectand has resulted in clinical improvements for patients with ICI-myasthenia gravis and ICI-thrombocytopenia. Thus, the optimum choice of immunosuppressive therapy for patients who develop steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis has yet to be established.

Given these gaps in our knowledge, we provide the first comprehensive report of the incidence, features, management, and outcomes of patients with steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis at a single, high-volume academic institution.

### Cyclosporine successfully treats steroid-resistant checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis: a case report [^116V7o6D]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by utilizing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. However, ICI-based treatment accompanied severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) to which almost all organ systems are susceptible, especially checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP). In real-world studies, the incidence of CIP can be as high as 10–19%, and severe cases, especially grade ≥ 3 cases can be fatal. Previous studies have revealed that CIP may occur more frequently and have a faster onset in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to other types of cancers. Further, with the increasing application of ICI treatment, the incidence and mortality of CIP may increase. Major guidelines and expert consensus reports recommend that the first treatment for CIP is still corticosteroids. However, only 70–80% of patients with CIP respond to conventional corticosteroids, and the remaining patients are refractory or become resistant to steroids. Treatment options for these patients are extremely limited, with only limited evidence suggesting the potential efficacy of drugs such as infliximab, and nintedanib, to name a few.

Cyclosporine A, a calcineurin inhibitor, is a potent non-cytotoxic immunosuppressive agent that has been widely used in interstitial lung disease associated with autoimmune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Given that CIP is an immune-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) that may have overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms with other ILDs, it is possible that such patients can benefit from cyclosporine-based treatment methods.

Herein, we report a case of a patient with NSCLC who developed severe CIP after receiving pembrolizumab. The patient was hospitalized four times repeatedly due to steroid-resistant CIP, and the patient's condition was ultimately controlled with a combination of cyclosporine and low-dose corticosteroid treatment. We further investigated the potential relationship between steroid-resistant CIP in order to provide new treatment options for CIP.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115rqQBv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–pneumonitis diagnostic evaluation — Clinical symptoms are nonspecific and include dyspnea, cough, low oxygen saturation, fever, and rarely chest pain, with onset varying from weeks to many months after initiation of therapy. Varying radiographic patterns may be categorized according to interstitial pneumonia classifications, but accurate radiologic diagnosis and correlation with pathology can be challenging and require close interpretation and communication among radiologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, and infectious disease specialists. Pulmonary infections, particularly opportunistic infections in those receiving corticosteroids, infliximab, and/or other treatments for irAEs, have been reported; similarities with ICI-pneumonitis can complicate evaluation and result in harm if infection is undiagnosed before immunosuppression. Empiric antibiotics for suspected infection might have unintended consequences, including reduced clinical benefit from ICIs, possibly due to alterations in the gut microbiome. Diagnostic evaluations such as bronchoscopy and/or biopsy have been suggested but are variably performed owing to inconsistent availability, unfamiliarity with immune-related toxicity, and lack of multidisciplinary collaborations, and the precise role of bronchoscopy and the diagnostic value of BAL and/or biopsy have not yet been established. Expert opinion guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology, Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, and ASCO/NCCN include imaging (chest X-ray and/or CT), pulse oximetry, and an infectious work-up (including nasal swab, sputum, blood, and urine cultures), but there is not clear evidence that these evaluations differentiate ICI-pneumonitis from infection. Chest X-ray likely lacks sensitivity in diagnosing ICI-pneumonitis. It is difficult to determine the significance of clinical severity assessments in those with preexisting chronic pulmonary diseases, and the role of pretreatment measures such as PFTs, pulse oximetry, and 6MWT is unexplored.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis following discontinuation of pembrolizumab in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma: a case report and literature review [^115a2DFP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) is a rare but serious complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While it typically occurs within the first few months of treatment, its onset after ICI discontinuation is relatively uncommon. This report presents a case of CIP occurring 2.5 months after cessation of pembrolizumab and reviews the existing literature on CIP after discontinuation of ICIs.

Case Presentation

A 77-year-old female with stage IV right lung adenocarcinoma (T4N2M1a) developed pneumonitis 2.5 months after discontinuation of pembrolizumab (following 26 months of initial treatment). Initially suspected as community-acquired pneumonia, the patient received antiviral and antibiotic therapy with progressive deterioration. Microbiological investigations yielded negative results, and consultation suggested lung cancer recurrence. PET-CT revealed heightened metabolic activity in the lungs. Percutaneous lung biopsy demonstrated organizing pneumonia, and NGS testing of biopsy tissue showed no pathogenic organisms. Combined with CT findings and the patient's history of pembrolizumab use, the diagnosis of checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) was established. Short-term steroid therapy resulted in significant improvement.

Conclusions

Integration of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and medication history is crucial for diagnosis. This case underscores the need for vigilance for CIP even after discontinuing ICI therapy. Although this report provides insights into CIP after discontinuation based on a single case and a literature review, further studies involving larger cohorts are warranted to better understand the post-treatment risk of CIP.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^115hePzK]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pneumonitis following improvement of symptoms has been observed both in patients who were re-challenged with ICI therapy and in patients who were not, demonstrating the need for careful monitoring of all patients with ICI-induced pneumonitis after resolution of symptoms. In a small sample of patients who were re-challenged with ICI therapy following complete clinical resolution of pneumonitis (n = 12), 25% developed recurrent pneumonitis that resolved by reinstating the same initial intervention: withholding of ICIs (grade 1) and/or corticosteroid treatment (grade 2). In recent studies, pneumonitis has also been found to assume a chronic course in approximately 2% of patients with NSCLC or melanoma treated with ICIs. Patients with steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis may benefit from mycophenolate mofetil or high-dose IVIG (hdIVIG), although this has only been reported in case studies. Based on its application in other immune-mediated lung diseases, cyclophosphamide might also be expected to provide benefit in steroid-refractory pneumonitis. However, little data exist that directly tests the use of cyclophosphamide in this treatment context. One study of 120 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) found that those who were able to tolerate a full course of infusions with cyclophosphamide (6 infusions at 600 mg/m 2) appeared to stabilize in their decline in lung function. Other approaches that have been reported include anti-cytokine agents. Infliximab (5 mg/kg, IV) has been used to treat patients with ICI-induced pneumonitis, with mixed results from a number of case reports. A study of the IL-6R antagonist antibody tocilizumab (4 mg/kg, IV) for the treatment of nivolumab-associated irAEs also showed potential benefit in the setting of grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis. An ongoing prospective study through ECOG-ACRIN will compare the efficacy of IVIG versus infliximab for steroid-refractory pneumonitis (NCT04438382).

### Cyclosporine successfully treats steroid-resistant checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis: a case report [^114kkKnX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this work, we present a case of a recurrent steroid-resistant CIP patient treated with pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The patient failed to achieve stable control with corticosteroids and experienced a relapse of CIP during the fourth steroid treatment tapering period. In an exploratory approach, we administered a combination of cyclosporine and corticosteroids, rapidly tapering the corticosteroid dose during the treatment process. There were no signs of CIP relapse, and the tumor remained stable during the six-month follow-up. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent that specifically targets T lymphocytes, and is frequently utilized in clinical settings to prevent graft rejection in liver, kidney, and heart transplantation. Additionally, it can be combined with steroids to treat immune-related disorders. To our knowledge, cyclosporine has not been previously used to treat pneumonitis associated with ICIs.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) 2020 clinical practice recommendations for the management of immune-related adverse events: pulmonary toxicity [^111v7NLG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The immune checkpoints associated with the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways are critical modulators of immune activation. These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury. Management principles for ICI-related lung injury, including current consensus on steroid refractory pneumonitis and the use of other immune modulating agents in this setting are also highlighted.

### Corticosteroid-resistant immune-related adverse events: a systematic review [^116kWmcs]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pneumonitis following a first episode of immune-related pneumonitis is frequent (25% of patients), both spontaneously and in patients who had rechallenge to ICIs (recurrent pneumonitis in 25–43% of patients). A minority of patients (14% of patients) with pneumonitis may develop chronic low grade pneumonitis, which persists despite ICI-discontinuation and may not resolve after 3 months of corticosteroids.

Management

Consensus guidelines

Guidelines (ESMO, ASCO, SITC, NCCN) essentially agree on two recommendations concerning the management of grade 2 or higher immune-related pneumonitis: discontinuation of ICI-treatment and start of immunosuppressive (high-dose) corticosteroid-treatment. There are no consistent recommendations regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic management of steroid-resistant pneumonitis. Guideline recommendations are summarized in table 3. There is consensus that in the case of higher-grade pneumonitis and/or steroid-resistance, differential diagnoses must be excluded (infection, embolism, effusion, tumor progression/carcinomatosis, or cardiac cause). If not done during the initial workup, diagnostic steps should therefore include high-resolution chest CT, bronchoalveolar lavage and consultation with a specialist. Transbronchial lesion biopsy can be considered on an individual basis.

Table 3
Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for steroid-resistant pneumonitis

According to all guidelines, failure of corticosteroid treatment is defined as lack of improvement within 48–72 hours and should prompt immediate treatment escalation. Steroid-resistant grade 2 pneumonitis should be treated as grade 3 with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Additional immunosuppressive treatment options include MMF, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and infliximab.

Literature review

We have performed a structured literature search and have gathered data about treatment of steroid-resistant immune-related pneumonitis (see online supplemental table 7). Seventeen publications have been identified, nine of which are single-case reports. Signs of efficacy to treat steroid-resistant immune-related pneumonitis have been reported for different immunosuppressive agents, including IVIG, MMF, cyclophosphamide, tocilizumab and infliximab. However, there is no prospective or comparative data in this situation and there are no treatment recommendations favoring one agent over another. There is a small number of retrospective analyses of patients with pneumonitis that include patients with steroid-resistant pneumonitis. Common to each of these reports is a high fatality rate of 67–100% for patients with steroid-resistant pneumonitis, regardless which additional suppressive line treatment was chosen.

### Investigating risk factors and treatment options for severe, partially steroid responsive, and steroid-refractory checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^115QGgGB]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

While pre-treatment chest and PFT abnormalities are relatively well established as potential risk factors for ICI-p, the association with serologic biomarkers is not clear. Zhou et al found that lower albumin levels were associated with the development of ICI-p, and Chu et al showed that higher pre-treatment peripheral eosinophilia was associated with ICI-p and better overall survival. Neither examined whether these or other serologic markers were predictive for severe ICI-p. We found that lower albumin level, lower absolute lymphocyte count, and lower absolute eosinophil count at the time of ICI-p diagnosis were associated with severe ICI-p. Serum albumin may be difficult to utilize prognostically for severe ICI-p as low levels have been correlated with lower survival in cancer patients treated with ICI, but higher absolute eosinophil counts have been linked to steroid-responsive pulmonary diseases, which typically have a better prognosis compared to non-eosinophilic interstitial lung diseases. We found that patients with higher eosinophil count at ICI-p diagnosis had more mild disease compared to those with lower eosinophil counts, which may reflect a better response to initial corticosteroid treatment preventing the development of severe ICI-p. Further studies will be needed to validate our findings by using albumin, lymphocyte count, and eosinophil count as potential biomarkers for severe ICI-p.

Corticosteroids are a mainstay in ICI-p treatment, but the dosing of steroids and its impact on the disease course for ICI-p is unknown. Major societies all recommend treatment with steroids at a dose of at least 1 mg/kg (prednisone equivalent) as first-line therapy. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion, extrapolated from other ICI toxicities, and not based on evidence showing superiority of corticosteroid dosing being at least 1 mg/kg. Furthermore, previous literature on drug-related pneumonitis suggested initial corticosteroid dosing at 1 mg/kg but only up to a maximum of 60 mg daily. Although utilized frequently, corticosteroids at high doses are not harmless and can increase the risk of opportunistic infections, exacerbate other chronic illnesses, and decrease quality of life. In our study, we are the first to show that patients who received less than 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent of steroids, despite a median dose of 60 mg of prednisone, were more likely to need an increase or repeated steroid course, additional immune suppression, or have incompletely resolved ICI-p compared to those who received at least 1 mg/kg corticosteroid as initial therapy, suggesting this dose is necessary to prevent partially steroid responsive or refractory ICI-p.

### Real-world insights on preferred treatments for steroid-refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis [^1178CY3c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Balaji et al describe the clinical management and disease course of 12 patients with primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis (defined by the authors as lack of clinical improvement after at least 48 hours and up to 14 days of high-dose corticosteroids). The identified patients were referred to the multidisciplinary immune-related toxicity team or pulmonary outpatient clinic with ICI-induced pneumonitis. In this study, primary steroid refractoriness occurred after a median of 5 doses of ICI, resulting in grade 2 (n = 3) and grade 3 (n = 9) symptomatic pneumonitis. The most commonly identified radiographic pattern was diffuse alveolar damage. The mean dose of steroids administered was prednisone equivalent 75 mg/day prior to receiving additional immunosuppressive therapy. Clinical management included treatment with IVIG (n = 7; started a mean of 17 days after steroid initiation), infliximab (n = 2; started 7 and 8 days after steroid initiation), and combination IVIG + infliximab (n = 3; infliximab added to IVIG on days 8, 9, and 15). Almost all patients with primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis required management in the intensive care unit; around half required mechanical ventilation. The authors report that 75% of patients in this study died of steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis or infectious complications, including all five patients treated with infliximab (two as monotherapy, three in combination with IVIG).

### Real-world insights on preferred treatments for steroid-refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis [^1178vxhP]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Beattie et al describe the clinical course of 26 patients who had either primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis (n = 12; defined as no improvement or worsening of pneumonitis with initial high-dose steroid monotherapy) or steroid-resistant ICI-induced pneumonitis (n = 14; defined as initial response to steroid with subsequent recurrence of pneumonitis during steroid tapering in the absence of ICI rechallenge). The authors searched for administration of immunomodulatory agents and evaluated the clinical management and course for patients who clinically and/or pathologically had ICI-induced pneumonitis. All patients with primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis were treated with at least 60 mg of prednisone equivalent. Median time to addition of an immunomodulator for primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis was 7 days, and median time to additional treatment for steroid-resistant pneumonitis during steroid taper was 2.9 months. The study reported more severe disease in patients with primary steroid-refractory ICI-induced pneumonitis (grade 2 = 1, grade 3, n = 9; grade 4, n = 2) than in patients with resistant pneumonitis (grade 2, n = 10; grade 3, n = 4; grade 4, n = 0). Most of the retrospective study included patients treated with infliximab monotherapy (n = 15; 58%), mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy (n = 5; 19%) or infliximab comination therapy (n = 5; 19%). However, further investigation into the subgroups shows that all patients with primary steroid-refractory pneumonitis (n = 12) received infliximab as monotherapy or in combination with mycophenolate, and most patients with recurrent pneumonitis received infliximab, and/or mycophenolate. Of the 26 patients identified, more than half (62%) were hospitalized and, despite aggressive treatment, only 10 had a durable improvement following additional immunosuppression plus steroids. However, when focusing on the primary steroid-refractory patients, only 3/12 (25%) had durable desponses to combination immunosuppression and all 12 patients died with cause of death attritbued to pneumonitis or infectious complications in half of these patients (See supplemental table 3).

### Immunotherapy-induced pulmonary toxicity: a comprehensive radiological review [^1176FCif]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The expanding clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across oncologic therapeutics has revealed a spectrum of pulmonary toxicities, with reported incidence rates ranging from 2% to 19% depending on the therapeutic regimen. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the cornerstone for diagnostic evaluation, reliably identifying characteristic radiographic patterns such as organizing pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reactions, and diffuse alveolar damage. The diagnostic challenge lies in distinguishing these immune-mediated pulmonary injuries from infectious etiologies, radiation-induced lung injury, and neoplastic progression, each requiring distinct therapeutic interventions. Contemporary management protocols employ glucocorticoid therapy dosed according to toxicity severity, while investigational approaches explore targeted immunomodulators. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding radiographic manifestations, diagnostic pathways, and therapeutic algorithms, offering radiologists a structured approach to evaluating ICI-associated pulmonary complications. We highlight recent advances, including quantitative CT analysis and serum biomarkers, that promise to refine early detection and risk stratification.

Pneumonitis definitions

Pneumonitis severity was assigned based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4), with severe disease defined as grade 3 or higher. Pneumonitis resolution was defined as improvement in patient symptoms, resolved inflammatory changes on chest imaging, and a decrease in systemic steroids to less than or equal to the equivalent of 10 milligrams (mg) of prednisone, consistent with society recommendations for resolution of IRAE. Steroid refractory pneumonitis was defined as clinical worsening of pneumonitis after a minimum of 48 hours of high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day or more) or no clinical improvement after at least 14 days of high-dose corticosteroids. Steroid-responsive pneumonitis was defined as ICI-p that resulted in complete pneumonitis resolution without an increase or recurrent corticosteroid dose during or following initial treatment, while partially steroid-responsive pneumonitis was defined as ICI-p requiring repeated or increases in corticosteroid courses due to lack of pneumonitis resolution or those that died without documented resolution of ICI-p (includes death for cancer progression, change in code status, or from pneumonitis).

Evaluation of pre-treatment pulmonary function tests

Spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV1/FVC ratio, bronchodilator responsiveness testing), total lung volume (TLC), residual volume (RV), diffusion capacity (DLCO), diffusion capacity corrected for hemoglobin (DLCO corrected for hemoglobin), 6-minute walk test, and oxygen requirement within 12 months of ICI initiation were recorded by the study team and served as the baseline lung function. Testing that did not meet ATS criteria for acceptability and repeatability was not included.PFTs closest to the start of ICI diagnosis and treatment were considered. All values were recorded as raw values (liters for FEV1, FVC, TLC, RV, mmol/min/mmHg for DLCO and DLCO corrected for hemoglobin) or as a percent predicted (pp) adjusted for patient's sex, height, age, and race. When available, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC was utilized to determine the presence of obstructive disease.

### Immune checkpoint immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: benefits and pulmonary toxicities [^115yvTre]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are newer, immunotherapy-based drugs that have been shown to improve survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic agents, ICIs work by boosting the body's natural tumor killing response. However, this unique mechanism of action has also led to the recognition of class-specific side effects. Labeled immune-related adverse events, these toxicities can affect multiple organ systems including the lungs. Immune-mediated lung injury because of ICI use, termed checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), occurs in about 3% to 5% of patients receiving ICIs; however, the real-world incidence of this entity may be higher, especially now that ICIs are being used in nonclinical trial settings. In this review, we briefly introduce the biology of ICIs and the indications for ICI use in NSCLC and then discuss the epidemiology and clinical and radiologic manifestations of CIP. Next, we discuss management strategies for CIP, including the current consensus on management of steroid-refractory CIP. Given the nascent nature of this field, we highlight areas of uncertainty and emerging research questions in the burgeoning field of checkpoint inhibitor pulmonary toxicity.

Immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, may occur with nivolumab plus ipilimumab; intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on the severity of the reaction for patients with immune-mediated adverse events. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab should be discontinued for patients with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when indicated; ipilimumab can also cause immune-mediated adverse events such as hepatitis and endocrinopathies.

Patient demographics and presentation

Of the 78 patients (48 males; median age 64, (range 28–81)), there were 39 with lung cancer, 21 with melanoma, 1 with lung cancer and melanoma, 7 with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 10 with other malignancies. Thirty-eight patients had at least one pulmonary comorbidity, 34 of which had COPD and 60 patients were either current or former smokers (table 1). Most patients presented with shortness of breath (81%) with some also experiencing cough (49%) and fewer with fever (18%), chest pain (13%) and fatigue (12%). There were 46 patients who developed signs or symptoms of pneumonitis > 60 days from ICI initiation.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

Regarding treatment, there was variability in steroid dosing with 75 (96%) patients receiving steroids on initial presentation, of which 25% received IV steroids. For those who had recurrent or persistent pneumonitis, 25 (93%) patients received steroids, of which 28% received IV steroids. Intravenous methylprednisolone doses ranged from 60 mg to 200 mg total daily. Prednisone doses ranged from 40 mg to 120 mg total daily with taper plans typically lasting 4–6 weeks. Taper plans were as short as 2 weeks and as prolonged as 6 months.

### Chronic immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^116BN1qJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonitis from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a potentially fatal immune-related adverse event (irAE) from antiprogrammed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 immunotherapy. Most cases of ICI pneumonitis improve or resolve with 4–6 weeks of corticosteroid therapy. Herein, we report the incidence, clinicopathological features and management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis that warrants ≥ 12 weeks of immunosuppression.

Methods

Patients with ICI pneumonitis were identified from institutional databases of ICI-treated patients with advanced melanoma and NSCLC between January 2011 and July 2018. ICI pneumonitis was defined as clinical/radiographic evidence of lung inflammation without alternative diagnoses, adjudicated by a multidisciplinary team. Chronic ICI pneumonitis was defined as pneumonitis that persists or worsens with steroid tapering, and necessitates ≥ 12 weeks of immunosuppression, after ICI discontinuation. Serial chest CT was used to assess radiological features, and tumor response by Response EvaluationCriteria for Solid Tumors V.1.1. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were assessed by cell differential. Lung biopsy samples were evaluated by H&E staining and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), where available.

Results

Among 299 patients, 44 developed ICI pneumonitis (NSCLC: 5/205; melanoma: 1/94), and of these, 6 experienced chronic ICI pneumonitis. The overall incidence of chronic ICI pneumonitis was thus 2%. Of those who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis: the majority had NSCLC (5/6), all sustained disease control from ICIs, and none had other concurrent irAEs. Timing of chronic ICI pneumonitis development was variable (range: 0–50 months), and occurred at a median of 12 months post ICI start. Recrudescence of ICI pneumonitis occurred at a median of 6 weeks after initial steroid start (range: 3–12 weeks), with all patients requiring steroid reintroduction when tapered to ≤ 10 mg prednisone/equivalent. The median total duration of steroids was 37 weeks (range: 16–43+weeks). Re-emergence of radiographic ICI pneumonitis occurred in the same locations on chest CT, in most cases (5/6). All patients who developed chronic ICI pneumonitis had BALF lymphocytosis on cell differential and organising pneumonia on lung biopsy at initial ICI pneumonitis presentation, with persistent BALF lymphocytosis and brisk CD8+ infiltration on mIF at pneumonitis re-emergence during steroid taper.

Conclusions

A subset of patients who develop pneumonitis from ICIs will develop chronic ICI pneumonitis, that warrants long-term immunosuppression of ≥ 12 weeks, and has distinct clinicopathological features.

Abstract

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer care with incredible reductions in mortality. One of the most devastating complications of treatment is ICI-related pneumonitis (ICI-p). Despite this, little is known regarding risk factors for severe pneumonitis and treatment effectiveness of various therapeutic options for steroid-refractory disease. To address this, we conducted a retrospective study on patients with cancer who developed ICI-p.

Methods

We examined consecutive patients who received ICIs and developed ICI-p. Risk factors of interest for severe disease and steroid-refractory ICI-p, including pre-treatment pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and chest imaging, were compared between patients with severe (grades 3–5) and mild (grades 1–2) pneumonitis. The clinical and treatment courses for patients with steroid-refractory ICI-p were recorded.

Results

A total of 132 patients developed ICI-p, with 60 patients having mild and 72 with severe disease. We found that lower forced vital capacity percent predicted (66.24 vs 85.05, P = 0.05), lower total lung capacity percent predicted (85.23 vs 99.71, P = 0.13), and specific radiographic patterns on pre-treatment chest imaging were predictors of severe disease. Initial corticosteroid dose of less than 1 milligram per kilogram prednisone equivalent (P = 0.14) was correlated with partially steroid-responsive or steroid-refractory ICI-p. Ten patients had steroid refractory ICI-p, and those who received IVIG alone as the immune suppressant beyond corticosteroids had improved survival (P = 05).

Conclusions

We are the first to identify pre-treatment PFTs and chest imaging abnormalities as risk factors for severe ICI-p. We also found that lower corticosteroid doses were associated with partially steroid-responsive and steroid-refractory ICI-p. Larger, prospective studies are needed to validate our results.

HRCT, high-resolution computed tomography; ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor; i.v. intravenous; p.o. per os (oral administration)

The ten patients who did not undergo bronchoscopy consisted of seven with adenocarcinoma, two with squamous cell carcinoma, and one with NSCLC that was non-specific. The mean age of the ten patients was 64.8 ± 15.8 years, which included six men and four women. ICI treatment at admission included nivolumab and pembrolizumab for seven and three patients, respectively; the ICIs were used as a single-agent regimen. The grade of pneumonitis at admission was 1 in three patients, 2 in four, 3 in one, and 4 in two patients. Corticosteroid treatment for ICI-related pneumonitis was provided to nine of the ten patients, whereas one did not receive any treatment. Abnormal shadows on chest HRCTs due to ICI-related pneumonitis improved or disappeared in eight patients. However, two patients died of respiratory failure 3 and 31 days after admission, respectively, despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy; both patients suffered from grade 4 pneumonitis at admission.

### Cyclosporine successfully treats steroid-resistant checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis: a case report [^11288Mon]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) stands out as a particularly severe adverse event caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors, with a substantial real-world incidence ranging from 13 to 19%. While systemic corticosteroids represent the standard treatment for CIP, therapeutic options become limited in cases where patients do not respond to corticosteroid therapy. Such patients are classified as having steroid-resistant CIP, often associated with a poor prognosis. This case study provides insight into the symptoms, diagnostic process, and treatment approach for steroid-resistant CIP. Notably, successful management is demonstrated through the utilization of cyclosporine, highlighting its potential mechanisms of action in effectively treating steroid-resistant CIP.

Case description

We present the case of a 53-year-old male with stage IV. A non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who experienced elevated fever, cough, and dyspnea subsequent to immunotherapy treatment. Based on his medical history, clinical manifestations, and radiological findings, the patient was diagnosed with CIP. Initial administration of led to improvement, but during the subsequent tapering of corticosteroid therapy, a resurgence of CIP occurred, resulting in respiratory failure. Consequently, we arrived at the diagnosis of steroid-resistant CIP, prompting the implementation of a combination therapy with cyclosporine and corticosteroids to establish stable disease control. Upon systematic reduction of corticosteroid dosage, the patient maintained a favorable response with no recurrence.

Conclusions

This marks the first instance of effectively managing steroid-resistant CIP through the combined use of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Presently, cases of steroid-resistant CIP remain infrequent, necessitating vigilant and meticulous monitoring within clinical settings. Notably, there exists no distinct guideline specifying a singular agent for rescuing patients unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, cyclosporine emerges as a promising and efficacious treatment alternative for individuals unresponsive to corticosteroid intervention in the context of CIP.

### Success and failure of additional immune modulators in steroid-refractory / resistant pneumonitis related to immune checkpoint blockade [^117QtwQt]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonitis related to immune checkpoint blockade is uncommon but can be severe, fatal or chronic. Steroids are first-line treatment, however, some patients are refractory or become resistant to steroids. Like many immune-related adverse events, little is known regarding the outcomes and optimal management of patients in whom steroids are ineffective.

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study at a high-volume tertiary cancer center to evaluate the clinical course, management strategies and outcomes of patients treated for immune checkpoint pneumonitis with immune modulatory medications in addition to systemic steroids. Pharmacy records were queried for patients treated with both immune checkpoint blockade and receipt of additional immune modulators. Records were then manually reviewed to identify patients who received the additional immune modulators for immune checkpoint pneumonitis.

Results

From 2013 to 2020, we identified 26 patients treated for immune checkpoint pneumonitis with additional immune modulators in addition to steroids. Twelve patients (46%) were steroid-refractory and 14 (54%) were steroid-resistant. Pneumonitis severity included grade 2 (42%) or grade 3–4 (58%). Additional immune modulation consisted of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor (77%) and/or mycophenolate (23%). Durable improvement in pneumonitis following initiation of additional immune modulators occurred in 10 patients (38%), including three patients (12%) in whom pneumonitis resolved and all immunosuppressants ceased. The rate of 90-day all-cause mortality/hospice referral was 50%. At last follow-up, mortality attributable to pneumonitis was 23%. In addition to mortality from pneumonitis and cancer, 3 patients (12%) died due to infections possibly associated with immunosuppression.

Conclusions

Steroid-refractory or -resistant immune checkpoint pneumonitis is uncommon but associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additional immunomodulators can yield durable improvement, attained in over one third of patients. An improved understanding of the underlying biology of immune-related pneumonitis will be crucial to guide more precise and effective treatment strategies in the future.

Steroid therapy and additional immunosuppression

Following diagnosis of ICI pneumonitis based on clinical, radiological (and pathological, when available) grounds, all patients were initiated on steroid treatment. As shown in online supplementary table 3, the initial steroid dosing was between 60 mg and 120 mg of prednisone (or equivalent). However, unlike typical cases of ICI pneumonitis, the median total duration of steroids in these six cases of chronic ICI pneumonitis was 37 weeks (rang: 16–43+ weeks). This is because radiographic and clinical evidence of ICI pneumonitis recrudesced when steroids were tapered to 10 mg or less, and necessitated reinitiation of steroids followed by prolonged tapers in all six cases. Temporal changes in steroid dosing at the patient level and overall are outlined in online supplementary figure 3. In three out of six patients, ongoing steroid requirement necessitated initiation of second-line ICI pneumonitis therapy (either mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab or intravenous immunoglobulin; table 1).

### Success and failure of additional immune modulators in steroid-refractory / resistant pneumonitis related to immune checkpoint blockade [^116J8UUi]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

After institutional review board approval, all patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center treated with ICIs from 2013 through February 2020 were queried for receipt of a non-steroid immune modulator (eg, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, intravenous IG; online supplemental table S1). A query was also performed for pneumonitis in all patients exposed to ICIs. Records of patients who received ICIs as well as an additional immune modulator were manually reviewed to identify patients who received such therapy, in addition to systemic steroids, for management of pneumonitis which appeared to be related to ICI. Patients with a clear alternative etiology for their respiratory illness including malignant lung infiltration, active infection, alternate systemic pneumotoxic agent or radiation pneumonitis, were excluded. For all patients, the following data were collected retrospectively: patient demographics, prior and/or concomitant oncological therapy, clinical features of pneumonitis and pneumonitis treatments. Common terminology criteria for adverse events V.5.0 was used to grade severity of pneumonitis.

Patients were classified in to two subgroups based on the indication for additional immune modulator: (1) 'steroid-refractory' — patients with no improvement or worsening of pneumonitis with initial treatment with systemic steroids; (2) 'steroid-resistant' — patients who initially responded to steroids but subsequently developed recurrent pneumonitis in the context of steroid tapering, in the absence of immune checkpoint rechallenge.

For the assessment of pneumonitis disease course, pneumonitis improvement was defined as existence of a preponderance of evidence in the medical record (dates of disease course, notes, vital signs, oxygen requirement, level of care, laboratory values, medication changes and radiological information when available) that the patient was steadily improving toward recovery from pneumonitis. We stratified pneumonitis course into ad hoc clinical categories as follows: (1) durable improvement, with follow-up of 8 weeks or more past initial dosing of additional immune modulator; (2) transient improvement: initial benefit followed by pneumonitis relapse or inadequate follow-up — for example, unrelated cause of death, referral to hospice; or (3) no improvement. We also defined pneumonitis resolution as cessation of all immune modulators including steroids with sustained resolution of pneumonitis on imaging for 8 weeks or more.

### Pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph (Keytruda QLEX) [^112TQVXR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a clinical study enrolling 580 adult patients with resected NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091) who received intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent for adjuvant treatment, pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted intravenous pembrolizumab, 63% discontinued intravenous pembrolizumab, and 71% had resolution.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.2% (3/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 3 (0.8%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions.

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^1175xJtP]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been no prospective trial for treatment of immune-related pneumonitis (irP) occurred after immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

Methods

In this single-arm phase II study, patients with cancer with grade ≥ 2irP received oral prednisolone (1mg/kg/day), tapered over 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was a pneumonitis control rate at 6 weeks from the start of the study treatment, defined as complete disappearance or partial improvement of irP in high-resolution CT of the chest.

Results

Among 57 patients enrolled, 56 were included in the final analysis. The most frequent cause of irP was single ICI therapy (51.8%), followed by combination with chemotherapy plus ICI (39.3%). Thirty-five (62.5%) patients had grade 2 irP and 21 (37.5%) had grade ≥ 3. Fifty-one (91.1%) patients completed the study treatment while 5 discontinued the study treatment because of relapse of irP (n = 1), death from cancer (n = 1), occurrence of immune-related hepatitis (n = 1), extension of the treatment duration more than 6 weeks (n = 1), and attending physician's decision (n = 1). Six weeks after the start of the study treatment, 16 (28.5%) patients demonstrated complete recovery from irP, 35 (62.5%) had a partial improvement in irP, 1 (1.8%) had a relapse of irP, and 4 (7.1%) were not evaluable. The pneumonitis control rate at 6 weeks was 91.1% (95% CI, 80.7% to 96.1%). Twelve weeks after the start of the study treatment, 5 (8.9%), 27 (48.2%), and 15 (26.8%) patients demonstrated complete recovery, partial improvement, and relapse, respectively, and 9 (16.1%) were not evaluable. The pneumonitis control rate at 12 weeks was 57.1% (95% CI, 44.1% to 69.2%). During the observation period, 18 (32.1%) patients experienced a relapse of irP, and of those, 17 received re-treatment with corticosteroids. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 10 (17.9%) patients, in which hyperglycemia was most frequent (n = 6). There was no treatment-related death.

Conclusions

In this first prospective study for irP, prednisolone at 1mg/kg/day, tapered over 6 weeks, demonstrated a promising clinical benefit and manageable toxicity, suggesting a potential treatment option for irP.

### Anti-VEGF antibody protects against alveolar exudate leakage caused by vascular hyperpermeability, resulting in mitigation of pneumonitis induced by immunotherapy [^111J293S]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis is one of the most serious immune-related adverse events, no preventive measures have been established. Although steroid therapy is an effective treatment, it carries the risk of suppressing the antitumor effect of checkpoint inhibitors. We demonstrated that among patients with NSCLC, the clinical outcome of pneumonitis induced by atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was better in patients treated with bevacizumab than in those without bevacizumab. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with pneumonitis who used steroids was lower in the group treated with bevacizumab than in the group without. Anti-VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumab are reported to have additive or synergistic effects when administered in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies (such as atezolizumab) in NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-VEGF antibodies plus checkpoint inhibitors may be a treatment method that can control at least a part of checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis without loss of therapeutic effects. On the other hands, mechanism of checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis is not clear and there is a limit what we can learn from our research in an IL2- plus IL18-induced murine pneumonitis model and the particular group of patients. Further study will be needed to clarify the clinically relevant mitigation effects of bevacizumab on immune-related pneumonitis.

In conclusion, we have shown that an anti-VEGF antibody protected against vascular-to-alveolar leakage of protein and fluid, resulting in mitigation of checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis in a murine model. Our findings suggest that bevacizumab may be a meaningful therapeutic option for patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, not only in terms of enhancing their antitumor effect but also in terms of reducing some side effects.

### Investigating risk factors and treatment options for severe, partially steroid responsive, and steroid-refractory checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis [^115wucv9]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for partially steroid-responsive or steroid-refractory pneumonitis

Of the 132 ICI-p patients, 74 (56%) had partially steroid-responsive or steroid-refractory pneumonitis (22 patients required recurrent steroids after initial pneumonitis treatment, 27 patients required an increase in steroids during initial pneumonitis treatment, 25 died while being treated for active pneumonitis) and 58 (44%) did not. Patients who received less than 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent of corticosteroid at ICI-p diagnosis had more partially steroid-responsive and steroid-refractory disease (P = 0.014, Table 5); patients in the < 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent group received a median dose of 60 mg (0.67 mg/kg) of prednisone, while the group treated with at least 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent steroids received a median dose of 82.5 mg (1.06 mg/kg) of prednisone (Supplementary Table S1). There was no difference in days to steroid initiation from pneumonitis imaging and days from initial steroid administration to first steroid taper between the two groups (Supplementary Table S2).

Table 5.
Risk factors for partially steroid-responsive or steroid-refractory ICI-p.

Of the 124 patients with pre-treatment chest imaging, the presence of ground glass (P = 0.004) and severe interstitial abnormalities (P = 0.001) were associated with partially steroid-responsive and steroid-refractory ICIa-p. Of the 132 ICI-p patients, 64 of the 74 patients with partially steroid-responsive or steroid-refractory ICI-p and 55 of the 58 patients with steroid-responsive ICI-p had a chest CT following diagnosis of ICI-p. The presence of consolidative changes at the time of ICI-p diagnosis was associated with severe and partially steroid-responsive ICI-p (P = 0.03, Table 5). Other radiographic patterns at ICI-p diagnosis and the route of steroid administration were not associated with steroid-refractory or partially steroid-responsive disease.

Survival analysis of mild versus severe pneumonitis

Severity of ICI-p and its impact on survival was evaluated as a secondary outcome. The severity of ICI-p was divided into mild (grade 1–2) and severe (grade 3–5). Of our 132 patients, 60 patients developed mild pneumonitis and 72 patients developed severe pneumonitis. Patients with severe pneumonitis had worse overall survival when compared to mild pneumonitis (P < .0001, Figure 1).

### Treatment of mycophenolate-resistant immune-related organizing pneumonia with infliximab [^114jg8Tx]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of immune-related pneumopathy that developed during checkpoint blockade in the case of steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent disease exist (NCCN guidelines). Several immunosuppressants are suggested including mycophenolate, or cyclophosphamide. Cases of pneumonitis with treatment strategies have been described in the literature. In one case, an immune-related pneumonitis caused by PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a patient with advanced esophageal carcinoma was described. After six cycles of pembrolizumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks), the CT-scan showed diffuse ground glass opacity and consolidation in both lungs. Cellular interstitial pneumonitis was confirmed by pathological examination. Patient's symptoms were alleviated after corticosteroid therapy. The pneumonitis reoccurred twice after stopping or tapering steroids quickly and could also be controlled by using steroids again (steroid dependency). No specifics were given of alternative immunosuppressants. Three cases with pneumonitis were reported in patients that have received radiotherapy prior to PD-1 blockade. A series of 3 cases reported 1 patient who received nivolumab and ipilimumab sequentially, a second patient was treated with nivolumab and a third patient with ipilimumab before starting nivolumab. The onset of pneumonitis occurred 7.4 to 24.3 months after the initiation of therapy. It is important to be aware that patients can develop this severe side effect even years after the initiation of PD-(L)1 blockade. CT imaging revealed findings seen in interstitial pneumonias. These conditions were CT-morphologically classified as acute interstitial pneumonia–acute respiratory distress syndrome (diffuse alveolar damage). Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and received intravenous antibiotic agents, glucocorticoids, and infliximab. Patient 1 required intubation, and his condition improved over the course of 10 weeks. Patient 2 died 4 weeks after the diagnosis of pneumonitis. Patient 3 had ground-glass opacities and reticular opacities indicative of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. He discontinued nivolumab for 8 weeks and received oral glucocorticoids as an outpatient, and the pneumonitis resolved. In the cases reviewed by Naidoo et al. all patients with grade 3 or higher pneumonitis received oral/intravenous corticosteroids initially (n = 12), five (42%) of whom required additional immunosuppression (three with infliximab and two with both infliximab plus cyclophosphamide). For most patients who began oral corticosteroids, this was the maximum immunosuppression used (14 of 17 [82%]), with a median starting dose of prednisone of 50 mg (range, 20 to 80 mg) and median duration of corticosteroid treatment of 68 days (range, 20 to 154 days). In another cohort, 3 out 20 patients with pneumonitis were treated with infliximab. In one patient, a combination treatment with cyclophosphamide and infliximab was needed. An overview of published cases with pneumonitis and infliximab treatment can be seen in Table 1. According to current evidence and guidelines (NCCN guidelines), we treated the patient initially with 1 mg/kg prednisone for grade 2 late onset immune-related pneumonitis. The patient became steroid-refractory and the immune suppression was extended by adding the classical immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil. It remains unclear which type of additional immunosuppressants is preferable in this situation. The late onset organizing pneumonia was not controlled and a further therapy with infliximab was started with rapidly improving pulmonary lesions. This outcome suggests that in the case of late onset pneumonitis during immune checkpoint blockade, TNFα inhibitors might be preferable compared to classical immunosuppressants, although more studies are needed to confirm this.

PEMBROLIZUMAB

Over the last few years, pembrolizumab has been used in multiple solid and nonsolid malignancies as first, subsequent line or maintenance treatment, alone or in combination with chemo/radiotherapy or other ICIs. Pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis of various grades has been reported with both pembrolizumab monotherapy or in combination with standard chemo/radiotherapy or other ICIs in patients with NSCLC, with incidence ranging from 2.8% to 28%. Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced NSCLC either as first-line or second line monotherapy based on the phase III KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-010 trials. Any grade and severe (grades 3–5) pneumonitis were reported in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients in KEYNOTE-010 and 7.8% and 2.6% of patients in KEYNOTE-024, respectively. In addition, pembrolizumab is approved in combination with (nab)paclitaxel and platinum for metastasized squamous NSCLC based on the results of the phase III KEYNOTE-407 trial. Notably, this combination was associated with one of the highest prevalence of reported irAEs, with pneumonitis being particularly prevalent (any grade pneumonitis 6.5%, and greater than grade 3 pneumonitis 2.5%, including one patient with grade 5 pneumonitis). Overall, pneumonitis of any grade has been reported in 3.4% of patients treated with pembrolizumab for various cancers and in 8.2% of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab as single agent first-line treatment, with severe pneumonitis occurring in 1.3% and 3.2% of cases, respectively. These numbers may be higher in patients with preexisting ILD, but this is unclear as these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials of ICIs.

### Recurrent pneumonitis in patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112hisjW]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the oncologic landscape in the past few years. Alongside impressive antitumor responses, new novel immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged; pneumonitis is an irAE that can potentially be fatal and necessitates a proper management. No consensus exists regarding steroid treatment duration or drug rechallenge options. Our study describes the clinical and radiological course of melanoma patients diagnosed with immune-related pneumonitis that has recurred because of rechallenge attempt or despite complete treatment discontinuation (unprovoked).

Materials and Methods

The study population was composed of patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and who were diagnosed with immune-related pneumonitis. For recurrent cases after clinical and radiological resolution, we explored the differences from cases with no recurrence.

Results

Nineteen out of 386 (4.8%) patients treated with ICI were diagnosed with pneumonitis. Median age was 66years, and 53% were male. Compared with single-agent nivolumab, patients treated with ipilimumab-nivolumab combination presented with an earlier onset (27.5 vs. 10.3weeks, respectively, p = .015) and had higher grades of severity. After complete resolution, rechallenge was attempted in seven patients; three of them had recurrent pneumonitis. Three other patients experienced recurrent pneumonitis despite complete discontinuation of the drug (unprovoked by rechallenge). The latter were characterized with an earlier onset of the first pneumonitis compared with those who did not experience recurrence (median, 12.4 vs. 26.4weeks) and a shorter course of steroid treatment at first episode (median, 5.1 vs. 10weeks). Recurrent cases were generally more severe than the first episode.

Conclusion

Unprovoked recurrent pneumonitis is a new, poorly reported entity that requires further investigation. Our observations suggest that cases of pneumonitis that present early in the course of immunotherapy treatment may recur despite treatment discontinuation, thus necessitating closer monitoring and a longer course of steroid treatment.

Implications For Practice

This article sheds light on a poorly described immune-related adverse event: recurrent pneumonitis despite complete discontinuation of immunotherapy (unprovoked), in patients with advanced melanoma.

Drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — multidisciplinary discussion and guideline use is emphasized: it is appropriate for clinicians to discuss these issues at a multidisciplinary conference and with patients to reach a shared decision regarding preferred course of action, and major clinical guidelines for specific entities such as immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis should be considered for patient treatment in specific clinical settings when relevant.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor fatal toxicity and CT pattern correlations show that drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) was the most common toxicity leading to PD-1/PD-L1-related mortality, accounting for 35% of all deaths; in a study of 20 patients with DRP among 170 treated with PD-1 inhibitors, OP pattern was found in 13 patients and was most common, followed by NSIP in three, HP in two, and DAD in two, and CT patterns were associated with toxicity grades with DAD the highest, OP next, and NSIP and HP lower. Management included corticosteroids in seven and infliximab in three; seven patients were re-treated, of whom two redeveloped DRP, and one patient demonstrated pneumonitis flare-up on tapering of corticosteroids without re-treatment.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

OPDIVO as a Single Agent

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 1.1% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients. Of the 15 patients in whom OPDIVO was withheld for pneumonitis, 14 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement; of these, 4 (29%) had recurrence of pneumonitis.

OPDIVO with Ipilimumab

OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg: In NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 5% of patients and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients. Approximately 13% (2/16) of patients had recurrence of pneumonitis after reinitiation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

105, 110Newer data suggest that approximately 2% of patients with NSCLC or melanoma with immune-related toxicity experienced chronic pneumonitis, which persists despite ICPi discontinuation and may not resolve after > 3 months of corticosteroids. 111 P = 0.005) according to the Nishino et al. 103However, ICPi pneumonitis may not clinically improve after > 48 hours of corticosteroid therapy, at which time it is deemed steroid-refractory. There is no standard immunosuppressive therapy for this clinical situation; however, options include infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immune globulin, or cyclophosphamide, based on two large retrospective experiences. 124Similarly, fludrocortisone is needed in addition to hydrocortisone in most cases of primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves the loss of mineralocorticoid as well as glucocorticoid production by the adrenal gland, leading to more-profound blood pressure and electrolyte abnormalities.

139, 140Inflammatory markers are usually very elevated in patients with ICPi-induced arthritis and are useful to differentiate these events from other rheumatic syndromes. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required. 143–145Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are an option if only one or two joints are affected. 155ICPi was discontinued in all 13 patients. Eleven patients were treated with corticosteroids, and nine patients improved. One patient with thrombotic microangiopathy did not improve, despite glucocorticoids, and another patient transiently improved but then worsened. Two additional patients did not receive immunosuppression and did not recover renal function.

156–159Although some patients may be treated with PD-1 pathway blockers with preservation of their allografts by having adjustments in their immunosuppressive agents, 161this approach should only be considered with multidisciplinary input from renal transplant nephrology team. 180and can commonly be treated by withholding ICPi, corticosteroids, and IVIG. 177Evaluation for causes of thrombocytopenia must be undertaken, including evaluation of TTP, disseminated intravascular coagulation, myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as immune-mediated thrombocytopenia related to ICPi. Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective with transfusion support as required.

### ASCO guidelines… [^1178zVsV]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

And in a patient who has suspected pneumonitis, some of the first tests to be done would be to take a pulse oximetry and to do some chest imaging. Chest imaging is preferable with a CT scan with contrast in order to rule out alternative etiology, such as pulmonary embolus. And usually, radiographically, patients have more of the lung parenchyma involved — greater than 25% — and require a medical intervention. And the management would be prednisone, 1 to 2 milligrams per kilogram per day, that is then tapered over 4 to six weeks, and immunotherapy is held during that time. If patients do not clinically improve after 48 to 72 hours on prednisone, then we recommend treating at a higher grade, meaning grade 3, where patients have severe symptoms, hospitalization is required, and a larger proportion of the lung parenchyma is involved.

For these patients who have grade 3 or greater pneumonitis, we recommend permanently discontinuing immunotherapy, administering a higher dose of steroids at methylprednisolone, 1 to 2 milligrams per kilogram per day. And, once again — if there is no improvement after 48 hours, we recommend a range of potential additional immunosuppressive approaches, which include either infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin, or cyclophosphamide. BRITTANY HARVEY: Great. Thank you for that clear, step-wise approach to the evaluation and management of pneumonitis. So then, in your view, Dr. Naidoo — how will these recommendations for the management of lung toxicities impact both clinicians and patients. JARUSHKA NAIDOO: I think it's very important for both clinicians and patients to be aware of the potential side effects of the treatment that patients are receiving with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We know that some toxicities from immunotherapy tend to be mild and can be managed quite well with corticosteroids or other approaches. What we understand about lung toxicities is that, thankfully — in the majority of cases — pneumonitis will be well-controlled with corticosteroids and holding of immunotherapy. However, in a proportion of patients, pneumonitis may become severe and may even lead to treatment-related deaths. And for that reason, both patients and clinicians need to be aware of what to look out for in terms of the symptoms of pneumonitis, and how to diagnose and manage this toxicity quickly and efficiently in order to avoid poor outcomes.

### Inhaled corticosteroid use and risk of pneumonitis in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors… [^111gk7T5]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract 3140 Background: The identification of risk factors for immune-related adverse events is an important area of research. Among irAEs, pneumonitis carries one of the highest morbidities. There is a lack of strong predictors for pneumonitis in patients treated with ICI. We sought to identify predictors for the development of pneumonitis, and whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids at time of ICI could be protective. Results: A total of 837 pts were identified, and 30 pts developed any grade pneumonitis after receiving ICI. Pts with age ≥ 65 years had increased risk of developing pneumonitis over pts with age < 65y. 82 of the total cohort were on inhaled corticosteroid at time of ICI, and 9 developed pneumonitis. Rather than being protective, pts on ICS had higher risk of pneumonitis.

Pts with lung cancer had an increased risk for pneumonitis compared to pts with other cancers. Other risk factors included performance status, smoking history, line of therapy, or prior treatment including radiation were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Rather than a protective effect of ICS, our analysis found a higher risk of pneumonitis in pts treated with ICS. We confirmed an increased risk of pneumonitis for lung cancer pts compared to pts with other cancers, and higher risk of pneumonitis in pts age > 65y. We hypothesize that the increased inflammatory status in chronic lung inflammation may predispose pts to pneumonitis that was not ameliorated by ICS. Future study is needed in prospective cohorts to further clarify the underlying inflammatory mechanism.

This arm will be treated with corticosteroid for at least 12–24 weeks.

ARM B
- CONTROL GROUP the starting dose will be 1–4mg/kg of body weight of prednisone, depending on clinical condition and pneumonitis severity, the induction treatment will last 5–7 days; in case of severe condition
- no improvement after 48–72 h of initial treatment
- **Introduction of immunosuppressive agent is recommended**: cyclophosphamide, mofetil mycophenolate or infliximab. A continuation treatment with dose tapering is than planned, starting from oral dose of 30–60mg q 24h of prednisone, and dose reduction of 10mg q 24 h each 1 week. This arm will be treated for 6–12 weeks. During the treatment and after its termination the function of respiratory system, interstitial changes in radiologic examinations, anticancer response, survival time, pneumonitis relapse and glucocorticosteroid side effects will be monitored and evaluated. The observation will last up to 52 weeks.

In case of elevated inflammatory markers, clinical, laboratory or microbiological signs of infection accompanying pneumonitis it is recommended to administer antibiotics. Antibiotics will not be routinely used in the whole study population. Dosage and administration: The preferred oral agent is prednisone, in single daily dose administered in the morning. The recommended dose of co-trimoxazole in case of PCP prophylaxis is 960mg q2d administered on Monday, Wednesday and Friday; it should last until 10mg q 24h of prednisone is reached.
