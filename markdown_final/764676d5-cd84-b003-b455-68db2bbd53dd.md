## Question

Medical management of SOB following a PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the medical management of shortness of breath following a pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology of persistent dyspnea after PE. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including anticoagulation status and risk stratification. Next, I will examine the differential diagnosis of persistent SOB after PE and the diagnostic workup. After that, I need to consider disease-specific management pathways, including CTEPH/CTEPD, post-PE syndrome, and deconditioning. Finally, I should review supportive care, follow-up, and special populations, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Persistent dyspnea after acute PE is common, reported in up to 40–60% of survivors, and often multifactorial, reflecting pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, deconditioning, anxiety, or sequelae of PE such as CTEPH or post-PE syndrome, so I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on a single cause [^113pogri] [^111nvCpY].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities before jumping to tests. I should confirm that the patient has completed at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation, because persistent symptoms before this window may reflect incomplete treatment rather than chronic sequelae; if anticoagulation is inadequate or interrupted, I should address that first and reassess after stabilization [^111nvCpY] [^114EFSzX].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: persistent SOB after PE can be due to CTEPH or CTEPD, post-PE syndrome with functional limitation, deconditioning, anxiety, pre-existing cardiac or lung disease, or recurrent PE, so I need to check for each of these in a structured way rather than assuming a single etiology [^111nvCpY] [^113pogri].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup. I should confirm that the initial evaluation includes a careful history of symptom trajectory, comorbidities, and risk factors for CTEPH; a focused exam for signs of pulmonary hypertension or right heart dysfunction; and targeted labs such as NT-proBNP, which can help stratify the likelihood of significant PH, though it is not specific and must be interpreted in context [^111nvCpY] [^111YNEax].

> Let me think about imaging and when to escalate. Echocardiography is the first-line test to screen for PH and RV dysfunction; if the echocardiogram shows intermediate or high probability of PH, I should refer to a PH center for further evaluation, whereas if PH probability is low, I should consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing to distinguish pulmonary vascular limitation from deconditioning; perfusion imaging (VQ SPECT or CT perfusion) and CTPA can identify chronic thromboembolic disease when CTEPH/CTEPD is suspected, but I need to ensure we are not over-calling incidental perfusion defects without correlating symptoms and hemodynamics [^111YNEax] [^112dFbLH].

> Hold on, I should verify the criteria for CTEPH versus CTEPD. CTEPD requires at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation, persistent symptoms, mismatched perfusion defects, and organized fibrotic clot on CTPA or angiography, with the absence of PH; if PH is present, the diagnosis becomes CTEPH, which carries different management implications and mandates referral to specialized centers [^114EFSzX].

> For CTEPH, I need to ensure timely referral and definitive therapy. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the cornerstone for operable patients, with excellent outcomes in experienced centers; for inoperable or residual disease, riociguat and balloon pulmonary angioplasty are evidence-based options, and I should coordinate care through a PH center to optimize selection and sequencing of therapies [^notfound].

> For CTEPD without PH, let me reconsider the approach. Management is primarily supportive, with continuation of anticoagulation individualized to recurrence risk and clot burden, and enrollment in supervised exercise rehabilitation to improve functional capacity; I should confirm that symptoms persist beyond 3 months and that other causes have been reasonably excluded before labeling CTEPD [^112dFbLH] [^113qv3N7].

> For post-PE syndrome without CTEPH/CTEPD, I should double-check that I am not missing deconditioning or anxiety. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and quality of life in selected patients with persistent dyspnea after PE, and I should set expectations about gradual recovery while screening for and treating comorbid mood disorders and providing education on pacing and activity progression [^113qv3N7].

> But wait, what if the SOB reflects recurrent PE or an alternative diagnosis? I should confirm adherence and adequacy of anticoagulation, consider imaging for recurrence if symptoms are disproportionate or new, and keep a broad differential including heart failure, COPD, asthma, anemia, and anxiety; in patients with cancer, I need to ensure ongoing anticoagulation is optimized because cancer-associated thrombosis carries high recurrence risk and often warrants extended or indefinite therapy [^111nvCpY] [^1158hVBk].

> I need to ensure supportive care is aligned with the underlying cause. Oxygen is reasonable for hypoxemia, but I should avoid reflexive oxygen in nonhypoxemic patients given limited benefit for refractory dyspnea; for significant anxiety or hyperventilation, consider breathing retraining and, when appropriate, anxiolytics; for deconditioning, prescribe structured, progressive exercise with close follow-up to track gains and adjust load [^1174pfC4] [^113qv3N7].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and what to monitor. A practical approach is reassessment at 3 months to confirm anticoagulation course, symptom trajectory, and functional status; if dyspnea persists, repeat echocardiography and consider CPET or perfusion imaging as indicated; annual review is reasonable for patients on extended anticoagulation to reassess bleeding risk, recurrence risk, and patient preferences [^111nvCpY] [^116zNBYV].

> Let me consider special populations briefly. In patients with cancer, I should maintain a low threshold for extended anticoagulation and coordinate with oncology; in pregnancy and postpartum, I should tailor imaging and anticoagulant choices to maternal-fetal safety; in renal impairment, I need to adjust DOAC dosing and consider alternatives when contraindicated; in older adults, I should balance bleeding risk against recurrence risk and consider frailty in rehabilitation planning [^1158hVBk] [^116Ffbzt].

> I should double-check that my decision algorithm is coherent: confirm adequate anticoagulation and reassess at 3 months; if SOB persists, screen for CTEPH with echocardiography and, if positive, refer to a PH center; if PH probability is low, evaluate for deconditioning and post-PE syndrome with CPET and consider rehabilitation; throughout, keep a high index for recurrence and alternative diagnoses, and individualize anticoagulation duration using shared decision-making and guideline-based risk stratification [^111nvFFn] [^111YNEax] [^116zNBYV].

> In summary, persistent SOB after PE is common and multifactorial; I need to ensure a structured, stepwise evaluation that prioritizes confirming anticoagulation adequacy, screening for CTEPH/CTEPD when indicated, addressing post-PE syndrome and deconditioning with rehabilitation, and maintaining vigilance for recurrence or alternative diagnoses, all while aligning therapy with patient values and evolving risk profiles [^113pogri] [^111nvFFn] [^113qv3N7].

Shortness of breath after pulmonary embolism (PE) is common and often multifactorial, so management should be **individualized and guideline-based** [^111nvFFn]. The key steps are: confirm adequate anticoagulation and exclude recurrence; screen for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) with echocardiography and, if indicated, V/Q scan or CTPA; treat identified causes (e.g. CTEPH, heart failure, COPD, anxiety); and enroll patients with persistent dyspnea in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation [^113qv3N7]. Most patients improve with this approach, but a minority will have ongoing symptoms requiring specialist referral and advanced therapies [^113pogri].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic workup

### Initial assessment

- **Confirm anticoagulation**: Ensure the patient is receiving appropriate anticoagulation and assess adherence [^111nvFFn].
- **Exclude recurrence**: Evaluate for recurrent PE with clinical assessment, D-dimer if indicated, and imaging (CTPA or V/Q scan) if suspicion is high [^116wmKo1].
- **Assess severity**: Use validated tools (e.g. mMRC dyspnea scale, 6-minute walk test) to quantify functional impairment [^notfound].

---

### Screening for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)

CTEPH is a **major cause of persistent dyspnea** after PE, with a prevalence of 2–4% at 2 years [^113pogri]. Screening should be systematic:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Findings suggestive of CTEPH** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Transthoracic echocardiography | - RV systolic pressure > 35 mmHg <br/> - RV dilation/dysfunction <br/> - Septal flattening [^notfound] |
| 2 | Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan | Multiple segmental perfusion defects with normal ventilation [^notfound] |
| 3 | CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) | - Organized thrombi <br/> - Webs <br/> - Mosaic perfusion <br/> - Dilated bronchial arteries [^111nvFFn] |

---

If CTEPH is suspected, **refer to a specialized center** for confirmatory testing and management [^112dFbLH].

---

### Evaluation of alternative causes

Persistent dyspnea is often multifactorial; evaluate for:

- **Cardiac disease**: Heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular disease [^111YNEax].
- **Respiratory disease**: COPD, asthma, interstitial lung disease [^117QQ5K3].
- **Anxiety/depression**: Common after PE, contributing to dyspnea perception [^114EFSzX].
- **Anemia**: Frequent and modifiable contributor to dyspnea [^notfound].

---

## Medical management strategies

### Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of PE management; ensure **adequate therapy** and adherence [^116wmKo1]. For most patients, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred due to efficacy, safety, and convenience [^116wmKo1]. Duration is guided by provocation: 3 months for provoked PE, and extended or indefinite therapy for unprovoked PE or high recurrence risk [^117T3ypv] [^116zNBYV].

---

### Management of CTEPH

- **Pulmonary endarterectomy**: Curative surgery for operable patients [^notfound].
- **Balloon pulmonary angioplasty**: For inoperable or residual disease [^notfound].
- **Riociguat**: First-line medical therapy for inoperable or persistent CTEPH [^notfound].

---

### Management of post-PE syndrome

Post-PE syndrome is defined by persistent dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or functional impairment after adequate anticoagulation, without CTEPH [^113pogri]. Management is **supportive and multidisciplinary**:

- **Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life [^113qv3N7].
- **Psychological support**: Address anxiety, depression, and PTSD [^notfound].
- **Symptomatic treatment**: Bronchodilators, diuretics, oxygen if hypoxic [^notfound].

---

### Management of alternative causes

Treat identified comorbidities per standard care: optimize heart failure therapy, manage COPD/asthma, correct anemia, and provide **anxiety management** [^111YNEax].

---

## Role of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is a **cornerstone** for persistent dyspnea after PE, with benefits including:

- Improved exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test) [^113qv3N7].
- Reduced dyspnea and fatigue.
- Enhanced quality of life.
- Better psychological well-being.

Programs typically last 6–12 weeks and include supervised exercise, education, and psychosocial support [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor recovery, detect complications, and adjust therapy. At 3–6 months, reassess dyspnea, functional status, and adherence; screen for CTEPH if symptoms persist [^111nvFFn]. Annually, review anticoagulation, bleeding risk, and recurrence risk; repeat echocardiography if PH is suspected [^116zNBYV].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Education improves adherence and outcomes; counsel on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and when to seek care. Encourage smoking cessation, weight management, and regular physical activity. Provide resources for anxiety/depression and connect patients with support groups [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm adequate anticoagulation and exclude recurrence |
| 2 | Screen for CTEPH with echocardiography and V/Q scan or CTPA if indicated |
| 3 | Evaluate for alternative causes (cardiac, respiratory, anxiety, anemia) |
| 4 | Initiate cardiopulmonary rehabilitation |
| 5 | Treat identified comorbidities |
| 6 | Provide patient education and arrange regular follow-up |

---

Persistent dyspnea after PE requires a **structured, guideline-based approach**: confirm anticoagulation, exclude recurrence, screen for CTEPH, evaluate other causes, and implement rehabilitation. Most patients improve with this strategy, but some need specialist referral and advanced therapies [^111nvFFn].

What should I do if my patient is breathless following at least 3 months of anticoagulation for an acute PE?

Breathlessness is present in up to half of all patients following an acute PEand is most frequently due to pre-existing cardiac and/or respiratory disease, deconditioning and/or anxiety. The assessment of breathlessness should include: (1) an assessment of severity and recovery from the index PE; (2) the temporal relationship to the index PE; (3) features associated with lung disease, such as frequent coughing, wheezing or lung infections and/or cardiac disease such as chest pain, ankle swelling and orthopnoea; (4) identification of known comorbidities and (5) an assessment for risk factors for CTEPH. Risk factors for CTEPH include history of/or recurrent VTE, the absence of major transient risk factors for VTE, large clot burden, echocardiographic features of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and/or right ventricle (RV) dysfunction and CT imaging features suggestive of pre-existing CTEPH on the initial diagnostic scan (dilated bronchial arteries, webs, attenuated vessels, eccentric clot, mosaic perfusion and CT features of PH). In the event that no treatable comorbidities are identified, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation may be considered.

Pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism (PE) are two life-threatening causes of shortness of breath in patients presenting to the emergency department. A rare but more serious presentation is that of simultaneous PE and pneumothorax. We present the case of a young patient, with no known comorbidities, who presented with simultaneous submassive PE and pneumothorax. We will review how these two diagnoses may be related, consider the implications of having this dual diagnosis on the patient's management and review the current evidence surrounding thrombolysis in submassive PE.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. For many of the dilemmas the evidence base is not substantial and is potentially hampered by reporting bias. Management in an individual patient will require clinical assessment of risks and benefits and will also depend on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants… [^116K8NYS]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the two most important manifestations of venous thromboembolism, which is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular disease, after myocardial infarction and stroke, in the United States. Approximately one-third of patients with VTE present with PE, and two-thirds present with DVT. 1 Compared with DVT, PE is more often fatal, has a higher recurrence rate, and is associated with more serious long-term complications. Of patients with proximal DVT, 40% have an associated PE, whereas 70% of patients with PE also have DVT.
3. Initial Management Prompt diagnosis and treatment of VTE with appropriate medications may prevent thrombus extension and embolization, relieve acute symptoms, prevent cardiopulmonary collapse, and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Empiric treatment during the evaluation period is controversial and not evidence-based.

In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high probability of VTE, intravenous thrombolytic therapy can be considered. 8, 10, 11 Evidence supports outpatient treatment of PE if the risk of nonadherence is low and the patient is clinically stable; has no contraindications to anticoagulation, such as recent bleeding, severe renal or liver disease, or platelet count of less than 70 × 10³ per mm³; and feels capable of managing the disease at home. 8, 10 Patients with PE who are hemodynamically unstable should be admitted to an intensive care unit, and systemic thrombolytic therapy may be considered.
9. Thrombolysis Because of the high risk of bleeding, thrombolysis is restricted to specific circumstances. Expert consensus guidelines support thrombolytic therapy in patients with persistent hypotension or shock secondary to acute PE.

9 Also, when patients with acute PE who are on anticoagulation deteriorate but are not yet hypotensive, systemic thrombolysis is recommended as long as the risk of bleeding is low. 8 There is better evidence for systemic thrombolysis than for catheter-directed thrombolysis. 8 If systemic thrombolysis fails, catheter-directed thrombolysis is available as a rescue therapy in centers with appropriate expertise. Thrombolysis is not indicated in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE. 23.

Pulmonary embolism workup — D-dimer is used in suspected pulmonary embolism; its sensitivity is much greater than specificity and positive predictive value is poor, so its primary value is rapid identification of patients with low probability of pulmonary embolism in outpatient settings, while its negative predictive value is poor in hospitalized patients, especially after several days or in patients older than 60 years of age.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

### The effects of exercise training in patients with persistent dyspnea following pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^113qv3N7]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent dyspnea, functional limitations, and reduced quality of life (QoL) are common following pulmonary embolism (PE). Rehabilitation is a potential treatment option, but the scientific evidence is limited.

Research Question

Does an exercise-based rehabilitation program improve exercise capacity in PE survivors with persistent dyspnea?

Study Design and Methods

This randomized controlled trial was conducted at two hospitals. Patients with persistent dyspnea following PE diagnosed 6 to 72 months earlier, without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, were randomized 1:1 to either the rehabilitation or the control group. The rehabilitation program consisted of two weekly sessions of physical exercise for 8 weeks and one educational session. The control group received usual care. The primary end point was the difference in Incremental Shuttle Walk Test between groups at follow-up. Secondary end points included differences in the Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT), QoL (EQ-5D and Pulmonary Embolism-QoL questionnaires) and dyspnea (Shortness of Breath questionnaire).

Results

A total of 211 subjects were included: 108 (51%) were randomized to the rehabilitation group and 103 (49%) to the control group. At follow-up, participants allocated to the rehabilitation group performed better on the ISWT compared with the control group (mean difference, 53.0 m; 95% CI, 17.7–88.3; P = 0.0035). The rehabilitation group reported better scores on the Pulmonary Embolism-QoL questionnaire (mean difference, -4%; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.00; P = 0.041) at follow-up, but there were no differences in generic QoL, dyspnea scores, or the ESWT. No adverse events occurred during the intervention.

Interpretation

In patients with persistent dyspnea following PE, those who underwent rehabilitation had better exercise capacity at follow-up than those who received usual care. Rehabilitation should be considered in patients with persistent dyspnea following PE. Further research is needed, however, to assess the optimal patient selection, timing, mode, and duration of rehabilitation.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical condition that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Although diagnosis, anticoagulation, and interventional clot-burden reduction strategies represent the focus of clinical research and care in PE, appropriate risk stratification and supportive care are crucial to ensure good outcomes. In this chapter, we will discuss the medical management of PE from the time of presentation to discharge, focusing on the critical care of acute right ventricular failure, anticoagulation of special patient populations, and appropriate follow-up testing after acute PE.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113V2Lu5]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Eight physicians with an interest in the management of acute and chronic pulmonary embolic disease compiled a list of 14 challenging clinical issues faced in their day-to-day practice. A PubMed search for each dilemma was performed, an initial review and suggested approach drafted followed by round-table discussion to achieve consensus regarding management. In many dilemmas, conclusions based on the available literature, were hampered by patient numbers and reporting bias. Suggested approaches were provided based on consensus.

### Association of race and in-hospital outcomes following acute pulmonary embolism: a retrospective cohort study [^112ECgYF]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, there was no difference in in‐hospital mortality between Black and White patients with acute PE. This is a divergence from prior studies and likely reflects several unique aspects of PE care that facilitate healthcare equity. First, CT utilization has dramatically risen in the last decade and offers the advantage not only of being widely available in emergency departments but also allows for RV assessment at the time of PE diagnosis. Additionally, troponin and BNP assessment of the undifferentiated patient presenting to the emergency department have become standard in the initial work‐up of chest pain and shortness of breath. Many emergency departments, including our own, have adopted algorithms to guide the workup of undifferentiated patients and those suspected of having PE. The widespread implementation of these tools can counteract implicit bias and makes PE care distinct from other fields that still rely on clinician assessment to determine candidacy for therapies.

While advanced therapies for the management of PE have emerged in recent years, their utilization was low in the present cohort, limiting the ability to detect a disparity. Less than 5% of all patients received catheter‐based therapies or ECMO. Whereas cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure have successfully implemented widespread guideline‐directed medical therapies and advanced mechanical circulatory support options, data supporting optimal patient selection for catheter‐based therapies is limited and anticoagulation remains the mainstay of PE management. We did observe a disproportionate use of warfarin therapy amongst Black patients compared to other anticoagulants. It is possible that the initiation of warfarin and concurrent need for bridging therapy contributed to the longer hospital LOS observed in the Black population. DOAC therapy, however, does not require this bridging period, and has been associated with a reduced hospital length of stay. Additionally, over 30% of White patients were treated with low‐molecular‐weight heparin, an observation that may reflect the higher rate of malignancy in this group. While data on insurance status or medication co‐payment was not available for this cohort, these potential confounders may not fully explain these trends.

### Pulmonary embolism… [^112agALg]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The clot most often comes from the leg veins and travels through the heart to the lungs. When the blood clot lodges in the blood vessels of the lung, it may limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain, and, in serious cases, death. The US surgeon general estimates that 100 000 to 180 000 deaths occur from PE each year in the United States and identifies PE as the most preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. The January 9, 2013, issue of JAMA contains an article about management of PE. Risk factors Genetic and acquired tendencies to develop blood clots.

Pregnancy; use of birth control pills or hormone therapy Obesity Smoking Cancer Medical illnesses including heart disease, lung disease, and kidney disease Older age Recent surgery, trauma, hospitalization, or prolonged bed rest Signs and symptoms Shortness of breath Chest discomfort Coughing up blood. Palpitations Dizziness and fainting Leg swelling and discomfort Treatment Anticoagulants are the main treatment for pulmonary embolism and work by preventing new blood clots from forming while the body breaks down the pulmonary embolism. Options for anticoagulation in patients with PE include intravenous heparin and injectable enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux. Oral anticoagulants for PE include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Most patients with PE receive at least 6 months of anticoagulation treatment. Many patients are advised to continue anticoagulation treatment for longer than 6 months, sometimes lifelong, if their risk of recurrent PE is high.

For some patients with large or massive pulmonary embolism, more aggressive therapy is required. These treatments include clot-dissolving medications, invasive procedures to remove the embolus with catheters or surgery, and implantation of a filter device to catch free blood clots before they reach the heart.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^116wmKo1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

### The evidence base for oxygen for chronic refractory breathlessness: issues, gaps, and a future work plan [^1174pfC4]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Breathlessness or "shortness of breath", medically termed dyspnea, is a common and distressing symptom featuring strongly in advanced lung, cardiac, and neuromuscular diseases; its prevalence and intensity increase as death approaches. However, despite the increasing understanding in the genesis of breathlessness, as well as an increasing portfolio of treatment options, breathlessness is still difficult to manage and engenders helplessness in caregivers and health care professionals and fear for patients. Although hypoxemia does not appear to be the dominant driver for breathlessness in advanced disease, the belief that oxygen is important for the relief of acute, chronic, and acute-on-chronic shortness of breath is firmly embedded in the minds of patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. This article presents current understanding of the use of oxygen for treating refractory breathlessness in advanced disease. The objective is to highlight what is still unknown, set a research agenda to resolve these questions, and highlight methodological issues for consideration in planned studies.

### Computerised clinical decision support system for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism: a preclinical pilot study [^114sYfpY]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease entity without specific clinical findingsand its presentation offers a diagnostic challenge for physicians assessing patients with shortness of breath or chest pain. Several strategies and approaches have been suggested to increase the accuracy for the diagnosis of PEand for narrowing the gap between practice and evidence-based practice guidelines. Despite the efforts, literaturesuggests that a concerning 43% of patients suspected to have PE have received inappropriate diagnostic management. Furthermore, the threat of inappropriate diagnostic management overlaps the two dimensions of underestimating and overestimating the probability of PE. Underestimating this probability can be fatal, while an overestimation may lead to potential complications such as bleedingand ordering unnecessary tests with increased radiation exposure.

Diagnostic decisions are often complicated by uncertainty, imperfect tests and potential harm for patients who are misdiagnosed. While the diagnostic performance of physicians has benefited from clinical decision support aids in a variety of situationsand specifically for the prevention of deep venous thromboembolismand diagnosis of PE, effective design for decision support is lacking. Indeed, there is a gap between available design that has limited itself to content representation (eg, flow chart, pocket aid or applying a score in online tools) and what is expected of a design that takes in consideration knowledge constructs, heuristics and temporal constraints to support higher level analytical tasks. On this matter, clinicians rely on intuitive problem solving for decision-making most of the time by using heuristics that offer some advantages in terms of efficiency and resourcefulness. However, failures of such diagnostic strategies were shown by Tversky and Kahnemanwho studied, for example, the conjunction fallacy (giving a conjunction greater probability than either of the two components) in a PE decision task. Additionally, in another study, irrelevant anchors influenced the judgement of physicians who were tasked with estimating pretest probability for PE. From the above, there is a great need for decision support systems that extend their value to mitigate failures in clinical reasoning in addition to presenting knowledge and higher level cognitive tasks. In fact, while data and graphic design recommendations have demonstrated their potential benefit in different medical applications, a similar approach for design recommendations has yet to inform the design of interfaces for diagnostic decision support systems.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

This first of two practice reviews addresses pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis considering important aspects of PE clinical presentation and comparing evidence-based PE testing strategies. A companion paper addresses the management of PE. Symptoms and signs of PE are varied, and emergency physicians frequently use testing to 'rule out' the diagnosis in people with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. The emergency clinician must balance the benefit of reassuring negative PE testing with the risks of iatrogenic harms from over investigation and overdiagnosis.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^114EFSzX]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

What is the difference between CTEPD and post-PE syndrome?

CTEPD was first precisely defined in the ERS statement on chronic thromboembolic disease. The definition was further clarified in the ESC/ERS PH guidelines in 2022. To be present, the following criteria should be met: (1) therapeutic anticoagulation must have been in place for at least 3 months; (2) symptoms of breathlessness must be present; (3) there are mismatched perfusion defects on perfusion imaging (VQ SPECT, MR perfusion maps, CT perfusion maps); (4) features of organised, fibrotic clots seen on CTPA or conventional pulmonary angiography; (5) and the absence of PH. If PH is present, the condition becomes CTEPH (ie, CTEPD with PH). Asymptomatic patients may have chronic, organised, fibrotic clots or perfusion defects, but this is not CTEPD.

The term post-PE syndrome was first proposed in 2014and its definition has changed over time. It is an umbrella term for several conditions directly related to post-acute PE, including CTEPD, due to its broad criteria. An updated definition of the syndrome has been published recently by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. This definition requires ≥ 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation following a confirmed acute PE and includes the presence of one or more of the following: (1) post-PE functional impairment; (2) post-PE cardiac impairment; (3) CTEPD with no PH or (4) CTEPH. Post-PE functional impairment requires new or worsening breathlessness post-PE, reduced exercise capacity or other functional limitation without an adequate alternative explanation. This may be related to pulmonary vascular or cardiac sequelae of the PE. More commonly, it is due to deconditioningor psychological consequencesof the acute PE event. Post-PE cardiac impairment refers to intermediate or high echocardiographic probability of PH according to ESC/ERS criteria. This may indicate the presence of PH, or simply right heart dysfunction or a combination of both.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is challenging to even the most seasoned physician. Although dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and haemoptysis are hallmark features, PE also presents with non‐specific symptoms like fever, syncope or cough. While hormone use, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) are well‐known predisposing factors, recent infection, autoimmune or inflammatory bowel disease and recent admission for heart failure or myocardial infarction are also risks. Pregnancy increases risk, particularly in the third trimester until 6 weeks post‐partum, though evidence for increased risk in the first two trimesters is less convincing. Advanced age, obesity and smoking amplify these risks.PE should be considered in any patient with common presenting symptoms and pervasive risk factors.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Perfusion abnormalities are common following acute PE and, depending on the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings, may not require any further investigation. Access to perfusion imaging (eg, ventilation–perfusion (VQ) SPECT) or Q SPECT is not universal, and the presence of chronic lung disease reduces the specificity of such scans. Perfusion lung maps can also be obtained at the time of CTPA using dual energy CT or using lung subtraction iodine mapping, allowing an assessment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) and CT features of PH, as well as lung perfusion.

Some patients with breathlessness following an acute PE have a low probability of PH on echocardiogram and have abnormal perfusion scan and/or evidence of chronic, organised fibrotic clot on CTPA. Before considering further assessment, it is important to consider other causes of breathlessness, particularly deconditioning, left heart disease and lung disease. Where deconditioning is suspected, it may be reasonable to advise a graded increase in exercise with review before considering further investigation. Where there is diagnostic doubt, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may be helpful. If pulmonary vascular disease is the dominant problem limiting exercise, you would expect CPET to demonstrate inefficient ventilation due to high dead space in the lungs. However, deconditioning is commonly found on CPET in patients with persistent breathlessness following an acute PE. Stress echocardiogram is an alternative modality and can demonstrate exercise-induced PH; however, it is not commonly performed in this setting.NT-proBNP may also help stratify the likelihood of significant PH, although data is limitedand elevated levels are also frequently seen in left heart disease, which is a common comorbidity.

Pulmonary embolism is a challenging pathology commonly faced by emergency physicians, and diagnosis and management remain a crucial skill set. Inherent to the challenge is the breadth of presentation, ranging from asymptomatic pulmonary emboli to sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis and exclusion have evolved over time and now use a combination of clinical decision calculators and updates to the classic d-dimer cutoffs. Management of pulmonary emboli revolves around appropriate anticoagulation, which for most of the patients will comprise newer oral agents. However, there remains a substantial degree of practice variation and ambiguity when it comes to higher risk patients with submassive or massive pulmonary emboli.

There are several points that bear repetition. First, consider the diagnosis of PE in all patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, oxygen desaturation, or unexplained hypotension. Evaluate these patients in a rational manner. At any individual hospital, develop algorithms with consultants so that when one is faced with a patient with a PE, the flow of both diagnostics and therapeutics flows smoothly and rapidly. Consider the concept of risk stratification, and remember that not all patients with PE are created equal. In particular, be on the same page with all consultants regarding the use of right heart echocardiography, both for its potential diagnostic capabilities and for its ability to identify patients who could be at greater risk for bad outcomes.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

For a patient who has undergone CT imaging and has an incidental finding of chronic thromboembolism (webs and/or attenuated vessels), what should I do?

Strictly, CTEPD cannot be diagnosed until after 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. If there is an incidental finding of chronic, organised, fibrotic clot and the patient presents with breathlessness, we would recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with reassessment after 3 months. The decision with respect to long-term anticoagulation should be made on an individual basisand consider the risk of PE recurrence, the previous history of PE (if any) and the burden of organised clot seen on CTPA against the risk of potential bleed.

Patients who remain symptomatic at 3 months require further assessment. The first step would usually be an echocardiogram. If there is an intermediate or high probability of PH, then referral to a PH centre is recommended. If there is a low probability of PH, a CPET looking for an abnormal pulmonary vascular response patternshould be considered, or, if unfit to perform CPET, the authors suggest echocardiogram surveillance after a year. NT-proBNP can also help to stratify likelihood of having significant PH. Where patients have a low echocardiographic probability of PH and breathlessness is likely due to other factors, it may not be necessary to perform any further assessment. In cases where the probability of PH is unclear, a follow-up echocardiogram after an interval may be helpful.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### Pulmonary embolism: a clinician's perspective [^115PCfUt]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have both improved diagnostic accuracy as well as made management algorithms safer and more accessible. Physicians need to more frequently consider PE in patients with chest pain or dyspnea and should be aware of the proper diagnostic approach. Diagnostic strategies should include pretest clinical probability, D-dimer assays, and imaging tests. Although it has been proven that the use of algorithms result in better outcomes, there are patient-specific issues that must be considered. Approaches that use computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning appear equally safe, but each approach has advantages and disadvantages that should be appreciated to provide the best care. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating whether these diagnostic processes can be made even easier and less expensive. Importantly, patients at low risk with a negative D-dimer can avoid imaging tests and those at moderate risk with a negative high sensitivity D-dimer can have venous thromboembolism excluded without the need for imaging. However, these patients also represent those most likely to have false-positive tests and clinically irrelevant PE. V/Q scanning may be more appropriate in premenopausal women, in those with renal dysfunction or diabetes, in those with known contrast allergies, and perhaps in patients with known family history of breast cancer. As with any illness, there is room for improvement in the management of PE, but it remains unknown whether preventive measures, diagnosis, treatment modalities, or physician or patient education should be the focus.

### Pulmonary endarterectomy and lung resection achieving therapeutic success in rarely encountered large cavitary infarctions following pulmonary embolism: a case report [^1171f3ge]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is known to classically present with sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and potentially haemoptysis. It can infrequently lead to pulmonary infarction, which then rarely leads to pulmonary cavitation only in 4–5% of infarction cases according to autopsy studies. In addition to its non-classical presentation, our case also involved two cavitating lesions — one measuring 11.4 cm — both refractory to medical therapy and necessitating surgical intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the rare reported cases of pulmonary cavitations following pulmonary embolism where surgery was undertaken, and the first to involve pulmonary endarterectomy. This case report aims to describe the therapeutic potential of combining pulmonary endarterectomy and lung resection for treating rare cavitary infarctions secondary to pulmonary embolism.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

Pulmonary embolism can be acutely life-threatening and is associated with long-term consequences such as recurrent venous thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on the management of patients with venous thromboembolism. Here, a hematologist and a cardiology and vascular medicine specialist discuss these guidelines in the context of the care of a patient with pulmonary embolism. They discuss advanced therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis in the short-term management of patients with intermediate-risk disease, recurrence risk stratification at presentation, and ideal antithrombotic regimens for patients whose pulmonary embolism was associated with a transient minor risk factor.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^1137gdrS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

- What is the optimal timing for assessing outcomes after a diagnosis of acute PE?

Early assessment for adverse outcomes might improve decision making regarding outpatient therapy of PE and escalated PE-associated monitoring and therapy.

- What kind of relationship should prognostic outcomes have to the therapeutic and monitoring options?

Prognostication should accurately estimate all-cause mortality in patients undergoing consideration for outpatient therapy. Alternatively, prognostication should accurately estimate PE-related mortality and PE-related decompensation in patients undergoing consideration for disease-specific therapy.

- What is the operational definition of PE-associated deterioration?

PE-associated adverse outcomes include death, recurrent PE, RV dysfunction, end-organ hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and hypotension (and tachycardia).

- For patients with acute PE, how should clinicians accurately estimate the individual risk of patients for adverse outcomes?

Calculators could provide individual risk estimations that help guide the choice of available therapeutic options. Retrospective analyses of large registries' data could assist with the rapid development of new risk calculators. Prospective studies could assist with the development, validation, and revision of these tools and schemas at a slower pace and at a greater cost.

- What predictor variables should physicians consider and/or which prognostic tools should be included?

New risk calculators should include variables associated with medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and tests that assess for the presence and the degree of hypoxemia, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, clot burden, organ perfusion, and systemic inflammation.

- Which intervention(s) has or have the best risk/benefit ratio for distinct subgroups of patients with acute PE?

### The PERT concept: a step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^114BcDd9]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), developed with the European Respiratory Society, provide recommendations on the optimal management of acute PE, including diagnostic algorithms, risk stratification, initial and extended treatment, and follow-up strategy. Some important aspects of the treatment and overall care of patients after acute PE were mentioned, but their detailed discussion was beyond the scope of the guideline document. These issues relate to: management of bleeding risk, screening for cancer, screening for thrombophilia, treatment of PE in women, dealing with sports and travel, detection and management of the post-PE syndrome (PPES), and screening for and management of risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease. This position paper highlights these key aspects of patient counselling, summarizes best available evidence and provides guidance for clinical practice. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE that is intended to be complementary to the formal guideline. The rationale for the conclusions presented is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix. This review will not deal with PE and COVID-19, for which the reader is referred to the dedicated European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus document.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^112HiuRr]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing role of pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs)

The 2022 ESC consensus recommended the establishment of Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERTs) for defining treatment goals due to a growing body of evidence suggesting PERT activation to improve short- and mid-term mortality as well as readmission rates. These interdisciplinary teams of experts in cardiology, pulmonology, hematology, vascular medicine, intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery or interventional radiology are meant to offer specialized care for patients with elevated mortality risk and to provide centralized, spoke-like referral structures for regional healthcare providers. At a minimum, a PERT requires an interdisciplinary intensive care department, ideally experienced with extracorporeal life support systems, a 24/7 on-site radiology department, and interventionalists with 24/7 availability at least on an on-call basis. Starting with one intensive care unit, one interventional department, and one catheter-based procedure, respectively, helps to avoid structural redundancies and management inconsistencies. Once a center has developed a standardized protocol — from PERT activation, case discussion, feedback-driven individual case management to follow-up — additional local treatment teams, as well as external referrals, can be seamlessly integrated into the system. FDA-cleared and CE-certified artificial intelligence solutions for automated image interpretation and clinical data integration can help streamline PERT activation and reduce the time-to-consult, but at the same time, still bear the risk of automation bias and notification fatigue if false positive rates are unsatisfactory.

Besides risk stratification and procedural feasibility, part of a typical PERT discussion should be the individual patient's disposition to tolerate an intervention lying supine and breathing spontaneously. Converting an intermediate-high-risk patient into a high-risk patient during a procedure or by means of prior elective intubation is a significant danger. Hemodynamically deteriorating patients should be promptly evaluated for reperfusion strategies by the PERT team before progressing to overt cardiogenic shock. Based on evidence of better outcomes for early compared to delayed interventions, a decision for thrombectomy should entail its start within 60–90 min or 2–4 h following systemic lysis (Fig. 2).

The statement adds, "Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of dyspnea is the preferred and most direct approach to ameliorating this symptom, but there are many patients for whom the cause is unclear or for whom dyspnea persists despite optimal treatment".

### Contemporary management of acute pulmonary embolism [^1164k7pi]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple treatment options beyond anticoagulation exist for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism to reduce mortality. For some patients, systemic thrombolytics and catheter-directed thrombolysis are appropriate interventions. For others, surgical pulmonary embolectomy can be life-saving. Extracorporeal life support and right ventricular assist devices can provide hemodynamic support in challenging cases. We propose a management algorithm for the treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, in conjunction with a multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response team, to guide clinicians in individualizing treatment for patients in a timely manner.

### Interventional therapies for acute pulmonary embolism [^114pUEP6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist in outcome data around many interventional therapies, a fact that is reflected in the low strength of management recommendations found in consensus major society guidelines. In addition to careful risk stratification, therapeutic anticoagulation generally should be an early part of PE management in all cases. For patients presenting with acute high-risk PE or intermediate-risk PE with higher risk features, consideration should be given to systemic thrombolysis after careful evaluation for potential bleeding complications. In patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of this therapy, or significant ongoing cardiopulmonary distress, consideration should be given to interventional therapies like catheter-directed lysis, catheter-directed embolectomy, surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support. Until more robust comparative outcome data are put forward, pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) should be considered for multi-disciplinary patient evaluation and management.

### Treating large pulmonary emboli: do the guidelines guide us? [^111x9zwN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis and management of patients with large pulmonary emboli can be confusing. This review will summarize available data and suggest the areas of certainty and uncertainty in the treatment of these patients.

Recent Findings

Pulmonary emboli can be stratified according to patient prognosis. Risk-stratification of patients with submassive pulmonary emboli is still lacking. Similarly, although the treatment of low-risk pulmonary embolism is well established, and there is consensus regarding systemic thrombolysis for unstable patients with pulmonary embolism, the management of patients with submassive pulmonary embolism is still a matter of debate. The role of novel approaches such as low-dose thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies and advanced cardiopulmonary support is yet to be determined. Although some patients in skilled centers may benefit from pulmonary embolectomy, patient selection has yet to be refined.

Summary

The treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism has yet to be standardized. The complexity in choosing appropriate treatments for these patients is due to the lack of high-quality data compounded by an expanding arsenal of therapeutic options.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^114XjNFQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease. In the US, an estimated 40–53 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with PE annually and approximately 60,000 die from the disease. Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are non-specific; however, a quick and accurate diagnosis is critical because, with appropriate therapy, the risk of recurrent (and potentially fatal) PE can be greatly reduced. Recent publication of prediction rules and improved non-invasive diagnostic tools have simplified diagnostic algorithms for PE. The efficacy of the standard treatment for PE, initial administration of continuous i.v. unfractionated heparin overlapped with long-term oral anticoagulation, is well established. However, newer treatment options such as low-molecular-weight heparins and the pentasaccharides may offer similar efficacy with improved convenience.

### Emergencies and critical issues in Parkinson's disease [^115gX7uw]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People with Parkinson's disease may develop acute and subacute complications that are serious or even life-threatening, and require prompt medical attention. Some emergencies are intrinsic to the disease, while others result from an interaction of various medical and surgical treatments with the disease process. These conditions often present a diagnostic and management challenge.

Emergencies may result from motor deterioration, or there may be non-motor issues such as neuropsychiatric problems, autonomic dysfunction syndromes and sleep disorders. Occasionally patients need to be hospitalised and to receive multidisciplinary care. Boxes 1 and 2 provide illustrative examples, drawn from the literature and our experience.

Box 1
Illustrative case of parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome

A 73-year-old man with a 15-year history of Parkinson's disease was admitted for neurosurgical evacuation of traumatic subdural haematoma. His parkinsonism had deteriorated in the last 3 months despite high daily levodopa dosage (1200 mg). During the postoperative period, his bradykinesia and rigidity markedly worsened. There was no clear improvement despite increasing the levodopa in combination with dopamine agonists in several presentations (oral, transdermal and subcutaneous). He became confused, febrile and diaphoretic. On examination, he had marked generalised rigidity and bradykinesia. CT scan of head was normal. Other factors that may aggravate parkinsonism, such as addition of dopaminergic blockers, and concurrent medical conditions, were ruled out. Blood tests showed high muscle enzyme levels and markers of acute renal failure. Response to dopaminergic therapy remained minimal. He later developed shortness of breath and tachycardia. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed and he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Levodopa was administered via a nasogastric tube and intense physiotherapy implemented with gradual improvement of his health status although daily functioning was still significantly impaired despite continuous dopaminergic therapy.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

Methods

Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Current evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

Results

Management dilemmas discussed include: sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge and novel oral anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Massive pulmonary embolus and a precariously positioned thrombus: teetering on a knife edge! [^114ngwRP]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition seen regularly by emergency physicians. The authors describe a patient who presented with shortness of breath and syncope. He also experienced drowsy, clammy and sweaty episodes. He was tachycardic, tachypnoeic and saturating at 92% on air. A chest X-ray was normal but an ECG showed S1Q3T3. A CT pulmonary angiography performed showed bilateral pulmonary emboli with a large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus. Echocardiography revealed severely dilated right ventricle and atrium, severe right ventricular impairment, pulmonary hypertension, large mobile friable clots seen extending into the tricuspid valve. A multidisciplinary team decided the safest management approach was intravenous heparin. The patient recovered and repeat echocardiography 5 days later showed significantly smaller clots. The extension of an IVC thrombus into the heart and prolapsing into the tricuspid valve is an extremely rare presentation. Furthermore this case demonstrates the importance of echocardiography when diagnosing and generating bespoke management plans for PE.

### Sex differences in guideline-consistent diagnostic testing for acute pulmonary embolism among adult emergency department patients aged 18–49 [^111BfkVg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent diagnostic consideration in emergency department (ED) patients, yet diagnosis is challenging because symptoms of PE are nonspecific. Guidelines recommend the use of clinical decision tools to increase efficiency and avoid harms from overtesting, including D-dimer screening in patients not at high risk for PE. Women undergo testing for PE more often than men yet have a lower yield from testing. Our study objective was to determine whether patient sex influenced the odds of received guideline-consistent care.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study at two large U.S. academic EDs from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Nonpregnant patients aged 18-49years were included if they presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or syncope and underwent testing for PE with D-dimer or imaging. Demographic and clinical data were exported from the electronic medical record (EMR). Pretest risk scores were calculated using manually abstracted EMR data. Diagnostic testing was then compared with recommended testing based on pretest risk. The primary outcome was receipt of guideline-consistent care, which required an elevated screening D-dimer prior to imaging in all non-high-risk patients.

Results

We studied 1991 discrete patient encounters; 37% (735) of patients were male and 63% (1256) were female. Baseline characteristics, including revised Geneva scores, were similar between sexes. Female patients were more likely to receive guideline-consistent care (70% [874/1256] female vs. 63% [463/735] male, p < 0.01) and less likely to be diagnosed with PE (3.1% [39/1256] female vs. 5.3% [39/735] male, p < 0.05). The most common guideline deviation in both sexes was obtaining imaging without a screening D-dimer in a non-high-risk patient (75% [287/382] female vs. 75% [205/272] male).

Conclusions

In this cohort, females were more likely than males to receive care consistent with current guidelines and less likely to be diagnosed with PE.

### Outpatient management of patients following diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^112fvYG1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

While guidelines recommend outpatient management of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), little is known about the disposition of patients with PE diagnosed in United States emergency departments (EDs). We sought to determine disposition practices and subsequent health care utilization in patients with acute PE in U.S. EDs.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients with a new diagnosis of acute PE treated at 740 U.S. acute care hospitals from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2018. The primary outcome was the initial disposition following an ED visit for acute PE. Additional measures included hospital cost and 30-day revisit rate to the ED.

Results

A total of 61,070 cases were included in the overall cohort, of which 4.1% of new cases of PE were discharged from the ED. The median hospital-specific proportion of patients discharged was 3.1% (interquartile range = 0.8%-6.8%). The median odds ratio, representing the importance of the hospital in initial disposition decisions, was 2.21 (95% confidence interval = 2.05 to 2.37), which was greater than any patient-level factor with the exception of concurrent ED diagnosis of hypoxemia/respiratory failure, shock, or hypotension. Within 30 days of discharge, 17.9% of discharged cases had an ED return visit to the ED only and 10.3% of patients were hospitalized. Of the 30-day ED return visits in patients initially managed as outpatients, 1.3% had a bleeding-associated diagnosis.

Conclusion

Despite guidelines promoting outpatient management, few patients are currently discharged home in the United States; however, practice varies widely across hospitals. Return visit rates were high but most did not result in hospitalization.

Post-pulmonary embolism syndrome

The PPES is defined as new or progressive dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, and/or impaired functional or mental status after at least 3 months of adequate anticoagulation following acute PE, which cannot be explained by other (pre-existing) comorbidities. It is reported in up to 40–60% of PE survivors. Incomplete thrombus resolution occurs in 25–50% of patients after acute PE despite adequate anticoagulation, but bears no clinical significance in most cases. Notably, follow-up studies have shown that ∼40% of PE survivors have persistent perfusion defects, although only a very small proportion of these patients are ultimately diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the most severe clinical presentation of PPES. The prevalence of CTEPH in PE survivors is 2–3%, and 5–8% in PE survivors with persistent dyspnoea, but it is unclear whether CTEPH develops from acute PE, or presents as acute PE. Therefore, current guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up of asymptomatic PE patients by imaging methods, but suggest to evaluate the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of CTEPH.

### Use of heparin in aortic dissection: beware the misdiagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^114yUBC1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a case which highlights the diagnostic difficulties between a Stanford type A aortic dissection (AD) and a pulmonary embolism (PE) and the impact it has on subsequent management. A 75-year-old man presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness was initially suspected of having a PE and started on low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH). The patient was correctly diagnosed afterwards with CT of the chest to have an aortic dissection. The detrimental use of LMWH may have caused a propagation of the dissection and delayed surgical intervention of an acutely life-threatening condition. When the diagnosis is unclear, the early use of CT can help differentiate AD from PE. This in-turn can guide the management as well as the use of LMWH, which should be avoided until the correct diagnosis is confirmed.

A man in his 20s presented with severe left-sided chest pain, shortness of breath and acute confusion. Initial examination revealed central cyanosis, normal heart sounds, vesicular breath sounds in both lung fields and a bruised right calf. The patient reported that he had recently injured his right leg and that he had not taken medication prescribed for blood clots for several days. Peripheral oxygen saturations were 85% despite high flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed hypoxaemia. Given the history and the severe hypoxia, he was managed for pulmonary embolism initially. Closer inspection of his arterial blood results showed a methaemoglobin percentage of 20.4%. He was given intravenous methylene blue which resulted in resolution of his symptoms within 30 min. He subsequently confirmed that he was undergoing genetic testing for likely congenital methaemoglobinaemia.
