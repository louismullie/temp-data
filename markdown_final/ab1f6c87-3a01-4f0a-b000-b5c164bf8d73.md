## Question

What is first line antibiotic for uncomplicated uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line antibiotic choices for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women, including dosing, duration, alternatives, and stewardship considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition and scope of uncomplicated UTI. Then, I should verify the core first-line agents and their recommended regimens. Next, I will review comparative effectiveness and safety, including resistance and adverse events. After that, I need to check when to avoid certain agents and what to use instead. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation and stewardship tools, and synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats and follow-up expectations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't conflate uncomplicated cystitis with pyelonephritis or complicated infection. Uncomplicated UTI in women is typically acute bacterial cystitis in immunocompetent, nonpregnant, noncatheterized adults without systemic illness or structural abnormalities, where empiric therapy based on symptoms is acceptable and cultures are not routinely required for initial episodes [^1132xnmk].

> I will now examine the core first-line agents and their standard regimens. Wait, let me verify the dosing and durations across contemporary guidelines to avoid outdated or inconsistent recommendations. The IDSA-endorsed first-line options are nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days when local resistance is below 20%, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g as a single dose, with pivmecillinam 200–400 mg three times daily for 3–7 days as an additional option where available [^117PqarS] [^116hPLMo] [^113B1ky2]. Hold on, I should verify the nitrofurantoin duration; I initially thought 7 days was standard, but current guidance supports 5 days for uncomplicated cystitis, which aligns with efficacy and stewardship goals [^117PqarS] [^1122cGCL].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and safety to prioritize among these options. Let me consider contemporary effectiveness data first. Large observational analyses using causal inference methods show that guideline-concordant first-line therapy (nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX) has lower 30-day revisit rates than fluoroquinolones and substantially lower revisit rates than beta-lactams, supporting the durability of IDSA recommendations in modern practice [^11166m3B] [^114FurQs]. I need to check adverse event profiles as well; compared with nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX is associated with higher risks of hypersensitivity, acute renal failure, rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas non–first-line agents carry higher risks of microbiome-related adverse events such as C. difficile and vaginal candidiasis, reinforcing the preference for narrow-spectrum first-line choices [^1142QscD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TMP-SMX without anchoring to resistance thresholds. I should confirm the local resistance caveat: TMP-SMX should be avoided empirically when local E. coli resistance exceeds about 20%, given the association with worse outcomes and stewardship concerns, so checking the local antibiogram is essential before choosing it [^117PqarS] [^113bqtGg]. Let me also verify the resistance dynamics of nitrofurantoin; despite widespread use, resistance remains low, likely due to a high barrier to resistance, which strengthens its role as a preferred empiric agent in many settings [^111ptg8h].

> I need to ensure I address agents to avoid or deprioritize. Fluoroquinolones should not be first-line for uncomplicated cystitis because of ecological harm, selection for multidrug resistance, and serious adverse effects reflected in FDA boxed warnings; they are reserved for patients who cannot use first-line agents or when susceptibility is assured, aligning with both IDSA and AAFP positions [^117PqarS] [^116Q9Kvw] [^111fdQLH]. But wait, what about beta-lactams? They are generally less effective than first-line agents and are associated with higher failure and revisit rates, so they should be considered inferior alternatives rather than routine empiric choices for uncomplicated cystitis [^11166m3B] [^117PqarS].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy, nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are commonly used with attention to gestational timing and local resistance, while fosfomycin is an alternative; in men with suspected cystitis, longer treatment durations are typical and culture-guided therapy is prudent, with 7 days commonly recommended in afebrile men, though I should confirm that this is a guideline-supported duration in contemporary summaries [^1132xnmk] [^114KyjDw]. For recurrent UTI, principles remain aligned with first-line agents and short courses, with culture-directed adjustments when episodes fail or resistance risk is high, and with explicit emphasis on minimizing collateral damage and duration whenever feasible [^113zoJEq] [^117R5hjq].

> Next, I should review implementation and stewardship tools that influence real-world prescribing. Audit-and-feedback interventions and multimodal education reduce second-line prescribing and increase first-line use without increasing complications, and machine learning–assisted decision support can further reduce inappropriate broad-spectrum choices while maintaining outcomes, which is highly actionable for health systems [^1162UrQM] [^111RMPhH] [^1169q5bN]. I should double-check that these behavioral strategies are supported by randomized and quasi-experimental data; yes, cluster RCTs and pragmatic trials demonstrate sustained improvements in guideline-concordant prescribing when paired with local resistance data and repeated feedback [^1162UrQM] [^1169q5bN].

> I will now synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation, but I need to ensure it reflects both evidence and local context. For most nonpregnant women with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days is an excellent first choice given high effectiveness, low resistance, and favorable safety; TMP-SMX for 3 days is reasonable when local resistance is below 20% and there is no sulfa allergy; fosfomycin 3 g once is a valid alternative, acknowledging somewhat lower efficacy but minimal resistance and collateral damage; pivmecillinam is an additional option where available, typically 200–400 mg three times daily for 3–7 days, with attention to local availability and resistance patterns [^117PqarS] [^116hPLMo] [^113B1ky2]. Hold on, I should verify that this hierarchy aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, multiple high-quality sources converge on these choices and durations, with explicit cautions to avoid fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams as routine empiric therapy [^117PqarS] [^113bqtGg].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and contingency planning are clear. If symptoms persist beyond about 3–7 days, I should obtain a urine culture and reassess for resistant organisms, atypical pathogens, or alternative diagnoses. This is especially important in recurrent presentations or treatment failures, and it aligns with stewardship principles to avoid empiric escalation without data [^1132xnmk] [^113EKioz]. Let me reconsider whether delayed antibiotics or NSAID-only strategies are reasonable; while some trials explored symptomatic management, the balance of evidence favors antibiotics for faster symptom resolution and lower risk of progression, so any non-antibiotic approach should be framed as shared decision-making with safety-netting rather than routine care [^112m772W] [^1123zsv2].

---

The first-line antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI are **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days** [^117PqarS] [^116hPLMo], **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days** (if local resistance ≤ 20%) [^117PqarS] [^111fdQLH], and **fosfomycin 3 g PO single dose** [^117PqarS] [^116hPLMo]. These agents are recommended for their **high efficacy, low resistance, and favorable safety profiles** [^111fdQLH] [^1142QscD]. Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are not first-line due to higher resistance, greater adverse effects, and broader ecological impact [^117PqarS] [^1142QscD] [^111fdQLH]. Treatment should be guided by local resistance data and patient-specific factors [^113bqtGg] [^116uTTsD].

## Recommended first-line antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg PO BID for 5 days | - Highly effective <br/> - Low resistance <br/> - Avoid if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^117PqarS] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days | - Use only if local resistance ≤ 20% [^117PqarS] [^113bqtGg] |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g PO single dose | - Convenient single-dose regimen <br/> - Low resistance <br/> - Slightly lower efficacy than nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX [^117PqarS] |

---

## Antibiotics not recommended as first-line therapy

- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)**: Effective but associated with significant adverse effects (e.g. tendon rupture, QT prolongation, CNS effects) and high ecological impact; reserve for cases with no suitable alternatives [^116Q9Kvw] [^111fdQLH].

- **Beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime)**: Lower efficacy and higher rates of adverse effects compared to first-line agents; use only when first-line options are unsuitable [^114FurQs] [^112ZuMBn].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Local resistance patterns**: Critical in selecting empiric therapy; avoid TMP-SMX if local resistance > 20% [^117PqarS] [^113bqtGg].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Allergies, renal function, pregnancy status, and prior antibiotic use should guide selection [^111s2fcA] [^111xwYMR].

- **Patient preferences**: Consider convenience, dosing frequency, and potential side effects [^114PmJ6k].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profiles

- **Nitrofurantoin**: High clinical and microbiological cure rates; minimal resistance; favorable safety profile [^117PqarS] [^1142QscD].

- **TMP-SMX**: Effective when resistance is low; monitor for hypersensitivity and hematologic side effects [^117PqarS] [^1142QscD].

- **Fosfomycin**: Convenient single-dose regimen; moderate efficacy; low resistance [^117PqarS] [^113mosax].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from IDSA, AAFP, and ACP consistently recommend **nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin** as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI, emphasizing **short-course regimens**, local resistance considerations, and patient-specific factors [^117PqarS] [^116hPLMo] [^1122cGCL].

---

## Emerging therapies and recent developments

Gepotidacin, a novel oral antibiotic, has recently shown **non-inferiority to nitrofurantoin** in clinical trials and may provide an additional first-line option pending regulatory approval [^112sRKie]. Pivmecillinam has also been approved in some regions and offers a narrow-spectrum alternative with low resistance potential [^117PqarS] [^114NDdVN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin remain the **first-line antibiotics** for uncomplicated UTI, with selection guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors. Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are not recommended as first-line therapy due to safety concerns and lower efficacy.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^11797t3a]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, imaging and conservative management of urinary tract infections based on the peer-reviewed literature of the last year.

Recent Findings

It has been estimated that 3% of prepubertal girls and 1% of prepubertal boys are diagnosed with urinary tract infections. Breastfeeding has been shown to offer significant protection against urinary tract infection in infants. Any young child with an acute pyelonephritis should be evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to confirm or rule out renal scarring. The voiding cystourethrogram can be performed within the first 7 days of diagnosis. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporin are the first-line antibiotics to treat children with uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

Summary

The incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy and childhood is high and influenced by the age and sex of the patient. Voiding cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan are required for imaging. Short-course treatment is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113bqtGg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I2 = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I2 = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I2 = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I2 = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

Background

Little is known about the relative harms of different antibiotic regimens prescribed to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). We sought to compare the risk of adverse events associated with commonly used oral antibiotic regimens for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Methods

Using data from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, we identified 1 169 033 otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18–44 years with uncomplicated UTI who initiated an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2015. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the association between antibiotic agent and adverse events.

Results

Of 2 first-line agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (vs nitrofurantoin) was associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events including hypersensitivity reaction (hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–2.98), acute renal failure (2.56; 1.55–4.25), skin rash (2.42; 2.13–2.75), urticaria (1.37; 1.19–1.57), abdominal pain (1.14; 1.09–1.19), and nausea/vomiting (1.18; 1.10–1.28), but a similar risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events. Compared with nitrofurantoin, non-first-line agents were associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related adverse events including non-Clostridium difficile diarrhea, C. difficile infection, vaginitis/vulvovaginal candidiasis, and pneumonia. Treatment duration modified the risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events.

Conclusions

The risks of adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related events differ widely by antibiotic agent and duration. These findings underscore the utility of using real-world data to fill evidentiary gaps related to antibiotic safety.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^11166m3B]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common indication for outpatient antimicrobial therapy. National guidelines for the management of uncomplicated UTI were published in 2011, but the extent to which they align with current practices, patient diversity, and pathogen biology, all of which have evolved greatly in the time since their publication, is not fully known.

Objective

To reevaluate the effectiveness and adverse event profile for first-line antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and oral β-lactams for treating uncomplicated UTI in contemporary clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, population-based cohort study used a claims dataset from Independence Blue Cross, which contains inpatient, outpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy claims that occurred between 2012 and 2021, formatted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Participants were nonpregnant female individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, nonrecurrent UTI at an outpatient setting. Patients must also have been treated with first-line (nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin), or oral β-lactam (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefadroxil, or cefpodoxime) antibiotics. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to August 2024.

Exposures

Patients exposed to first-line antibiotics were assigned to the treatment group, and those exposed to fluoroquinolone or β-lactam treatments were assigned to control groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite end point for treatment failure, defined as outpatient or inpatient revisit within 30 days for UTI, pyelonephritis, or sepsis. Secondary outcomes were the risk of 4 common antibiotic-associated adverse events: gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Results

There were 57 585 episodes of UTI among 49 037 female patients (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [20.1]) years), with prescriptions for first-line antibiotics in 35 018 episodes (61%), fluoroquinolones in 21 140 episodes (37%), and β-lactams in 1427 episodes (2%). After adjustment, receipt of first-line therapies was associated with an absolute risk difference of -1.78% (95% CI, -2.37% to -1.06%) for having a revisit for UTI within 30 days of diagnosis vs fluoroquinolones. First-line therapies were associated with an absolute risk difference of -6.40% (95% CI, -10.14% to -3.24%) for 30-day revisit compared with β-lactam antibiotics. Differences in adverse events were similar between all comparators. Results were identical for models built with an automated OMOP feature extraction package.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with uncomplicated UTI derived from a large regional claims dataset, national treatment guidelines published almost 14 years ago continue to recommend optimal treatments. These results also provide proof-of-principle that automated feature extraction methods for OMOP formatted data can emulate manually curated models, thereby promoting reproducibility and generalizability.

### Antibiotic stewardship and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and adolescents in the emergency department of a community hospital [^116ZCZci]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A retrospective, cross-sectional study of children with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) 3 months to 18 years of age who had a urinalysis and urine culture (UC) during an emergency department (ED) visit between 2019 and 2020 was performed. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and independent samples T tests were used as appropriate. Median age was 6.6 years (interquartile range = 3.3–12.4). Urinalysis positivity was 92.8%, of which 81.9% of children were prescribed a first-line antibiotic. First-line antibiotic use was 82.7%. Positive UC rate was 84.7%, with 84% receiving a first-line antibiotic (P = .025). The correlation between a positive urinalysis and a positive UC was 80.8% (P < .001). Change of antibiotics based on the uropathogen of positive UCs was 6.3% (P < .001). The urinalysis and UC guided the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs. First-line antibiotics can be safely administered in the ED and prescribed for positive urinalyses. Studies are needed to evaluate the discontinuation of antibiotics with negative UCs as part of antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### The effect of antibiotic selection on collateral effects and evolvability of uropathogenic [^116GQueK]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the fourth most common infection requiring antibiotic treatment, with over 404 million cases and 236,790 deaths being estimated globally in 2019. UTIs are a significant economic burden resulting in > 6 billion dollars (~$ 18 per person in the US) in direct health care costs globally each year. Importantly, in Europe, there were 48,700 deaths attributed to antimicrobial-resistant UTIs in 2019.

The predominant cause of UTIs is Escherichia coli, with a prevalence of 75% in uncomplicated UTIs. UTIs caused by E. coli are associated with high levels of recurrence of infection (40%), and ~40–52.6% of patients with E. coli bacteraemia are thought to have a urinary source. Currently, the recommended first-line antibiotics to treat uncomplicated UTIs in the UK are trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for 3–5 days. If there is no improvement in symptoms after initial treatment, second-line antibiotics such as pivmecillinam or fosfomycin are recommended. However, a high prevalence of resistance has been identified in pathogens causing UTIs, as found by the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR). The report found that in 2018, 31.9% of all bacterial isolates from UTI samples were resistant to trimethoprim, while 11.7% were resistant to nitrofurantoin and 7.9% were resistant to fosfomycin. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not normally performed in primary care for UTIs prior to prescribing antibiotics, and with the insufficient development of novel antimicrobials continuing, there is a requirement to develop new strategies to maintain efficacy in current antibiotics and optimise their use.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Selecting an antibiotic for acute UTI in women… [^112DC7dv]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women can be treated effectively with a one- to three-day course of antibiotics. However, the effectiveness of various regimens has not been well-studied. McCarty and colleagues compared the safety and efficacy of a three-day course of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute UTI in women. Women with a diagnosis of acute uncomplicated UTI were eligible for the multicenter trial if they had a urine culture with at least 10. 3 colony-forming units per mL of urine, pyuria, dysuria and urinary frequency. Exclusion criteria included bacteriuria, urinary tract obstruction, neurogenic bladder or multiple causative organisms. Those who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive a three-day course of either 100 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily, 200 mg of ofloxacin twice daily or 160/800 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily.

Escherichia coli was identified as the most common pathogen, affecting 81 percent of patients. Overall, the bacteriologic and clinical response rates were similar in all groups. All isolates of E. coli responded to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, and only 6 percent were resistant to TMP/SMX. Bacteria were eradicated in 94 percent of patients in the ciprofloxacin group, 97 percent in the ofloxacin group and 92 percent in the TMP/SMX group. Symptoms resolved in more than 90 percent of patients in all groups by the end of the treatment period. Recurrence occurred after four to six weeks in only 61 patients, with most instances of recurrence caused by E. coli and affecting patients in the TMP/SMX group. Adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances, rash and fever, occurred more commonly in the ofloxacin and TMP/SMX groups than in the ciprofloxacin group.

The authors conclude that each of the antibiotic regimens tested was effective in treating acute uncomplicated UTI in women. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are more expensive than TMP/SMX, but their side effect profiles are better. Because of increasing prevalence of TMP/SMX–resistant. E. coli, the use of fluoroquinolones, especially in areas where this resistance is common, may be indicated.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### A decision algorithm to promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship for uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111RMPhH]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, which begets further resistance. This vicious cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects one in two women during their life and is associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high rates of prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents. To address this, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and built a decision algorithm for recommending the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible. When applied to a test cohort of 3629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. At the same time, it reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy, defined as the choice of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant, by 18% relative to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians chose a second-line drug but the algorithm chose a first-line drug, 92% (1066 of 1157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the first-line drug. When clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm chose an appropriate first-line drug 47% (183 of 392) of the time. Our machine learning decision algorithm provides antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse populations.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line therapy, ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to initiate any of the following regimens as first-line therapy in female patients with uncomplicated cystitis:

- nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID for 5 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage and efficacy compared to 3 days of TMP/SMX

- TMP/SMX 160/800 mg BID for 3 days, if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis are < 20% or if the infecting strain is known to be susceptible

- fosfomycin trometamol 3 g in a single dose, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it appears to have inferior efficacy compared with standard short-course regimens

- pivmecillinam (in regions where it is available) 400 mg BID for 3–7 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it may have inferior efficacy compared with other available therapies.

### Effects of a multimodal intervention in primary care to reduce second line antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections in women: parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial [^1162UrQM]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether a multimodal intervention in general practice reduces the proportion of second line antibiotic prescriptions and the overall proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

Design

Parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial.

Setting

General practices in five regions in Germany. Data were collected between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022.

Participants

General practitioners from 128 randomly assigned practices.

Interventions

Multimodal intervention consisting of guideline recommendations for general practitioners and patients, provision of regional data for antibiotic resistance, and quarterly feedback, which included individual first line and second line proportions of antibiotic prescribing, benchmarking with regional or supra-regional practices, and telephone counselling. Participants in the control group received no information on the intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was the proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed by general practices, in relation to all antibiotics prescribed, for uncomplicated urinary tract infections after one year between the intervention and control group. General practices were randomly assigned in blocks (1:1), with a block size of four, into the intervention or control group using SAS version 9.4; randomisation was stratified by region. The secondary outcome was the prescription proportion of all antibiotics, relative within all cases (instances of UTI diagnosis), for the treatment of urinary tract infections after one year between the groups. Adverse events were assessed as exploratory outcomes.

Results

110 practices with full datasets identified 10323 cases during five quarters (ie, 15 months). The mean proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed was 0.19 (standard deviation 0.20) in the intervention group and 0.35 (0.25) in the control group after 12 months. After adjustment for preintervention proportions, the mean difference was -0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.21 to -0.06, P < 0.001). The overall proportion of all antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections over 12 months was 0.74 (standard deviation 0.22) in the intervention and 0.80 (0.15) in the control group with a mean difference of -0.08 (95% confidence interval -0.15 to -0.02, P < 0.029). No differences were noted in the number of complications (ie, pyelonephritis, admission to hospital, or fever) between the groups.

Conclusions

The multimodal intervention in general practice significantly reduced the proportion of second line antibiotics and all antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

### Reappraisal of the treatment duration of antibiotic regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult women: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 61 randomised clinical trials [^117No2kf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence from numerous randomised clinical trials suggest that shorter-term antimicrobial therapy is as effective as-and has other advantages over-longer-term antimicrobial regimens at achieving symptomatic cure for acute uncomplicated cystitis. Nevertheless, not all shorter regimens are adopted in clinical guidelines. This study was done to reappraise the treatment duration of each antibiotic in current guidelines for acute uncomplicated cystitis to investigate whether the regimen lengths of guideline approved antibiotics could be reduced.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant publications from inception of the databases until Dec 31, 2019. Only randomised clinical trials of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis that assessed antibiotic therapy and reported clinical or microbial response outcome values were included. A network meta-analysis was done and the quality of evidence of all of the included studies was rated. Clinical response was the primary outcome, defined as the complete disappearance of all baseline symptoms at the test-of-cure visit. Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes was used to compare the efficacy of each antibiotic treatment regimen directly and indirectly. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018093529.

Findings

Overall, 61 randomised clinical trials-which included 20780 patients-were assessed in our systematic review. For the third-generation and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, a 3-day regimen had similar effect to a single-dose regimen for clinical response (risk ratio [RR] 0·994 [95% credible interval 0·939–1·052] vs 1·024 [0·974–1·083]), with moderate quality of evidence. For pivmecillinam, 5-day and 7-day regimens were similar to a 3-day regimen for clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence (RR 1·041 [0·910–1·193] for the 5-day regimen and 1·095 [0·999–1·203] for the 7-day regimen). Meanwhile, for third-generation cephalosporins and amoxicillin and clavulanate, there was no difference between single-dose and 3-day regimens, but quality of evidence supporting this conclusion was low. For second-generation quinolones and co-trimoxazole, single-dose regimen was less effective than 3-day regimen in clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence.

Interpretation

Treatment duration of the third-generation and fourth-generation quinolones and pivmecillinam could be shorter than the currently recommended regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For other antibiotics, shorter duration of regimens could be considered, but further research is needed because of the low quality of supporting evidence.

Funding

None.

NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND NEW USES FOR OLD ANTIBIOTICS

Urinary Tract Infections

Due to antibiotic resistance and contraindications that sometimes limit the use of current first-line agents, there is room for new options in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, the results of 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3, were published in February 2024. These nearly identical trials tested gepotidacin, an oral, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication by binding 2 different topoisomerases at a binding site distinct from fluoroquinolones. Geopotidacin was compared with nitrofurantoin by randomizing female patients over the age of 12 years with uncomplicated UTIs to receive 1 of the 2 drugs for 5 days. The primary outcome was therapeutic success, which was a combination of clinical and microbiologic resolution at day 10–13. Gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin in terms of the primary outcome in EAGLE-2, while it was superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. Notably, these differences were driven mostly by higher rates of microbiologic failure in the nitrofurantoin groups, as clinical success rates were relatively similar between the 2 arms. Gepotidacin has been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and a decision regarding its approval is expected in 2025.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^116kWawM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly diagnosed infections, and prior studies have reported discordance in antibiotic treatment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

Objective

To assess IDSA guideline concordance rates for women with uncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics, and compare concordance rates between different specialty field.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cross-sectional study of health care claims data from the US Military Health System Data Repository, which contains comprehensive health care encounter and claims data for all military beneficiaries. Participants were adult women between the ages of 18 to 50 years with uncomplicated UTIs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Data extraction and analysis were performed in 2022. Patients with diagnosis of UTI in the preceding 6 months, current pregnancy, history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of organ transplant, history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, or history of urologic procedures were excluded.

Exposures

Antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. Only antibiotics received within 1 day after the diagnosis were analyzed. The IDSA recommends the following antibiotics as first-line therapy: nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The IDSA guideline concordance rates were calculated as the number of patients receiving first-line antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

A total of 46 793 adult women (67.3% [31 475 of 46 793] aged 18–34 years; 38.2% [31 475 of 46 793] of White race) were diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs with 91.0% receiving guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. In comparison with obstetrics and gynecology, IDSA guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in internal medicine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.73–3.03), family medicine (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.76–1.87), surgery (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.36–1.67), and emergency medicine (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.32–1.39) and less likely in urology (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38–0.43). Compared with direct military care, private sector care had lower concordance rates (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62–0.64).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of antibiotic treatments for uncomplicated UTIs in a universally insured population, the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was high at 91.0% with higher rates in direct military care compared with private sector care. There were higher rates in general medical specialties, surgery, and emergency medicine and lower rates in urology and obstetrics and gynecology. These results further enhance the literature on current antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^111QdpPd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in outpatients and result in substantial morbidity and healthcare costs. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the primary causal agent of UTIs. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing practices, such as the overuse of broad-spectrum agents, have contributed to the rise of antimicrobial resistance making effective treatment more challenging. The increasing resistance of uropathogens to commonly prescribed antibiotics necessitates a shift towards alternatives with a narrower spectrum and lower regional resistance rates, such as nitrofurantoin. Since empiric antibiotic recommendations are guided by local resistance rates, audit and feedback (AF) interventions have gained attention as a strategy to address regional knowledge gaps and support clinician behavioural change.

In a systematic review of physician-targeted interventions for the management of UTIs, small trials of written and in-person AF, sometimes paired with education, show promise; however, the largest trial which involved in-person workshops had an almost 50% opt-out rate did not improve antibiotic selection statistically and faced barriers in spread. None of these trials included individualised feedback with local or regional comparisons. Peer comparison AF interventions have shown promise in improving healthcare provider performance and enhancing guideline adherence. In the context of encouraging family physicians (FPs) to prescribe nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for uncomplicated lower UTIs, a mail-based programme of personalised prescribing AF comparing an individual physician's practice with their peers coupled with educational summaries (ESs), may offer a valuable strategy to improve appropriate antibiotic use. Because receiving AF multiple times is more effective than one instance and there remains uncertainty as to which measures could improve the durability of the effect of AF, we sought to test one form of repeated intervention. We present an evaluation of a cluster-randomised trial that explores the impact of permutations of mailing AF including peer-comparison and an ES promoting the appropriate use of nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for UTIs.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They review the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, spending some time discussing the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice. The treatment section reviews the current recommendations and also highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors also discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Pivmecillinam for uncomplicated acute cystitis: a contemporary review [^113B1ky2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and discuss use of pivmecillinam in uncomplicated acute cystitis.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed (from 2000 through August 2024) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, such as mecillinam or pivmecillinam and urinary tract infections, were utilized. Additional references were identified by reviewing literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles were limited to English language publications evaluating the efficacy or safety of pivmecillinam for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult populations.

Data Synthesis

Data from 6 randomized controlled trials support pivmecillinam for acute uncomplicated cystitis at doses of 200 to 400 mg 3 times daily for 3 to 7 days, with more consistent clinical and bacteriologic cure observed with 400 mg doses and longer therapy durations. Clinical evaluation of 400 mg 2 to 3 times daily is available with use more common in non-US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved populations, such as men, pregnancy, and multidrug resistant infections. There are limited data supporting pivmecillinam for pyelonephritis; routine use is cautioned until further clinical data are available. Relevance to patient care and clinical practice in comparison with existing drugs:As resistance to first-line antimicrobials rises, the need for safe and effective treatment options remains high. Pivmecillinam represents a new therapeutic option available in the United States for outpatient management of uncomplicated acute cystitis.

Conclusion

Pivmecillinam could be a key agent for uncomplicated acute cystitis. Utilization will likely be cost driven, but the promise of low resistance encourages the place in therapy when other agents are not susceptible to infecting uropathogens.

Interventions

AF: The first page of the confidential personalised prescribing tool shows 2019–2020 first-line prescribing patterns for oral antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated lower UTI and the current recommendations for BC. The primary recommendation is to choose nitrofurantoin for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI. A second message recommends choosing fosfomycin as first-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate nitrofurantoin due to allergy or have impaired renal function. A final recommendation advises against prescribing ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and other antibiotics as first-line empiric therapy due to bacterial resistance rates in BC and adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Each message is accompanied by a bar chart depicting the physicians' individual prescribing compared with the average BC FP. The second page of the AF provides supporting evidence for why nitrofurantoin is recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI including a graph of 10-year history of E. coli isolates resistance rates by an antibiotic agent from the BC Centre for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Dashboard. It shows escalating resistance to cephalexin over 50%, relative stability of∼40% resistance to amoxicillin, ∼20% resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX and low or declining < 10% resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This makes it visually obvious which antibiotic is least likely to be resisted.

The evidence summary describes antimicrobial best practices for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated lower UTI in BC. It recommends diagnosing uncomplicated UTI based on patient symptoms and against routine use of a urine dipstick/urinalysis or urine culture for diagnosing as testing abnormalities increase with age. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin (Macrobid 100 mg two times a day or Macrodantin 50 mg four times a day) for 5–7 days is recommended with fosfomycin recommended as an alternative when there is an allergy or intolerance to nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are unsuitable for empiric therapy (unguided by susceptibility profile) in BC due to bacterial resistance. See onlinesupplemental files 1 2 for the sample AF and ES.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^1123zsv2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

We have to reject the hypothesis of non-inferiority of initial symptomatic treatment, and we cannot generally recommend the ibuprofen first approach. This treatment option, however, can be discussed with women with mild to moderate symptoms in a shared decision making approach or within a strategy of delayed prescription. Future research is needed to identify patients for whom symptomatic treatment is sufficient as it has the potential to considerably reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for women with mild to moderate symptoms of urinary tract infection, in particular those with negative results on culture.

### The expanding role of fluoroquinolones [^111SR2jC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing rate of resistance among common urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to traditional antimicrobial therapies including the "gold standard" trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Consequently, fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have taken on an expanding management role for UTIs. In fact, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical management guidelines for UTI recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in areas where resistance is likely to be of concern. Fluoroquinolones have demonstrated high bacteriologic and clinical cure rates, as well as low rates of resistance, among most common uropathogens. There are currently 7 fluoroquinolones with indications for UTI in the United States. However, only 3 are commonly used: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, gatifloxacin. Many of the fluoroquinolone agents have once-daily dosing regimens, enhancing patient adherence. In addition, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have same-dose bioequivalency between their intravenous and oral formulations, allowing for "switch" or step-down therapy from parenteral to oral formulations of the same agent at the same dose. Fluoroquinolones are indicated for the management of acute uncomplicated UTIs, as well as complicated and severe UTI and pyelonephritis, in adults. They are the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or TMP, who live in geographic areas with known resistance > 10% to 20% to TMP-SMX, or who have risk factors for such resistance. Fluoroquinolone properties include a broad spectrum of coverage, low rates of resistance, and good safety profiles.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117R5hjq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I2 = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I2 = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I2 = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I2 = 0%).

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^111wiGoG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111ptg8h]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, using a large, contemporary clinical dataset, we demonstrate that IDSA guidelines for treatment of uncomplicated UTI remain robust in terms of both effectiveness and adverse events, despite major changes in the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Unless a patient has a history of drug resistance or intolerance or lives in a region where local rates of resistance are high, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain the treatments of choice. We replicated our domain expert–derived results with an automated feature building package applied to a common data model, thereby supporting the hypothesis that complex causal inference analyses combined with careful cohort selection can be semiautomatable. This will help promote reproducibility of our findings in other health systems and opens inquiry into other important clinical questions.

We observed a small increase in rates of revisits for patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy compared with those receiving first-line antibiotics. This result is surprising because fluoroquinolones are thought to be equivalent or superior to nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in terms of clinical effectiveness. The differences were limited to outpatients with a diagnosis of lower UTI and were much less pronounced for inpatients, suggesting that the benefit of first-line treatments is restricted to classic presentations of uncomplicated UTI. Follow-up visits soon after treatment may be the result of drug intolerance, toxic effects, or selection of a drug to which an organism is resistant. The latter may be a possible explanation for why people treated with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had fewer revisits. Recent workhas suggested that rates of resistance to nitrofurantoin remain low, despite its widespread use, and may be due to a high barrier to resistance. Although resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more common, clinicians are less likely to use this drug on the basis of IDSA guidancethat recommends avoiding it when rates of local resistance exceed 20%, which is a common scenario throughout the US. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones is most often mediated by the accumulation of variants in a single gene, often in response to antibiotic exposure. Given the high rate of fluoroquinolone prescription in the community, this may increase the risk for prescribing an agent to which the organism is resistant. This is further complicated by the fact that uncomplicated UTI is often managed over telephone and without culture data. Finally, given that prescribers are prone to prescribe the same antibiotic, the impact of prior exposure may be more likely to lead to selection of resistance if that antibiotic is a fluoroquinolone and the patients are otherwise healthy outpatients with a low risk for colonization by drug-resistant organisms.

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections in outpatient settings [^111USGGi]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine if a multicomponent intervention was associated with increased use of first-line antibiotics (cephalexin or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) among children with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in outpatient settings.

Methods

The study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a large health care organization with ∼127000 members < 18 years of age. After conducting a gap analysis, an intervention was developed to target key drivers of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric UTIs. Intervention activities included development of new local clinical guidelines, a live case-based educational session, pre- and postsession e-mailed knowledge assessments, and a new UTI-specific order set within the electronic health record. Most activities were implemented on April 26, 2017. The study design was an interrupted time series comparing antibiotic prescribing for UTIs before versus after the implementation date. Infants < 60 days old and children with complex urologic or neurologic conditions were excluded.

Results

During January 2014 to September 2018, 2142 incident outpatient UTIs were identified (1636 preintervention and 506 postintervention). Pyelonephritis was diagnosed for 7.6% of cases. Adjusted for clustering of UTIs within clinicians, the proportion of UTIs treated with first-line antibiotics increased from 43.4% preintervention to 62.4% postintervention (P < .0001). The use of cephalexin (first-line, narrow spectrum) increased from 28.9% preintervention to 53.0% postintervention (P < .0001). The use of cefixime (second-line, broad spectrum) decreased from 17.3% preintervention to 2.6% postintervention (P < .0001). Changes in prescribing practices persisted through the end of the study period.

Conclusions

A multicomponent intervention with educational and process-improvement elements was associated with a sustained change in antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated pediatric UTIs.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^111D3x2q]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the impact of a personalised audit and feedback prescribing report (AF) and brief educational summary (ES) on empiric treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) by family physicians (FPs).

Design

Cluster randomised control trial.

Setting

The intervention was conducted in British Columbia, Canada between 23 September 2021 and 28 March 2022.

Participants

We randomised 5073 FPs into a standard AF and ES intervention arm (n = 1691), an ES-only arm (n = 1691) and a control arm (n = 1691).

Interventions

The AF contained personalised and peer-comparison data on first-line antibiotic prescriptions for women with uncomplicated lower UTI and key therapeutic recommendations. The ES contained detailed, evidence-based UTI management recommendations, incorporated regional antibiotic resistance data and recommended nitrofurantoin as a first-line treatment.

Main outcome measures

Nitrofurantoin as first-line pharmacological treatment for uncomplicated lower UTI, analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.

Results

We identified 21 307 cases of uncomplicated lower UTI among the three trial arms during the study period. The impact of receiving both the AF and ES increased the relative probability of prescribing nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for uncomplicated lower UTI by 28% (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.52), relative to the delay arm. This translates to additional prescribing of nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment, instead of alternates, in an additional 8.7 cases of uncomplicated UTI per 100 FPs during the 6-month study period.

Conclusion

AF prescribing data with educational materials can improve primary care prescribing of antibiotics for uncomplicated lower UTI.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) microbiome and non-antibiotic approaches — emerging data highlight the role of host microbial communities and the need for alternatives to antibiotics: "Emerging data regarding the bacterial communities of the human bladder, bowel, and vagina suggests that depletion or alteration of the normal host microbiome may disrupt host innate barriers to infection and alter innate immune system function, contributing to the development of rUTI", and "Such disruptions in these communities may be the direct consequence of antibiotic treatments". "A better understanding of the relationship between the urinary microbiome and bladder health may fundamentally transform our earlier belief that urine is "sterile". Against "a worldwide crisis… due to rapid expansion of MDR bacteria", "current concepts of antibiotic stewardship have provoked a further initiative to develop agents outside the traditional pipeline of antibiotics", with "renewed vigor in pursuing non-antibiotic approaches to UTI treatment and prevention".

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112NTTp8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^1117s5av]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are common in many clinical settings but especially in general practice, where they account for 25% of antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription of antibiotics when many cases are self limiting contributes to increased resistance rates, posing a serious health threat. Disease burden and treatment costs have to be considered as well. Escherichia coli, the main causative agent, is increasingly resistant to current antibiotics, and the number of new antibiotics being developed is declining. Many current primary care guidelines, however, still recommend antibiotics as a first line treatment, at least when standard measures do not lead to symptom relief. As urinary tract infection is often self limiting, and less antibiotic prescribing lowers levels of antibiotic resistance, efforts should be made to reduce rates of prescription.

Earlier trials assessed placebo compared with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection as well as delayed prescription of antibiotics. These trials reported a delayed resolution of symptoms and prolonged time to bacterial clearance but no serious complications. From qualitative studies and surveys, we know that many affected women are aware of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and might agree to avoid or postpone such treatment.

In a pilot study we compared symptomatic (ibuprofen) with antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin) in 79 women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Although this study was inadequately powered for a definitive result, it showed that ibuprofen was not inferior for symptom resolution, with 24/36 women recovering without antibiotic treatment. In the current study we assessed whether the number of antibiotic prescriptions issued for uncomplicated urinary tract infection can be reduced by symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen, reserving antibiotics for women who return with worsening or recurrent symptoms, and without an increase in symptom burden, recurrences, or complications.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^112UM7hm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1124xoE5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I2 = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: -46%, 95% CI: -56% to -37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^113GuFPD]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pivmecillinam is assumed to have inferior efficacy to other first-line alternatives such as nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. However, a recent study, that was comparable to ours, found cure rates of nitrofurantoin that were very similar to ours (70%), while cure rates were lower for fosfomycin. Further, the time to symptom resolution was similar in both studies, while long-term clinical success of pivmecillinam was higher than for nitrofurantoin course (84% vs. 70%). A randomised controlled study comparing pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin would determine the best option for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. In the meantime, pivmecillinam for 3 days or nitrofurantoin for 5 days appears to have comparable effect for treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

S. saprophyticus is frequently found in UTI and resistant to mecillinam in vitro. However, the bacteriological success (87%) and clinical (65%) success were both high in our study. Previously findings have also shown that pivmecillinam seems effective for UTI caused by bacteria not presumed susceptible to mecillinam.

There was no significant difference in reported adverse events between the groups. The reported adverse events were mild and mostly gastro-intestinal (24%). The reported rate of AR was higher than expected compared to other studies with pivmecillinam. A possible explanation may be that participants in our study recorded adverse events daily and also received a higher daily dose compared to most participants in the other studies.

A shorter duration than three days could be sufficient, however, this study and othersfound a time to symptom resolution to around three days. The findings supporting a 3-day course are in line with the recent antibiotic mantra that "shorter is better"and the utility of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial chemotherapies; both important in the context of fighting antimicrobial resistance.

### Cefaclor as a first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated cystitis: a retrospective single-center study [^115AMf3E]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most frequently reported infections, and acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) is the most common presentation of UTIs. Approximately 50% of women will experience at least one UTI during their lifetime, and 25% will have recurrent infections. Given that successive or newer generations of antibiotics tend to have increased activity against Gram-negative bacilli, and wide-spectrum antibiotics have been favored for a long time, AUC drives antibiotic use around the world, leading to the increasing antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens.

In Japan, fluoroquinolones have been widely introduced as the treatment for AUC, because levofloxacin (LVFX) was recommended as the first-line therapy for pre-menopausal women and as the second-line treatment for the menopausal women according to the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society of Chemotherapy guidelines 2015 (JAID/JSC). However, f luoroquinolone resistance among uropathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae is particularly problematic. Although the rates of the drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the community had remained low at < 1% for decades, the rate has skyrocketed in recent years, ranging from 10 to 30% in developed countries. Additionally, the American Urological Association is strengthening the current warnings that fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be avoided for the treatment of AUC due to significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^1122cGCL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line therapy, ACP 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate a short course of antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, TMP/SMX for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose in female patients with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis.

### Avoid using a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the first-line treatment of… [^116Q9Kvw]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

For women with uncomplicated UTIs, fluoroquinolone antibiotics should not be considered first-line treatment. Although fluoroquinolones are efficacious in three-day regimens, they have a higher risk of ecological adverse events, such as increasing multidrug resistant organisms. Thus, fluoroquinolones should only be used for the treatment of acute UTIs for women who should not be prescribed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^117LnxXk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Antimicrobial agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114PmJ6k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, resistance development and safety of different antimicrobial treatments for acute uncomplicated lower UTI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of antimicrobials for acute uncomplicated UTI in women were included. The outcomes of interest were symptomatic and bacteriological cure at short and long-term follow-up, resistance development, number of days to symptom resolution, days of work loss, adverse events and complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was as effective as fluoroquinolones in achieving short-term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and long-term (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) symptomatic cure. Beta-lactam drugs were as effective as TMP-SMX for short-term (RR 0.95' 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) and long-term (RR 1.06' 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) symptomatic cure. Short-term cure for nitrofurantoin was similar to that of TMP-SMX (RR 0.99' 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04) as was long-term symptomatic cure (RR 1.01' 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). Fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactams (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) for short-term bacteriological cure. Rashes were more frequent in patients treated with TMP-SMX than with nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolones and in patients treated with beta-lactam drugs compared to fluoroquinolones. Minimal data were available on the emergence of resistant strains during or after antimicrobial treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

No differences were observed between the classes of antimicrobials included in this review for the symptomatic cure of acute uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones proved more effective than beta-lactams for the short-term bacteriological outcome, probably with little clinical significance. Individualised treatment should take into consideration the predictable susceptibility of urinary pathogens in local areas, possible adverse events and resistance development, and patient preference.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic resistance risk after antibiotic exposure is supported by a meta-analysis: "In 5 studies of urinary tract bacteria (14,348 participants), the pooled odds ratio for resistance was 2.5 (95% CI: 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months". The authors note persistence and population impact, as "The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months", and "even transient use of antibiotics can affect the carriage of resistant organisms and impact the endemic level of resistance in the population".

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^113wUHSC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly diagnosed outpatient infection. In the US, more than 7 million people are referred to physicians for UTIs each year, and UTIs account for approximately 15% of all antibiotic prescriptions, with an annual cost to the US health care system of approximately $1.6 billion.

In 2011, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated their international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal women due to the increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance. For the optimal treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, the IDSA recommends nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin trometamol, and pivmecillinam as first-line therapy. Despite clear IDSA guidelines, practice patterns vary widely with numerous studies showing substantial discrepancies between clinical practice guidelines and antibiotic prescribing practices. A recent studyreported that the rate of IDSA antibiotic guideline concordance (hereinafter, guideline concordance) for UTIs ranged from 58.4% to 64.6%, and several studies, have shown that obstetricians and gynecologists are more likely to prescribe a first-line antibiotic compared with other clinicians in other specialties.

Antibiotic treatments for UTIs have been evaluated in a variety of different health care settings, but, to our knowledge, treatment patterns have not yet been studied in the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS provides health care to 9.6 million beneficiaries including active-duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents through the Department of Defense health insurance known as TRICARE. The MHS delivers care in 2 distinct settings: direct care through more than 350 military health facilities and via the US private sector care through civilian fee-for-service facilities. The ability to compare direct care and private sector care is a unique aspect of the MHS. Evaluating antibiotic prescribing patterns for uncomplicated UTIs in this universally insured population may help provide valuable insights on antibiotic treatment patterns in an optimal care environment. In addition, the Department of Defense formally chartered an antibiotic stewardship program in 2017, which has been implemented across the MHS; however, currently there is no specific requirement that hospitals have a specific outpatient or UTI protocol. Thus, the existence of any of these types of antibiotic stewardship programs varies across the MHS.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^1169q5bN]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of a personalised audit and feedback prescribing report (AF) and brief educational summary (ES) on empiric treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) by family physicians (FPs).

Design

Cluster randomised control trial.

Setting

The intervention was conducted in British Columbia, Canada between 23 September 2021 and 28 March 2022.

Participants

We randomised 5073 FPs into a standard AF and ES intervention arm (n = 1691), an ES-only arm (n = 1691) and a control arm (n = 1691).

Interventions

The AF contained personalised and peer-comparison data on first-line antibiotic prescriptions for women with uncomplicated lower UTI and key therapeutic recommendations. The ES contained detailed, evidence-based UTI management recommendations, incorporated regional antibiotic resistance data and recommended nitrofurantoin as a first-line treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Nitrofurantoin as first-line pharmacological treatment for uncomplicated lower UTI, analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.

Results

We identified 21307 cases of uncomplicated lower UTI among the three trial arms during the study period. The impact of receiving both the AF and ES increased the relative probability of prescribing nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment for uncomplicated lower UTI by 28% (OR 1.28; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.52), relative to the delay arm. This translates to additional prescribing of nitrofurantoin as first-line treatment, instead of alternates, in an additional 8.7 cases of uncomplicated UTI per 100 FPs during the 6-month study period.

Conclusion

AF prescribing data with educational materials can improve primary care prescribing of antibiotics for uncomplicated lower UTI.

Trial Registration Number

NCT05817253.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^114FurQs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Effects of a multimodal intervention in primary care to reduce second line antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections in women: parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial [^116TAcfN]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed in relation to all antibiotics prescribed for uncomplicated UTIs after one year, calculated as the absolute difference in the mean proportion of the prescriptions between the control and intervention group. According to national guidelines, second line drugs were all antibiotics other than trimethoprim, pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or nitroxoline, which are first line treatments.

The secondary outcome was the proportion of all antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of UTIs after 12 months, calculated as the absolute difference in the mean proportion of all antibiotics prescribed between the intervention and control group. The prescription proportion of all antibiotics was defined as the proportion of first line and second line antibiotics within all UTI cases. Other exploratory outcomes were the proportion of high and low prescribers, the changes of prescribing behaviour over time and factors associated with low performance (defined as > 10% of second line antibiotic prescriptions).

After publication of the study protocol, we added women with UTIs who were treated with any antibiotic after 12 months as an exploratory outcome to assess whether any changes could be observed with the intervention. For this outcome, we calculated the mean difference in the proportion of UTI cases treated with antibiotics in all UTI cases. Furthermore, we added cases with recurrent UTI and complications (eg, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, and hospital admissions) as exploratory outcomes.

Data analysis

Data analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle on the full analysis set, which is as close as possible to an ideal intention-to-treat population. All randomly assigned practices remained in the allocated arm for analysis. Practices for which prescription data at baseline and from Q4 were available, formed the full analysis set. Prescription data were available and analysed as aggregated data for each practice and each quarter from Qb to Q4. Depending on the data type, descriptive statistics were used to summarise central tendencies (eg, means; variability, such as standard deviations; and frequencies of participant characteristics, prescribing patterns, and complications). For the primary and secondary hypotheses, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for the baseline proportion of prescribing and for region as defined a priori. Assumptions were examined before conducting ANCOVA to ensure the appropriateness of the statistical method.

### Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112Vuejg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections encountered and treated in outpatients. A set of guidelines published in 1999 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy.

Methods

We undertook a study of cross-sectional data describing the use of ambulatory medical services in the United States by women ≥ 18 years of age who had uncomplicated UTI. Data from 1996 to 2001 were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to (1) examine the prescribing practices for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and (2) determine whether these practices were influenced by the recommendation in the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The major outcomes measurement was to evaluate whether antibacterial selection was influenced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data were analyzed by year, treatment in private offices vs. hospital clinics, race, geographic location, the specialty of the prescribing health care provider, and the payment method of the patient.

Results

We identified 2339 cases of uncomplicated UTI. Trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, the use of trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change significantly (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.30; p = 0.53), whereas the use of ciprofloxacin increased significantly (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.75; P ≤ .016). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, geographic region, race, physician specialty, payment method, and whether the visit was by a new or returning patient.

Conclusions

Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendation of trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI, physicians in the United States have not altered their prescribing practices. Adjustment for age, geographic region, race, physician specialty, and payment method confirmed a lack of adherence to this recommendation.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Effects of a multimodal intervention in primary care to reduce second line antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections in women: parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial [^113EFM6M]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

The intervention was found to be sustained over the one year period and was most effective in practices with high proportions of second line prescriptions. The results are in line with Schwartz and colleagues who were able to show a reduction in antibiotic prescription rates for respiratory tract infections in high prescribing GPs using a single letter. Targeting future interventions to high prescribers only might be the most effective approach because we could show the greatest benefit in this group. To achieve better results, peer discussion rounds on educational material and prescription rates could be promoted and incentivised in, for example, existing quality circles. Similar measures were successfully implemented by the Swedish strategic programme for the rational use of antimicrobial agents and surveillance of resistance (STRAMA). When aiming to reduce antibiotic prescription in general practice, no gold standard exists. In several well designed randomised controlled trials with a complex intervention, different changes of antibiotics prescriptions behaviour were observed. Aghlmandi and colleagues aimed to improve prescription rates in respiratory and urinary tract infections by audit and feedback with peer benchmarking, similar to our study but without a positive effect. Using a multifaceted complex intervention with interactive, multimedia, and electronic components Vellinga and colleagues could increase the rate of first line prescribing in UTI by 25% accompanied by an unintended increase in overall antimicrobial prescribing for UTI. The study by Hartman and colleagues reduced the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections in frail older adults (mean age of 86 years) by an absolute 50% but a comparison is difficult because the intervention was focused on an algorithm guided diagnosis in older people, which is a different topic in a different population. Which component of the multifaceted intervention has the highest impact is unclear. Providing data for regional resistance rates is a new approach. These data are required by national and international guidelines and necessary because in routine practice, resistance rates from uncomplicated UTI are unknown because available data are biased by complicated cases. Additionally, data showed regional differences in resistance to first line and second line antibiotics, allowing adjustment of treatment choices. Furthermore, data inform guidelines for treatment recommendations. Kurotschka and colleagues showed that resistance of Escherichia coli gradually decreased over time after fluoroquinolone use declined. Similar results were shown in previous studies. Thus, a positive effect on resistance rates of E coli can be expected.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### CQUIN audit for prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in an acute medical assessment unit [^117MMKr4]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis in medical admissions unit. NHS Choices states that around half of all UK women will have a UTI at least once in their lives and one in 2000 healthy men will have one at least once a year. There is a higher mortality and morbidity associated with UTIs in critically ill patients, and it is important that UTIs are treated promptly and adequately.

Moreover, numerous studies have shown an increasing resistance to several common antibiotics; of note in 2001 the first international survey of prevalence and susceptibility of organisms causing uncomplicated UTIs in the community (ECO-SENS Project), found that 42% E. coli isolated (accounting for 77% of pathogens cultured) was resistant to one or more of the more common antibiotics. The microbiology departments of hospital Trusts develop guidelines on first and second line antibiotics to treat infections based on local organisms and sensitivities.

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111fdQLH]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Acute cystitis first-line selection and safety — when antimicrobial therapies for UTI are compared by clinical and/or bacteriological cure there is relatively little to distinguish agents, so the IDSA Guideline emphasizes in vitro resistance prevalence and ecological adverse effects as key considerations; fluoroquinolones are not among the suggested first-line agents in the United States, the three first-line agents available are nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin shows exceptional durability against emergence of resistance, TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric use where local resistance rates exceed 20%, and with the exception of fosfomycin, single dose antibiotics should not be used in patients with UTI; fluoroquinolone agents have potential adverse side effects including QTc prolongation, tendon rupture, and increased risk of aortic rupture leading to FDA black box warnings.

BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Results

Physician demographics

We identified 6813 active FPs in BC in 2021. We excluded from randomisation 639 who wrote fewer than 100 prescriptions during 2020, 771 who had 0 prescriptions for any oral antibiotic medications and 330 who did not meet our mailing criteria (deceased, retired or blank or out-of-province mailing address). 5073 physicians were randomised to 1 of 3 trial arms (figure 2). A comparison of physician characteristics with absolute standardised differences between the trial arms is shown in table 1. Physician age, sex, time since medical school graduation, prescribing volumes and frequency of UTI diagnosis were all well-balanced.

Combined impact of AF and ES

In the ITT analysis, the standard intervention arm had 7246 cases of uncomplicated UTI and the control arm had 7191 cases of uncomplicated UTI. The AF and ES led to a 4.8% increase in preference for nitrofurantoin with a corresponding decrease in preference for any of the other antibiotics. In terms of the preference odds, the GEE showed the odds of prescribing nitrofurantoin rather than another antibiotic increased by 28% (95% CI: 7% to 52%). The increase in nitrofurantoin preference was accompanied by decreases in preferences for the other antibiotics although the cluster-adjusted CIs included the null value. The primary result was consistent in the PP analysis and similar magnitudes of decreased preferences in the secondary outcomes (online supplemental file 6).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^111s2fcA]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

Box 1
Audit and feedback script (example)

Table 2
List of activities at intervention and control sites

The audit and feedback component of the intervention (based on feedback intervention theory)was a highly personalised, interactive, one-on-one intervention with primary care providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated cystitis and other UTI syndromes and to encourage them to prescribe a guideline-concordant antibiotic regimen. We also included information about first-line antibiotics recommended by the IDSA guidelines and AAFP and determined whether the antibiotic regimen prescribed by the providers was in accordance with the guidelines (box 1).

In the intervention period, we distributed guidelines at both sites (intervention and control). Distributing the guidelines addressed awareness, but we did not expect guideline dissemination alone to be an effective method to achieve behaviour change. At the intervention site, we also conducted a training session to help providers engage with and internalise guidelines content. Our educational session provided a detailed overview of the IDSA treatment guidelines; definitions for various UTI syndromes, including uncomplicated versus complicated UTI, and actual clinical examples. During our training session, we also taught the providers how to use the decision aid (figure 2). The investigators selected actual cases of UTI seen in the clinics to design both teaching cases to address the specific clinical scenarios that were problematic for the interview participants.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^111xwYMR]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to account for patient-specific factors, such as risk of allergic reactions, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions, when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, to avoid preventable adverse events.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^114R1CdB]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

The European Association of Urology Urological Infections Guidelines Panel is proposing a new classification scheme for categorizing urinary tract infections (UTIs) into uncomplicated and complicated types. This classification would provide clarity and facilitate effective clinical management of UTIs, and acknowledges the importance of addressing clinical and sex-specific nuances in the care of individual patients.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^112m772W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review, we evaluated five randomized controlled trials (of 1309 patients) comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Although study protocols and reported outcomes were heterogeneous, two smaller studies that were at high and unclear risk of bias found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics, while three studies with low risk of bias supported antibiotic therapy over NSAIDs in terms of symptom resolution. Furthermore, two studies at low risk of bias found higher risks of pyelonephritis in patients who received NSAIDs versus antibiotics; the third study with low risk of bias also found a higher risk of pyelonephritis in patients receiving NSAIDs, but the confidence interval for the risk difference included zero. In sum, these findings support the use of antibiotics as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTI for both symptom resolution and prevention of pyelonephritis.

Despite the superiority of antibiotic therapy, 39–58% of participants in the NSAID groups achieved symptom resolution by day 3 or 4. For comparison, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials demonstrated clinical success (symptom improvement or resolution by first follow-up visit) in 25–54% of participants in the placebo arms. One possible explanation for why many UTI symptoms resolved without antibiotic therapy is that not all women included in the studies may have had true UTIs. Inclusion in most studies was based on symptoms alone — a commonly accepted approach for uncomplicated UTIsthat is consistent with several clinical practice guidelines from countries where the trials were conducted. – However, clinical symptoms only correctly diagnose UTIs half of the time. Thus, it is possible that a large number of participants may not have had a UTI or been at risk of worsening infection. Indeed, in the four studies that collected urine specimens for culture at the time of inclusion, only 64–86% of patients in either study arm had positive cultures. Women often suffer from urinary symptoms for a host of reasons (e.g. incontinence, medication side effects) that are misdiagnosed as a UTI. Barriers to obtaining timely urine testing often promote alternatives to testing, such as "as needed" antibiotic prescriptions or prescriptions by phone.

### The revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the era of antibiotic stewardship [^113mosax]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, this review highlights the advantages of revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs).

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that these four oral old antibiotics, fosfomycin trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline and pivmecillinam, show no increasing antibiotic resistance against uropathogens causing uUTI, are still effective for the treatment of uUTI and exhibit only minimal or no collateral damage as compared with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporines.

Summary

According to the principles of antibiotic stewardship, the prudent use of antibiotics is needed. Therefore, recent international and national guidelines already favour these old oral antibiotics as first-choice treatment of uUTI. Unfortunately, implementation of these guidelines is still suboptimal.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.
