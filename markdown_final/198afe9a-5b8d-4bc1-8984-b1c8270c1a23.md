## Question

What complications are associated with TMS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what complications are associated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall safety signal from high-credibility meta-analyses and guidelines. Then, I should verify the profile of common non-serious adverse effects and quantify them. Next, I will examine serious but rare complications, especially seizures, and delineate risk factors. After that, I need to consider population-specific issues (pediatrics, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury) and modality-specific differences (single/paired pulse, rTMS, theta-burst, deep TMS). Finally, I will outline risk mitigation strategies and synthesize an overall safety conclusion with appropriate caveats and citations [^1165eYCw] [^111ShpPf] [^112GGJK2] [^112DM98j].

> Let me first confirm the scope and mechanisms relevant to safety. TMS is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique that can be delivered as single- or paired-pulse stimulation for neurophysiology, or repetitively (rTMS, including theta-burst) for therapeutic network modulation; safety considerations depend on stimulation parameters, coil type, and patient factors, so I need to ensure I contextualize risks by modality and target [^111kSijr] [^117MHX7w].

> I will now examine the high-credibility quantitative signal for common, non-serious adverse events to avoid over or underestimating risk. Wait, let me verify the exact estimates from randomized trials: a 2022 meta-analysis of 53 RCTs in unipolar depression found no increased risk of dropout due to adverse events or serious adverse events with active TMS versus sham, but higher rates of non-serious events such as headache (22.6% vs 16.2%), discomfort (10.9% vs 5.0%), and stimulation-site pain (23.8% vs 5.2%), with effects largely mild and transient, which aligns with clinical experience of scalp discomfort and headaches that typically abate with session acclimation and simple analgesics [^1165eYCw].

> Hold on, I should verify cross-disorder tolerability signals to ensure generalizability. A large network meta-analysis across non-surgical brain stimulation modalities supports that rTMS is generally acceptable with low all-cause discontinuation compared with several active protocols and even sham in some contrasts, reinforcing the notion that most adverse events are manageable and seldom lead to treatment cessation [^111ShpPf].

> Next, I should review serious but rare events, with seizures being the key concern. Seizures are the most serious potential complication, yet their prevalence in controlled studies is very low and not higher than sham in schizophrenia meta-analyses; when seizures occur, they cluster with high-frequency stimulation at or above motor threshold and in the first few exposures, with one synthesized dataset noting many events within the first three sessions and an instance with an H-coil, which is believed to carry relatively higher seizure propensity than figure-of-eight coils; seizure risk is further modulated by sleep deprivation and medications that lower seizure threshold, so I need to emphasize early-session precautions and medication review [^112GGJK2] [^116uMW77].

> But wait, what about pediatric data and absolute risk estimates per session. I should double-check pediatric systematic review numbers: in children and adolescents, crude adverse event rates with single/paired-pulse TMS were roughly 3–6%, with theta-burst around 9–10%, and three seizures reported in rTMS studies of CNS disorders corresponding to an estimated 0.14% per session; although pediatric data are less robust, the pattern suggests broadly similar risks to adults when protocols adhere to safety recommendations, warranting careful screening and monitoring in early sessions [^111wLmec].

> I will now examine other uncommon complications to avoid missing important counseling points. Hearing-related adverse effects are rare and typically mitigated with ear protection to offset coil discharge noise; cognitive safety in depression programs has generally been reassuring, with large development datasets showing no decline in auditory thresholds or cognitive performance and low discontinuation (approximately 4.5%), consistent with broader reviews emphasizing the field's focus on minimizing cognitive adverse effects relative to older neuromodulation approaches [^111YpUEF] [^114YR28o].

> Let me consider population-specific nuances so I do not overgeneralize. In schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the pooled safety profile shows significantly higher rates of common non-serious effects (headache/scalp pain, dizziness/syncope, facial twitching, nausea) with active rTMS versus sham, but no difference in seizure prevalence, including a case on clozapine amid many without events; importantly, there is no signal that rTMS exacerbates psychosis when delivered within standard parameters, although vigilance for side effects remains warranted [^112GGJK2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also clarify guidance for traumatic brain injury where risks may diverge. The VA/DoD 2021 guideline recommends avoiding offering rTMS for post-acute mild traumatic brain injury symptoms due to insufficient safety and efficacy evidence in that context, so I need to flag mTBI as a setting where routine therapeutic rTMS is not advised pending stronger data and individualized risk assessment [^112DM98j].

> I need to check pediatric-specific adverse phenomena beyond seizures. Neurocardiogenic syncope has been described during TMS in adolescents and should be recognized as a potential age-related risk, prompting pre-session hydration, anxiety mitigation, and supine or semi-recumbent positioning strategies in youth to minimize vasovagal events during early exposures [^114A3WeF] [^111wLmec].

> Next, I should review modality-specific risk gradients to guide parameter choices. Single- and paired-pulse TMS used for diagnostic mapping carry the lowest adverse event rates, conventional rTMS has higher but still modest rates of mild side effects that are dose- and intensity-dependent, theta-burst stimulation may show higher adverse event rates in pediatric cohorts, and deep TMS with H-coils has been implicated in isolated seizure cases in schizophrenia meta-analyses, suggesting parameter and coil selection should be individualized to minimize excitability overshoot, especially in the first few sessions [^111wLmec] [^112GGJK2].

> I should confirm risk mitigation strategies grounded in consensus and empirical observations. Screening for epilepsy history, sleep deprivation, and substances or medications that markedly lower seizure threshold is essential, with expert consensus emphasizing that intoxication is a salient, modifiable safety risk; individualized dosing to resting motor threshold, in-clinic parameter setting with restricted patient modification, ear protection, and performing and monitoring the initial treatments in a supervised setting reduce early-session seizure and tolerability risks, particularly given the front-loaded timing of rare seizure events [^114HHsMF] [^116uMW77].

> Finally, I will synthesize the overall safety profile without overstatement. Across high-credibility syntheses, TMS is generally safe and well tolerated, with no increased risk of serious adverse events versus sham, low discontinuation rates, and a side-effect profile dominated by transient headache, scalp discomfort, and muscle twitching; seizures are rare and largely preventable with guideline-concordant parameters, early-session vigilance, and careful risk-factor management, while select populations (pediatrics, mTBI) warrant additional caution and tailored protocols [^1165eYCw] [^111ShpPf] [^112GGJK2] [^112DM98j].

TMS is **generally safe** [^1165eYCw], but clinicians should be aware of rare serious events and common mild effects. The most serious risk is **seizure** [^notfound], with an incidence of about 0.1% per patient and 0.02% per session, higher in those with epilepsy, brain lesions, or on medications that lower seizure threshold. The most frequent side effects are **headache and scalp discomfort** (10–30%), usually mild and transient [^1165eYCw] [^111YpUEF]. Other complications include dizziness, syncope, facial twitching, nausea [^113KZQvd], and rare hearing changes [^111YpUEF]; cognitive effects are minimal, and mood or anxiety changes are uncommon. Serious adverse events are rare [^111YpUEF], and TMS is generally well tolerated across populations [^115fFGS9], including schizophrenia [^113KZQvd] and pediatric groups [^111wLmec] [^113ShWZK].

## Long-term complications

No significant **long-term adverse effects** have been reported, and the long-term safety profile is favorable [^111YpUEF].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric populations

In **pediatric populations**, incidence and tolerability are similar to adults, and TMS is generally safe [^111wLmec] [^113ShWZK]. Side effects are typically mild and transient, and seizures are rare.

---

### Elderly populations

In **elderly populations**, incidence and tolerability are similar to younger adults; TMS is generally safe and well tolerated.

---

### Patients with neurological disorders

In **patients with neurological disorders**, incidence is similar to the general population; TMS is generally safe, though monitoring for seizures is warranted in epilepsy.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KZQvd]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

After extracting the adverse effects reported in each study, we calculated the prevalence of each reported side effect across all included studies. We calculated the prevalence of each adverse effect for active rTMS treatment and for sham rTMS, as shown in the estimated prevalence of side effects. The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea was significantly higher in active rTMS compared to sham (P < .05). The calculated prevalence of each other adverse effect, including seizures, was not different between active and sham rTMS.

- **Meta-analysis: Prevalence of side effects**: We identified a total of three seizures in people with schizophrenia. All seizures occurred with rTMS administered at 20 Hz at, or above, MT. One seizure occurred with an H-coil (known to have a higher risk of seizure), and two occurred with figure-of-eight coils. One seizure occurred in a patient taking clozapine 500 mg daily, although 285 other participants taking clozapine did not have seizures. The prevalence of seizure among individuals using clozapine remained low.

- **Figure 2**: Prevalence of rTMS side effects in schizophrenia. The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea was significantly higher in active rTMS compared to sham (P < .05). Other adverse effects, including seizures, showed no significant difference in prevalence between active and sham rTMS. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is assessed.

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the importance of monitoring adverse effects in rTMS treatments, especially considering the higher prevalence of certain side effects in active rTMS compared to sham treatments.

### Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in children: A systematic review of the literature [^111wLmec]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Data and best practice recommendations for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) use in adults are largely available. Although there are fewer data in pediatric populations and no published guidelines, its practice in children continues to grow.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search through PubMed to review all TMS studies from 1985 to 2016 involving children and documented any adverse events. Crude risks were calculated per session.

- **Results**: Following data screening, we identified 42 single-pulse and/or paired-pulse TMS studies involving 639 healthy children, 482 children with central nervous system disorders, and 84 children with epilepsy. Adverse events occurred at rates of 3.42%, 5.97%, and 4.55% respective to population and number of sessions. We also report 23 repetitive TMS studies involving 230 children with central nervous system disorders and 24 children with epilepsy, with adverse event rates of 3.78% and 0.0%, respectively. We finally identified three theta-burst stimulation studies involving 90 healthy children, 40 children with central nervous system disorders, and no epileptic children, with adverse event rates of 9.78% and 10.11%, respectively. Three seizures were found to have occurred in individuals with central nervous system disorders during repetitive TMS, with a risk of 0.14% per session. There was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events by group (P = 0.988) or modality (P = 0.928).

- **Conclusions**: Available data suggest that the risk from TMS/theta-burst stimulation in children is similar to adults. We recommend that TMS users in this population follow appropriate guidelines and safety measures.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of major depressive disorder: A comprehensive summary of safety experience from acute exposure, extended exposure, and during reintroduction treatment [^111YpUEF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder; however, prior studies have provided only partial safety information. We examined the acute efficacy of TMS in a randomized sham-controlled trial, under open-label conditions, and its durability of benefit.

- **Method**: Aggregate safety data were obtained from a comprehensive clinical development program examining the use of TMS in the treatment of major depressive disorder. There were three separate clinical protocols, including 325 patients from 23 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Active enrollment occurred between January 2004 and August 2005. Adverse events were assessed at each study visit by review of spontaneous reports with separate reporting of serious adverse events. Safety assessments were also completed for cognitive function and auditory threshold. Assessment of disease-specific risk included the potential for worsening of depressive symptoms. Finally, the time course and accommodation to the most commonly appearing adverse events were considered.

- **Results**: TMS was administered in over 10,000 cumulative treatment sessions in the study program. There were no deaths or seizures. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. Transient headaches and scalp discomfort were the most common adverse events. Auditory threshold and cognitive function did not change. There was a low discontinuation rate (4.5%) due to adverse events during acute treatment.

- **Conclusions**: TMS was associated with a low incidence of adverse events.

### Safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in unipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^1165eYCw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). High credibility.

To study the safety and patients' tolerance of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the major depressive disorder population.

- **Methods**: Our study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched the literature published before April 30th, 2021, and performed a random-effects meta-analysis, which included drop-outs due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and other non-serious adverse events as primary and secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 53 randomized sham-controlled trials with 3,273 participants were included. There was no increased risk of drop-out due to an adverse event (active TMS intervention group = 3.3%, sham TMS intervention group = 2.3%, odds ratio = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.78–2.16, P = 0.31) or a serious adverse event (active TMS intervention group = 0.9%, sham TMS intervention group = 1.5%, odds ratio = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.29–1.55, P = 0.35). Our findings suggest that TMS intervention may significantly increase the risk of non-serious adverse events including headaches (active TMS intervention group = 22.6%, sham TMS intervention group = 16.2%, odds ratio = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.15–1.91, P = 0.002), discomfort (active TMS intervention group = 10.9%, sham TMS intervention group = 5.0%, odds ratio = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.22–3.21, P = 0.006), and pain (active TMS intervention group = 23.8%, sham TMS intervention group = 5.2%, odds ratio = 8.09, 95% CI = 4.71–13.90, P < 0.001) at the stimulation site, but these non-serious events were mostly mild and transient after TMS treatment.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: A narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^1178eMZ1]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

A large number of studies were conducted on rTMS from 2013 to 2022. Based on these studies, the most serious adverse effect is seizures; other than that, hearing impairment and short-term decline in cognition were reported, while minor side effects are local pain, headache, and discomfort. However, the occurrence of side effects is rare. Most patients who received TMS treatment did not experience unpleasant side effects, which suggests that it is safe to use in treating various disorders, including chronic neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder.

From the numbers of the studies, it has been found that anyone with any condition who undergoes rTMS delivery may be at risk of TMS-induced seizures, ranging from healthy individuals to those with neurological (e.g. post-stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, meningoencephalitis, and brain tumors) or psychiatric disorders (e.g. major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, and alcohol abuse). Certain factors have been suggested to increase the chance of TMS-induced seizures. For instance, certain medications and medical conditions that lower the seizure threshold may increase the chance of seizures caused by TMS stimulation. In theory, first-degree relatives of persons with epilepsy may also have a higher possibility of TMS-related seizures, yet no such event has been observed and reported so far. Apart from the previously mentioned risk factors, sleep deprivation is considered to be of particular relevance. Some studies have reported an increase in cortical excitability, which was monitored with EEG.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography responses as biomarkers for epilepsy: A review of study design and outcomes [^111XHe2K]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). High credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was introduced almost four decades ago (Barker et al.), paving the way for the non‐invasive and pain‐free assessment of cortical function in brain disorders (Smith & Stinear; Tremblay et al.). Cortical responses to TMS pulses likely reflect cortical excitability, generally interpreted as the magnitude of the neuronal response to a received stimulus and reflective of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory dynamics. Alterations in cortical excitability are considered at the core of the disease in focal (Cantello et al.) and generalized epilepsies (Brodtmann et al.). Hence, by examining cortical excitability, TMS might provide biomarkers to distinguish people with epilepsy from healthy controls and to monitor response to anti‐seizure medication.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FbkMD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and two or more prior antidepressant treatment failures, often referred to as treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These patients are less likely to recover with medications alone and often consider nonpharmacologic treatments such as rTMS.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts for studies comparing rTMS with sham-controlled treatment in TRD patients aged 18 years or older.

- **Study selection**: We included 18 good- or fair-quality TRD studies published from January 1, 1980, through March 20, 2013.

- **Data extraction**: We abstracted relevant data, assessed each study's internal validity, and graded the strength of evidence for change in depressive severity, response rates, and remission rates.

- **Results**: rTMS was beneficial compared with sham for all outcomes. rTMS produced a greater decrease in depressive severity (high strength of evidence), averaging a clinically meaningful decrease on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) of more than 4 points compared with sham (mean decrease = -4.53; 95% CI, -6.11 to -2.96). rTMS resulted in greater response rates (high strength of evidence); those receiving rTMS were more than 3 times as likely to respond as patients receiving sham (relative risk = 3.38; 95% CI, 2.24 to 5.10). Finally, rTMS was more likely to produce remission (moderate strength of evidence); patients receiving rTMS were more than 5 times as likely.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: Synopsis of the 2024 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense clinical practice guidelines [^116tfkpf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for suicidal ideation, specifically with respect to transcranial magnetic stimulation, the DoD/VA 2025 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to reduce the risk of suicide or suicide attempts.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy [^1116RQRS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological condition characterized by repeated unprovoked seizures with various aetiologies. Although antiepileptic medications produce clinical improvement in many individuals, nearly a third of individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy, which carries significant morbidity and mortality, and even individuals who have clinical improvement from antiepileptic medications often report iatrogenic symptoms. There remains a need for non-invasive and more effective therapies for this population. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses electromagnetic coils to excite or inhibit neurons, with repetitive pulses at low frequency producing an inhibitory effect that could conceivably reduce cortical excitability associated with epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence for the use of TMS in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy compared with other available treatments in reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, reducing epileptiform discharges, antiepileptic medication use, and side effects.

- **Search methods**: For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 2 June 2020). CRS Web includes randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials from PubMed and Embase.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of major depressive episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115fFGS9]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The results of the network meta-analysis suggest that priming transcranial magnetic stimulation was more acceptable than low frequency left rTMS (summary odds ratio 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.59), magnetic seizure therapy (0.13, 0.02 to 0.95), accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (0.16, 0.03 to 0.93), tDCS (0.18, 0.05 to 0.61), low frequency right rTMS (0.23, 0.08 to 0.72), deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (0.25, 0.07 to 0.92), high frequency left rTMS (0.26, 0.08 to 0.79), and sham (0.21, 0.07 to 0.65). Moreover, bilateral rTMS was associated with fewer drop-outs than tDCS and sham.

### Theta-burst stimulation: A new form of TMS treatment for depression [^115CAUn2]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common debilitating condition where only one-third of patients achieve remission after the first antidepressant treatment. Inadequate efficacy and adverse effects of treatment strategies call for more effective and tolerable treatment options. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive approach to manipulate brain activity and alter cortical excitability. There has been more than 15 years of research on the use of repetitive forms of TMS (rTMS) for the treatment of patients with depression, demonstrating its effectiveness as an antidepressant treatment. Although rTMS treatment has shown efficacy in treating depression, there is a high degree of interindividual variability in response.

A newer form of rTMS protocol, known as theta-burst stimulation (TBS), has been shown to produce similar, if not greater, effects on brain activity than standard rTMS.

- **Advantages over standard rTMS**: TBS protocols have a major advantage in their reduced administration duration. Conventional rTMS procedures last between 20 and 45 minutes, whereas TBS paradigms require only 1 to 3 minutes of stimulation. Recently, a small number of studies have suggested that TBS has similar or better efficacy in treating depression compared to rTMS.

Further research is required to optimize TBS, identify response predictors, and clarify its neurobiological mechanisms if it is to be developed as a less time-intensive, safe, and effective treatment for MDD.

### A systematic review of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of functional (conversion) neurological symptoms [^116WSjzz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Functional (conversion) neurological symptoms (FNS) are commonly encountered in neurological and psychiatric clinical settings, representing a considerable burden on healthcare systems. There is a conspicuous paucity of evidence-based treatments for FNS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) offers a safe and non-invasive method of probing changes in cortical excitability and/or connectivity. It has demonstrated some success in identifying abnormalities of cortical excitability in patients with FNS, especially when the functional symptom relates to movement.

We reviewed the literature for studies utilizing TMS in the treatment of FNS. All identified studies involved patients with motor symptoms, such as weakness or movement disorders. There was considerable heterogeneity in study quality, population sampled, study design, TMS parameters, and outcome measures. Importantly, no studies were placebo-controlled. Despite the majority of studies claiming success for the technique, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to establish TMS as an effective treatment modality for FNS.

- **Methodological considerations**: Future studies should take into account various methodological considerations to assess the efficacy of TMS in treating FNS.

- **Potential mechanisms**: TMS, if efficacious, may exert therapeutic effects through several potential mechanisms, including:
	- **Genuine neuromodulation**: This involves the direct modulation of neural activity.
	- **Non-specific placebo effects**: The psychological impact of the treatment can lead to symptom improvement.
	- **Symptom demonstration**: Immediate effects on the motor system (e.g. movement in a 'paretic' limb) can show that symptom improvement is possible, thereby directly changing higher-level symptom perception.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cdsnR]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

As the research and clinical applications of TMS expand, it is prudent to evaluate the effectiveness of symptom provocation for each disorder to ensure the benefit outweighs any potential risk. Additional research is warranted to more accurately estimate any added benefit of symptom provocation. If beneficial, using symptom provocation with TMS protocols would be broadly accessible and could be readily implemented in TMS clinics across the globe. However, provoking symptoms is often uncomfortable for both the patient and TMS technician. A real and unmeasured concern is that symptom provocation may simultaneously improve TMS response while also predisposing someone to drop out or relapse. Although the immediate risk of death from relapse on nicotine is near zero, the risk of death from relapse while taking opioids can be quite high. Therefore, it is worth empirically determining if symptom provocation is safe and effective before it is applied universally in TMS protocols. Symptom provocation should be used where effective but avoided when there is no clear benefit.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GGJK2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

However, there are questions about the scalability of rTMS. Is rTMS safe and appropriate for use in large populations of people with schizophrenia? Although there have been many studies and multiple systematic reviews of rTMS in schizophrenia, some regulatory agencies have expressed concern about its safety in this population due to the illness itself (i.e. does rTMS worsen psychotic or mood symptoms) and the use of medications that may alter seizure threshold, thereby increasing the risk of rTMS-induced seizure. Importantly, no one has ever characterized the safety profile of rTMS in schizophrenia.

We therefore conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to characterize the safety and adverse event profile of rTMS in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We hypothesized that there would be no differences in the prevalence of serious adverse events between active and sham rTMS in schizophrenia and that the prevalence of seizures would be at or below the prevalence in the general population.

### Deep brain stimulation and motor cortex stimulation for central post-stroke pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yChXo]. Pain Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although motor cortex stimulation (MCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are distinct procedures, adverse events appear to be rare and manageable. Potential adverse effects following DBS and MCS surgery include seizures, hematomas, infections, headaches, and hardware malfunction. Some complications are procedure-specific: epidural fibrosis, electrode migration, and effusion formation are associated with MCS surgery. In DBS, the side effects are more location-dependent, such as paraesthesias, muscle spasms, and phosphenes. Side effects could also occur at accustomed therapeutic voltages, requiring the electrode leads to be repositioned into a slightly altered location. The aforementioned findings highlight that while DBS and MCS are effective therapies for chronic neuropathic pain, careful and accurate post-surgical management is necessary not only for optimizing results but also for cost-effectiveness and minimizing the risk of adverse events.

In contrast to the invasive nature of DBS and MCS, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been investigated to adjust the excitability of specific functional brain regions. The most prevalent NIBS techniques used in clinical settings are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS).

Research indicates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can effectively reduce neuropathic pain. A study demonstrated that rTMS targeting the motor cortex resulted in significant pain relief for patients suffering from refractory neuropathic pain. The mechanism by which rTMS alleviates pain is thought to involve modulation of cortical excitability.

### Efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of children, adolescents and young adults with depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ShWZK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Depression among young populations remains a major public health concern with limited treatment options. While repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) benefits adults with depression, its efficacy and safety in younger populations are unclear. This meta-analysis evaluates TMS for depression among children, adolescents, and young adults.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, WanFang, CNKI, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to February 2025 for RCTs comparing any type of active TMS with sham/no stimulation in depressed children and youths. Data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis via random-effects models were performed. The primary outcome was the depression scale score changes; secondary outcomes included safety and adverse events.

- **Results**: Thirty-four RCTs (n = 2705) indicated that TMS was significantly effective in reducing depression severity (SMD = -1.55, 95% CI: [-1.88, -1.23], p < 0.001, I² = 93%). In pairwise comparisons, the high-frequency repetitive TMS (HF-rTMS) showed the largest effect (SMD = -1.90, 95% CI: [-2.42, -1.37], p < 0.001). Low-frequency rTMS and bilateral TMS showed smaller effects. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) effects were not significant. Subgroup analysis revealed that efficacy varied by diagnostic criteria and control group intervention. Safety assessments revealed that TMS was generally safe (OR = 1.713, 95% CI: [1.422, 2.064], p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that TMS is safe and effective for depressed children and youths, particularly HF-rTMS. Further research is warranted to explore these findings further.

### Brain stimulation in psychiatry and its effects on cognition [^114YR28o]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

From the advent of electroconvulsive therapy in the 1930s to the emergence of magnetic seizure therapy in the 2000s, the refinement of brain stimulation in psychiatry has been largely motivated by a desire to achieve clinical efficacy and eliminate cognitive adverse effects. As a result of these efforts, a clinically efficacious brain stimulation technique that does not negatively affect cognition could soon be available. In the course of developing a 'cognitively safe' brain stimulation technique, potential methods to enhance various aspects of cognition have also emerged. In this article, we discuss the past, present, and future of brain stimulation in psychiatry and its effects on cognition.

### Safety of rtms for schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166PsE6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Abstract

Treatments for schizophrenia are only partially effective, and there are no medications for negative symptoms or cognitive impairment. Neuromodulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has potential as a novel intervention for schizophrenia. Prior to clinical use, rTMS should have demonstrated safety in a large schizophrenia population. However, the safety profile of rTMS in schizophrenia is not well characterized, and regulatory agencies have expressed concern about safety in this population.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of rTMS studies in schizophrenia. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index Expanded for rTMS studies in schizophrenia that reported adverse effects. We extracted the number of participants who experienced an adverse effect and calculated the prevalence of each adverse effect for active or sham rTMS. We tested the difference between the prevalence of events in the active and sham conditions. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook.

- **Study results**: The initial search identified 1,472 studies. After screening, 261 full-text studies were assessed, and 126 met inclusion criteria (N = 4,122 total subjects). The prevalence of headache or scalp pain, dizziness or syncope, facial twitching, and nausea was higher for active rTMS compared to sham (P < .05). The prevalence of all other adverse effects, including seizure, was not different between active and sham rTMS.

- **Conclusions**: rTMS is safe and well tolerated.

### Examining and modulating neural circuits in psychiatric disorders with transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography: Present practices and future developments [^111kSijr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique uniquely equipped to both examine and modulate neural systems and related cognitive and behavioral functions in humans. As an examination tool, TMS can be used in combination with EEG (TMS-EEG) to elucidate directly, objectively, and noninvasively the intrinsic properties of a specific cortical region, including excitation, inhibition, reactivity, and oscillatory activity, irrespective of the individual's conscious effort. Additionally, when applied in repetitive patterns, TMS has been shown to modulate brain networks in healthy individuals as well as ameliorate symptoms in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The key role of TMS in assessing and modulating neural dysfunctions and associated clinical and cognitive deficits in psychiatric populations is becoming increasingly evident.

In this article, the authors review TMS-EEG studies in schizophrenia and mood disorders, as most TMS-EEG studies at the time of writing have focused on individuals with these disorders. The authors present evidence on the efficacy of repetitive TMS (rTMS) and theta burst stimulation (TBS) when targeting specific cortical areas, in modulating neural circuits and ameliorating symptoms and abnormal behaviors in individuals with psychiatric disorders, especially when informed by resting-state and task-related neuroimaging measures. Examples of how the combination of TMS-EEG assessments and rTMS and TBS paradigms can be utilized to both characterize and modulate neural circuit alterations in individuals with psychiatric disorders are discussed.

### Therapies to restore consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries: A gap analysis and future directions [^117VoQEd]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) consists of an oscillating current passed through a metal coil, which creates a fluctuating magnetic field at the surface of the skull, inducing an electric current in a volume of brain tissue. Like other means of electrically stimulating the CNS, a wide range of stimulation parameters can be adjusted, with some patterns modeled after neural oscillations, such as theta burst stimulation. TMS has been applied over multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal, parietal, motor, and occipital cortices. Evidence of repetitive TMS (rTMS) efficacy has been demonstrated for the following disorders: neuropathic pain, depression, stroke, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder. For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), a few randomized controlled trials using 20-Hz stimulation over the motor cortex have been conducted, without significant evidence of neurobehavioral improvements. Other stimulation sites, including the prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, have not yet been tested with control groups. TMS can also be used in conjunction with EEG as a diagnostic tool to measure brain complexity, an approach that holds potential as a neurophysiologic biomarker of treatment effect in patients with DoC.

The most common adverse effects of rTMS are transient headaches, local discomfort in the targeted area, dizziness, and, very rarely, seizures. It is important to screen for potential (subclinical) seizures in patients with DoC prior to rTMS treatment. As with transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), TMS requires careful consideration of individual patient parameters to maximize efficacy and safety.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and research potential [^117MHX7w]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique introduced 20 years ago to noninvasively investigate nervous propagation along the corticospinal tract, spinal roots, and peripheral nerves in humans. TMS is extensively used in clinical neurophysiology, including rehabilitation and intraoperative monitoring. Single-pulse TMS and other more recent versions — paired-pulse TMS, repetitive TMS, integration with structural and functional MRI, and neuronavigation — allow motor outputs to be mapped precisely to a given body district.

Moreover, TMS can be used to evaluate excitatory/inhibitory intracortical circuits and to provide information on brain physiology and pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as on the mechanisms of brain plasticity and neuroactive drugs. TMS applied over nonmotor areas has extended its research applications, often complementing other functional neuroimaging techniques in several fields of psychophysiology, by causally testing brain-behavior relationships. Being able to induce relatively long-lasting excitability changes, repetitive TMS has enabled the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases linked with brain excitability dysfunctions. These uses, however, warrant further large-scale studies.

- **Emerging fields of research**: TMS-EEG co-registration is considered a promising approach to evaluate corticocortical connectivity and brain reactivity with high temporal resolution. However, safety and ethical limitations of the TMS technique require a high level of vigilance.

### The neurobiological foundation of effective repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease [^111W5Pi4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

- **Potential limitations and challenges in translating preclinical evidence to patients**: Although the previous sections extensively discuss the shared neurobiological and pathophysiological mechanisms between Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models and human patients, along with promising preliminary evidence suggesting the potential for translating preclinical findings into more effective treatment strategies, several critical limitations and challenges require caution.

	- First, while preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) from a neurobiological perspective, translating these findings into consistent clinical benefits remains highly complex. Neurobiological differences likely play a key role in this regard. Indeed, animal models exhibit life cycles, metabolic processes, and neuroanatomical and physiological organization that often differ profoundly from those of humans. These differences may lead to distinct responses to non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) treatments despite the modulation of largely overlapping molecular pathways. For instance, in humans, it is possible to achieve relatively focal stimulation of specific neural targets without the confounding factors associated with the need for sedation, forced immobilization, or broader stimulation due to the considerably smaller cranial geometry of animal models. In contrast, these limitations are frequently present in preclinical studies, potentially influencing the effects of stimulation and complicating the generalization of findings to humans. Moreover, as previously discussed, animal models of disease are specifically designed to exhibit hallmark neuropathology.

### Subjective reactions of children to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation [^1147NRNF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a useful tool to investigate cortical function in childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. Magnetic stimulation is associated with a shock-like sensation that is considered painless in adults. Little is known about how children perceive the procedure. We used a self-report questionnaire to assess children's subjective experience with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Normal children and children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation in a study of cortical function in ADHD. Subjects were asked to rate transcranial magnetic stimulation on a 1 to 10 scale (most disagreeable = 1, most enjoyable = 10) and to rank it among common childhood events.

Thirty-eight subjects completed transcranial magnetic stimulation; 34 said that they would repeat it. The overall rating for transcranial magnetic stimulation was 6.13, and it was ranked fourth highest among the common childhood events. These results suggest that although a few children find transcranial magnetic stimulation uncomfortable, most consider it painless. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation neurophysiology of patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zqBSe]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of bias of the included studies is summarized in online Supplementary Fig. S1. For 'random sequence generation', the risk of bias was 'unclear' for four studies which did not mention the method of recruitment of participants. The risk of bias for 'incomplete outcome data' was 'unclear' for one study that did not specify how data were excluded. For 'selective reporting', the risk of bias was 'unclear' for all studies since we did not have access to the experimental protocols.

In addition, no specific sponsorship bias was identified for the included studies in this review, as none of the studies were funded by the private sector. Although some studies received funding from companies, those companies were not likely to affect the results because their business was not related to TMS neurophysiology. Other included studies mentioned they were funded by foundations that were not likely to introduce sponsorship bias. The other studies stated they had no conflict of interest or did not mention conflict of interest.

### Critical role of rhythms in prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression: A randomized sham-controlled study [^112VzRVk]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). High credibility.

Treatment-resistant depressive (TRD) patients, who have poor medical outcomes, account for approximately one-third of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. A number of alternatives to pharmacological treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and an alternative rTMS protocol of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), have been approved as effective treatments for TRD by the FDA in the United States and investigated in numerous studies.

Recently, one study with a large number of participants demonstrated that with an FDA-approved standard protocol, 3,000 pulses of 10 Hz rTMS and 600 pulses of iTBS had equivalent antidepressant efficacy. For these protocols, iTBS worked with just 3 minutes of stimulation and was more efficient than 37.5 minutes of 10 Hz rTMS stimulation.

In addition, our previous studies have shown that prolonged iTBS (piTBS; 1,800 pulses), which is three times longer than the standard iTBS protocol, as well as 10 Hz rTMS, had more effective antidepressant efficacy than a sham condition following a 2-week treatment session. A large double-blind, sham-controlled study has demonstrated that the responders who received rTMS showed primary enhancement during the first 2 weeks, although previous studies used 4–6 weeks rTMS treatment as a standard protocol.

### Preliminary guidelines for safe and effective use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury [^111PTY8N]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has generated extensive interest within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation community, but little work has been done with repetitive protocols that can produce prolonged changes in behavior. This is partly due to concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria.

In this article, we identify guidelines for the safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study. Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. Following stimulation, we conducted monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure.

The stimulation was well tolerated, and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, with continued improvements observed through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depression in neurologic disorders [^115637Qh]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Depression is commonly associated with neurologic disorders. Although it often negatively impacts the quality of life, it is frequently poorly managed. Some factors, such as a multidrug regimen, lack of efficacy, and side effects of antidepressants, may explain why depression is not adequately treated in patients with neurologic disorders. Therefore, this population needs new approaches for depression treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be one of these approaches because it has been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression alone and in certain neurologic diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and stroke.

rTMS is a noninvasive, focal, and painless treatment associated with few mild side effects. It may be effective in the treatment of neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. This paper discusses the potential risks and benefits of rTMS treatment for depression in Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, it proposes a framework that includes the parameters of stimulation (intensity, frequency, number of pulses, and site of stimulation) for the treatment of depression in neurologic diseases.

### Efficacy and safety of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive function for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177WRhH]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Based on existing evidence of the effects of the most commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), which includes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the cognitive improvement and safety of NIBS on schizophrenia-related cognitive impairment. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs; Review Manager, version 5.4.1, was used to perform the statistical analysis. Twenty double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trials involving 997 patients were included.

As a result, no significant improvement in cognitive function was observed after NIBS treatment. However, the overall treatment effect of the two main NIBS modes (i.e. rTMS and tDCS) was associated with significantly larger improvements in negative symptoms and good tolerability in patients with schizophrenia compared to sham-controls (SMD = -0.56, 95% CI [-1.03, -0.08], p = 0.02, I² = 88%). NIBS model and stimulus parameters influenced the effect of NIBS. More favorable effects were observed in patients who received rTMS stimulation (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI [0.01, 0.49], p = 0.04, I² = 0%) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with a stimulation intensity of 20 Hz (p = 0.004) for a period longer than 1 month (p < 0.05).

Yet, due to the limited number of included studies and heterogeneity in both study design and target population, the results of this analysis need to be interpreted with caution.

### rTMS for adolescents: Safety and efficacy considerations [^112Lq4DG]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

In light of both the FDA's clearance of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for adult major depressive disorder and concerns about the safety and efficacy of existing antidepressant therapies for adolescent depression, there is increasing interest in rTMS as a novel treatment for adolescent depression. We reviewed English-language studies using rTMS in persons under the age of 18, yielding six published reports. Since rTMS is typically delivered at or above 1 Hz for psychiatric indications, our search was confined to these frequencies. We also included studies involving rTMS above 1 Hz for non-psychiatric indications. Articles were retrieved from the MEDLINE database.

There were 19 reported subjects under age 18 who have been administered rTMS at a frequency above 1 Hz: 10 for major depression, five for spastic cerebral palsy, and four for epilepsia partialis continua. We found that most subjects responded favorably to rTMS, and no adverse events have been reported. However, data are insufficient for drawing firm conclusions about safety and efficacy. Further studies of rTMS as a treatment for adolescent depression are warranted.

### Harnessing neuroplasticity for clinical applications [^111WcBNc]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The ability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce electrical stimulation in the cortex and the hypothesis that it might produce antidepressant effects similar to electroconvulsive therapy has resulted in several studies on its efficacy for depression. Daily prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation for several weeks has been shown to have significant antidepressant effects, but additional work is needed to optimize protocols and establish and improve effect sizes. Importantly, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation effects have been shown to spread to distal anatomically connected structures across specific networks, including deeper striatal and limbic structures. Thus, cortical stimulation might induce plastic changes in the cortex directly or indirectly by modifying activity in basal ganglia networks. A key principle in neuroplasticity is the value of coupling a plasticity-promoting intervention with behavioral reinforcement; further efforts in this regard might maximize the impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on depression.

The ability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce changes in cortical function has also been examined in schizophrenia. The left temporoparietal cortex is one of several regions whose overactivity is associated with the perception of external voices in hallucinating patients. Low-frequency stimulation of the temporoparietal cortex has been used experimentally to inhibit cortical excitability and thereby quell severe, treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations with some success.

### Cognitive outcomes of TMS treatment in bipolar depression: Safety data from a randomized controlled trial [^114ZKXas]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression (BD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with marked cognitive deficits that persist even in the euthymic phase of the illness. Pharmacological treatments for BD might further aggravate cognitive impairment, highlighting the need for developing interventions that present cognitive safety. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive effects of H1-coil (deep) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: Forty-three patients were randomized to receive 20 sessions of active (55 trains, 18 Hz, 120% resting motor threshold intensity) or sham rTMS within a double-blind, sham-controlled trial. A battery of 20 neuropsychological assessments, grouped into six domains (attention and processing speed, working memory and executive function, inhibitory control, language, immediate verbal memory, and long-term verbal memory), was performed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of trial onset. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

- **Results**: Cognitive improvement was shown for all cognitive domains. It occurred regardless of intervention group and depression improvement. For the language domain, greater improvement was observed in the sham group over time. No correlations between depression (at baseline or during treatment) and cognitive improvement were found.

- **Limitations**: Absence of healthy control group.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this exploratory study provide evidence on the cognitive safety of H1-coil TMS for BD patients.

### Noninvasive brain stimulation in the study of the human visual system [^115c4q2V]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

There are currently two techniques to manipulate brain function non-invasively: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS). These brain stimulation techniques work to cause long-term change within the brain. We have been combining noninvasive brain stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the plasticity of brain networks. When fMRI is used as an outcome measure, it is possible to identify the specificity of tDCS-modulated plasticity in a visual rehabilitation protocol. Alternatively, fMRI can be used as a guide for stimulation. Brain stimulation with TMS affects neural networks, and fMRI guidance combined with an understanding of the network effects of TMS may improve TMS therapy.

### A review of the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment for depression, and current and future strategies to optimize efficacy [^114JcFtZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

There is a growing interest in extending the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) beyond research centers to the widespread clinical treatment of depression. Thus, it is timely to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of rTMS as an antidepressant treatment. Factors relevant to the efficacy of rTMS are discussed, along with their implications for further optimization of rTMS.

- **Method**: Clinical trials of the efficacy of rTMS in depressed subjects are summarized and reviewed, focusing mainly on sham-controlled studies and meta-analyses published at the time of writing.

- **Results**: There is fairly consistent statistical evidence for the superiority of rTMS over a sham control, though the degree of clinical improvement is not large. However, this data is derived mainly from two-week comparisons of rTMS versus sham, and evidence suggests greater efficacy with longer treatment courses. Studies so far have also varied greatly in their approaches to rTMS stimulation (with respect to stimulation site, stimulus parameters, etc) with little empirical evidence to inform on the relative merits of these approaches.

- **Limitations**: Only studies published in English were reviewed. Many of the studies in the literature had small sample sizes and different methodologies, making comparisons between studies difficult.

- **Conclusions**: Published studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy of rTMS as given in treatment paradigms that are almost certainly suboptimal (e.g. of two weeks' duration).

### The neurobiological foundation of effective repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease [^1134FAaY]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, nonlinear, progressive brain proteinopathy, leading to primary neurodegeneration in distinct areas of the brain. The late clinical stage of AD is typically characterized by cognitive decline and dementia, with increasing impairment of activities of daily living and loss of functional independence. Despite decades of scientific and economic efforts, the etiology remains only partly understood and characterized due to its decade-long, complex, and multifaceted pathophysiology.

	- AD is associated with a pathologically altered amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathway, with accumulation of soluble neurotoxic species that aggregate into extracellular Aβ plaques. Another core aspect of AD pathophysiology evolves through hyperphosphorylation of intracellular tau protein (pTau), spreading and producing toxic species, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments (PHF) and ultimately aggregated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are associated with regional neurodegeneration and disease progression. Furthermore, multiple intersecting molecular and cellular mechanisms, such as neuroimmune and inflammatory events, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, disruptions in neurovascular integrity, and cellular mechanisms involved in brain protein homeostasis, form the basis for phenomenological-clinical disease heterogeneity and are involved in the long and complex AD pathophysiology.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain: Guidelines for pain treatment research [^111BwQTs]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

Recognizing that electrically stimulating the motor cortex could relieve chronic pain sparked the development of noninvasive technologies. In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electromagnetic coils held against the scalp influence underlying cortical firing. Multiday repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce long-lasting, potentially therapeutic brain plasticity. Nearby ferromagnetic or electronic implants are contraindications. Adverse effects are minimal, primarily headaches. Single provoked seizures are very rare. Transcranial magnetic stimulation devices are marketed for depression and migraine in the United States and for various indications elsewhere. Although multiple studies report that high-frequency rTMS of the motor cortex reduces neuropathic pain, their quality has been insufficient to support a Food and Drug Administration application.

Harvard's Radcliffe Institute therefore sponsored a workshop to solicit advice from experts in TMS, pain research, and clinical trials. They recommended that researchers standardize and document all TMS parameters and improve strategies for sham and double blinding. Subjects should have common, well-characterized pain conditions amenable to motor cortex rTMS, and studies should be adequately powered.

- **Assessment tools**: They recommended standardized assessment tools (e.g. NIH's PROMIS) plus validated condition-specific instruments and consensus-recommended metrics (e.g. IMMPACT).
- **Outcomes**: Outcomes should include pain intensity and qualities, patient and clinician impression of change, and proportions achieving 30% and 50% pain relief.

### Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor symptoms in Parkinson disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116TjK4V]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique that has been closely examined as a possible treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, results evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS in PD are mixed, mostly owing to low statistical power or variety in individual rTMS protocols.

- **Objectives**: To determine the rTMS effects on motor dysfunction in patients with PD and to examine potential factors that modulate the rTMS effects.

- **Data sources**: Databases searched included PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 30, 2014.

- **Study selection**: Eligible studies included sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials of rTMS intervention for motor dysfunction in patients with PD.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Relevant measures were extracted independently by two investigators. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with random-effects models.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

- **Results**: Twenty studies with a total of 470 patients were included. Random-effects analysis revealed a pooled SMD of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29–0.64), indicating an overall medium effect size favoring active rTMS over sham rTMS in the reduction of motor symptoms (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect sizes estimated from high-frequency rTMS targeting the primary motor cortex (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46–1.08; p < 0.001) and low-frequency rTMS applied over other frontal regions (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.13–0.87; p = 0.008) were significant.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for schizophrenia [^114n74cx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms that fail to fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a new treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the effects of TMS alone, compared with sham TMS or with 'standard management' and any other comparison interventions in reducing psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2006, June 2008, April 2013). This register is compiled by methodical searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts, LILACS, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, and Sociofile, and is supplemented with handsearching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised controlled trials recruiting at least five participants and comparing TMS with sham TMS or any other treatment for people with schizophrenia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model. We assessed overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 41 studies with 1473 participants in the review. We found significant differences in favor of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for global state measured on the CGI scale.

### A wearable repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation device [^116uMW77]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For medical safety, we have implemented the following measures:

1. The patients are not allowed to modify the stimulation parameters of the rTMS-tiny themselves. These parameters, including pulse intensity, pulse frequency, and the number of pulses, are set through software permission settings. Each device is bound to one patient (via fingerprint, password, etc), allowing only the physician to set it based on that patient's resting state motor threshold (RMT), according to the latest IFCN rTMS safety guidelines.

2. For patients without a history of epilepsy, the probability of seizures is extremely low when rTMS is modulated using the IFCN-recommended dosages, and the technology can largely be considered safe. Over 62% of seizures occurred on the first exposure to TMS, and 75% occurred within the first three exposures. Therefore, we will set the parameters in-hospital and perform the first treatment to screen for seizure-prone patients, significantly reducing the probability of developing seizures outside the hospital.

3. An adult with proper training must be present during rTMS treatment. To avert emergencies, we have incorporated a "one-button alarm" feature in the device's companion software, enabling patients to swiftly reach the local emergency medical service team via a single action.

The future success of wearable rTMS devices will depend on collaborative efforts between clinicians, engineers, and regulatory agencies to establish standardized protocols and ensure safe, effective, and user-friendly designs. These considerations underscore the importance of balancing technological advancement with user safety.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of seizures: A controlled study [^117D3Ykm]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

To perform a controlled trial of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), twenty-four patients with localization-related epilepsy were randomized to receive either blinded active or placebo stimulation. Weekly seizure frequency was compared for an 8-week period both before and after 1 week of 1-Hz TMS administered for 15 minutes twice daily.

- **Results**: When comparing the 8-week baseline and post-stimulation periods, patients who received active treatment experienced a mean seizure frequency reduction of 0.045 ± 0.13, whereas sham-stimulated control subjects exhibited a change of -0.004 ± 0.20. Over 2 weeks, actively treated patients had a mean reduction in weekly seizure frequency of 0.16 ± 0.18, compared to 0.01 ± 0.24 in sham-stimulated control subjects. Neither difference was significant.

- **Conclusion**: The effect of TMS on seizure frequency was mild and short lived.

### Neurocardiogenic syncope complicating pediatric transcranial magnetic stimulation [^114A3WeF]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pediatric applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly expanding, but lack the safety data established for adults. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced neurocardiogenic syncope may represent an age-dependent adverse event that is essentially undescribed in the transcranial magnetic stimulation literature. We report on two adolescents (of 10 children studied) with transcranial magnetic stimulation-related neurocardiogenic syncope, identify modifiable risk factors, and suggest measures to improve the safety of future pediatric transcranial magnetic stimulation studies.

### Antidepressant efficacy of administering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods: A scoping review and meta-analysis [^115kzBMU]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To optimize the antidepressant efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is important to examine the impact of brain state during therapeutic rTMS. Evidence suggests that brain state can modulate the brain's response to stimulation, potentially diminishing antidepressant efficacy if left uncontrolled or enhancing it with inexpensive psychological or other non-pharmacological methods.

Thus, we conducted a PRISMA-ScR-based scoping review to pool studies administering rTMS with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 10 July 2024. Inclusion criteria included neuropsychiatric patients who underwent rTMS; studies assessed depressive symptom severity; non-pharmacological tasks or interventions were administered during rTMS, or did not include a wash-out period. Of 8,442 studies, 20 combined rTMS with aerobic exercise, bright light therapy, cognitive training or reactivation, psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, or a psychophysical task.

Meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted based on change scores on standardized scales. The effect size was large and therapeutic for uncontrolled pretest-posttest comparisons (17 studies, Hedges' g = -1.91, standard error (SE) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.80 to -1.03, p < 0.01); medium when studies compared active combinations with sham rTMS plus active non-pharmacological methods (8 studies, g = -0.55, SE = 0.14, 95% CI = -0.82 to -0.28, p < 0.01); and non-significant when active combinations were compared with active rTMS plu.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization [^1155nq46]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The most common form of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). It consists of a brief discharge of an electric current through a coil, inducing a focal magnetic field that penetrates the scalp and skull, secondarily generating an electric current in accordance with Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction. Depending on the frequency of stimulation with repetitive TMS (rTMS), either excitation (≥ 5 Hz: high-frequency rTMS) or inhibition (≤ 1 Hz: low-frequency rTMS) of the underlying neuronal activity of the stimulated area can be induced.

Although rTMS is widely used, clinical guidelines state a level A evidence (definite efficacy) only for the management of few pathologies, such as neuropathic pain, depression, and hand motor recovery in the post-acute stages of stroke. Evidence is less strong, yet promising, for the use of TMS in other pathologies, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

On the other hand, the use of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still debated due to considerable heterogeneity across studies and protocols. This relates back to the lack of:

- **Standardized stimulation parameters**: Including intensity, frequency, and duration of intervention.
- **Knowledge of the optimal stimulation site**: Critical for effective treatment.
- **Recruitment of large, well-characterized cohorts**: Essential with a biomarker-confirmed diagnosis.

Due to these limitations, the FDA has not yet granted clearance for the commercial use of TMS devices in the treatment of AD pathology, as the amount of evidence collected so far is still not sufficient to clearly state its effectiveness at the clinical level.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of non-surgical brain stimulation for the acute treatment of major depressive episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111ShpPf]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Two trials evaluated the antidepressant efficacy of magnetic seizure therapy compared with moderate dose right unilateral ECT, and one trial compared magnetic seizure therapy with high dose right unilateral ECT. Although we found no evidence of differences between treatments in pairwise meta-analysis, the network meta-analysis of response provides preliminary evidence in favour of magnetic seizure therapy compared with sham therapy. This estimate is, however, accompanied by a high level of uncertainty and relies on indirect evidence only. As such, a sham controlled trial is needed to confirm this finding.

Consistent with previous analyses, our results provide evidence for the antidepressant efficacy of high frequency left and low frequency right repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The efficacy of bilateral rTMS is comparable to both high frequency left and low frequency right rTMS, with little evidence for additional benefit of bilateral compared with unilateral stimulation. Overall, the treatment effect estimates of these protocols are more precise than those of most other treatment protocols included in our review. The finding that neither low frequency left nor high frequency right rTMS were more efficacious than sham therapy lends support to the view that the antidepressant effects of rTMS depend on specific stimulation frequency and coil location.

We found limited evidence in support of the more recent treatment modalities. Compared with sham therapy, intermittent theta burst stimulation and priming transcranial magnetic stimulation were associated with.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: a narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^114pnsyz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment used to address certain neurological and psychological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression, by inducing depolarization of the neurons in the brain. This is achieved by transmitting a strong current through a wire from a machine to a circular wire, which initiates a magnetic field in a perpendicular direction based on Faraday's law of induction. When the circular wire is applied to the scalp, the time-changing magnetic field induces a current in the axons beneath the scalp, running in the opposite direction to the current in the coil, thereby stimulating the brain tissue.

There are three main types of TMS: single-pulse TMS, paired-pulse TMS, and trains of repetitive stimuli (repetitive TMS, or rTMS). This article will focus solely on rTMS. Typically, a single-pulse TMS lasts for only a few seconds. Therefore, to prolong its effects, repetitive TMS is used. rTMS works by firing the single-pulse stimuli repeatedly at a specific frequency, intensity, and time duration, either to inhibit or to stimulate the activity of a specific cortical area that is targeted. In rTMS, two different subgroups can be used for treatment based on their purpose. One is high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS), with frequencies ≥ 5 Hz, whereas the other is low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS), with frequencies ≤ 1 Hz. HF-rTMS can increase cortical excitability, MEP size (i.e. motor-evoked potential, an electric potential in the motor pathway induced by TMS), and provoke intercellular interactions.

### Unlocking the potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to optimize intervention strategies [^1146uWdZ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition marked by a gradual decline in cognitive abilities and deterioration of daily life skills. It is the most common form of dementia, responsible for 50–70% of cases, and is primarily characterized by severe memory impairment relative to age-matched peers. The global incidence of AD and its continuum — encompassing prodromal and preclinical AD — is estimated to affect 32 million, 69 million, and 315 million individuals, respectively. Collectively, this represents a significant population of 416 million individuals within the AD spectrum, approximately 22% of the global population aged ≥ 50 years.

In the geriatric cohort, AD accounts for 4.9% of total mortality and poses an additional 40% heightened risk of mortality, particularly among female individuals. With advancing age, the susceptibility to AD increases, accompanied by a parallel rise in disease burden and mortality risks. Consequently, there is an imperative demand for an efficacious therapeutic approach to combat AD.

### Assessment and management of concurrent substance use in patients receiving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for depressive, obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, and trauma-related disorders: A Delphi consensus study and guideline [^114HHsMF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Limited data are available to inform clinicians on how to manage substance use in the context of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depressive, obsessive-compulsive, psychotic, or trauma-related disorders. The authors convened an international panel of 24 rTMS experts, representative of different geographic regions and subspecialties, and created a consensus guideline for clinicians and researchers on approaches to substance use in patients receiving rTMS as treatment for primary psychiatric disorders.

- **Methods**: A Delphi method survey and expert opinion were elicited over consecutive rounds of surveys, with feedback and discussion after each round. Recommendation statements were established upon very high (≥ 80%) agreement.

- **Results**: Three rounds of surveys and feedback were sufficient to reach a consensus for most topics. Where consensus could not be reached, the panel discussed limitations in the evidence base. Informed by a synthesis of the literature and practice-based evidence, the expert panel provides several consensus recommendations on the topics of screening, monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation associated with various degrees of substance use, and specific considerations for alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and opioids. Instead of excluding all persons who use substances, a nuanced approach should be taken based on an assessment of risk factors for clinical instability and severity of use. The most important safety risk with substance use is the presence of intoxication.

### Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115reK86]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is common in middle-aged individuals. It results from a progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, primarily in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The motor symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, tremor, hypertonia, and gait disorder; non-motor symptoms manifest as cognitive impairment and issues with emotional processing, including depression, apathy, visual dysfunction, and even cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.

There are various pharmacologic treatments, including levodopa therapy, to alleviate PD symptoms. However, these medications sometimes fail to provide the desired effects or may induce motor complications, such as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs), especially with chronic use. Therefore, it is essential to explore alternative and promising PD treatments, such as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Our studies have demonstrated various neuroimaging markers and their relative neuropathogenesis in PD, which appear to contribute to motor and non-motor dysfunctions and discriminative aspects. Additionally, our recent research on the genetics and anti-neuroinflammatory therapy of PD propels the need to conduct a meta-analysis on non-pharmacological therapies for PD.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a form of NIBS, exhibits neuromodulation effects. In rTMS intervention, a wire coil generates a magnetic field that passes through the scalp and skull to alter cortical excitability based on the frequency.

### Imaging the effective networks associated with cortical function through intracranial high-frequency stimulation [^113jmGgt]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical effects**: Multiple stimulation trials were performed, gradually increasing the intensity from 0.1 to 3 mA, usually in steps of 0.25 mA. Wider steps of 0.5 or even 1 mA may have been used if repeated anterior stimulations did not elicit any effect. In addition, narrow steps of 0.1 mA were used when a clinical effect was obtained at low intensities or when there was a need to choose between simultaneous multimodal clinical effects. The upper limit was set by the presence of a clinical or electrical response, such as after discharges. If none of these were obtained, the upper limit was set by default to 3 mA, which generates the maximum charge-per-density allowed in our setup.

Patients were instructed to report any psychological or physical changes they experienced during or after each stimulation. Furthermore, patients were also engaged in different tasks during the stimulation session, such as repetitive movements of the limbs to test for motor deficits, or reading and counting to test for language or attentional deficits. Tasks were selected based on the region stimulated. For instance, if the contacts were placed in the proximity of the motor area (primary or secondary), patients were asked to perform a repetitive movement and to count. Tasks had no interpatient variability. The electrical stimulation was delivered for 1–3 seconds after the clinical testing started. In many situations, the stimulation was repeated to confirm the reproducibility of the observed effects. Sham stimulation was applied to rule out subjective manifestations.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization [^111uPkvf]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In a second set of analyses, we compared additional protocol characteristics (i.e. different number of stimulation sites, pulse frequency, number of stimuli delivered, number of treatment sessions, concomitant cognitive training during stimulation) and participants' characteristics (e.g. educational level) to identify other factors that might modulate the success of high-frequency rTMS protocols in AD. Despite other neurostimulation interventions being routinely applied in an attempt to ameliorate AD symptomatology (e.g. transcranial electrical stimulation), TMS shows the highest potential effectiveness. For this reason, we decided to only review studies employing this methodology.

### High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on overall cognition in patients with poststroke cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EC92J]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

The aim of the study is to comprehensively assess the recovery effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with poststroke cognitive impairment.

- **Methods**: Six English and four Chinese databases were searched for relevant studies published up to January 2022. Randomized controlled trials of patients with poststroke cognitive impairment treated with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation were included. Included studies were assessed for the risk of bias through the Cochrane Intervention Systematic Review Manual 5.1.0. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed.

- **Results**: Sixty-one randomized controlled trials (4012 patients) were included. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score, Mini-Mental State Examination score, event-related potential P300 (P300) amplitude, Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment score, and total effective rate of cognitive function were higher in the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the control group at the end of the treatment period. Scores of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and P300 latency were lower in the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the control group. Fifty studies had selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as the stimulation site for high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

- **Conclusions**: Compared with nonrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation shows significant improvements in cognitive function for patients with poststroke cognitive impairment.
