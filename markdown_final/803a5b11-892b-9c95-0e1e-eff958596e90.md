## Question

What is bronchiectasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what bronchiectasis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and whether it is a radiologic sign, a clinical syndrome, or both. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and the "vicious cycle/vortex" concept. Next, I will review the clinical phenotype and diagnostic criteria, including imaging thresholds and pediatric nuances. After that, I need to consider etiologies and the principle of identifying treatable traits. Finally, I will synthesize the disease burden, prognosis, and why heterogeneity matters for management and research, making sure I double-check any claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't overstate anything. Bronchiectasis is both a radiologic appearance and a clinical syndrome characterized by abnormal, permanent dilation of the bronchi, typically confirmed on high-resolution chest CT, and accompanied by chronic productive cough and recurrent infections; importantly, many contemporary frameworks require both clinical and radiologic criteria to define clinically significant bronchiectasis, which I should explicitly anchor to consensus statements and primers [^c68fe483] [^a5f7d6ee] [^3c7f2c8f].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. The disease is driven by a self-perpetuating cycle — historically a "vicious circle", now often described as a "vicious vortex" — wherein impaired mucociliary clearance leads to mucus stasis, chronic bacterial infection, neutrophilic inflammation, and progressive destruction of the bronchial wall with irreversible dilation; this structural injury further impairs clearance, sustaining the cycle and causing declining lung function over time [^a5f7d6ee] [^c2ac9b96] [^873c301e].

> I need to check the clinical phenotype next. Patients typically present with a chronic productive or "wet" cough lasting more than 8 weeks, purulent sputum, recurrent chest infections, dyspnea, wheeze, chest pain, fatigue, and occasionally hemoptysis; exacerbations are defined by a worsening of these symptoms beyond day-to-day variability and often drive healthcare utilization and quality-of-life impairment, so I should confirm that these features align with guideline definitions and patient-facing summaries [^a5f7d6ee] [^032d876f] [^3c7f2c8f].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and imaging thresholds. The diagnosis rests on compatible symptoms plus radiologic confirmation, most often by HRCT showing bronchial dilation, lack of normal tapering, and the signet-ring sign (bronchus larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery); in adults, an inner airway-to-artery ratio ≥ 1.0 is commonly used, whereas in children a lower pediatric-specific threshold (> 0.8) is recommended, and I should note that many adult criteria lack robust validation and age-specific norms, which complicates both diagnosis and trial outcomes [^c68fe483] [^464ac880] [^100935cb] [^434d8b54].

> Let me consider etiologies carefully, because management hinges on identifying treatable traits. Up to 40–50% of cases remain idiopathic despite evaluation; recognized causes include post-infectious injury, immunodeficiency (especially antibody deficiencies), primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, chronic aspiration, and obstructive lesions; importantly, COPD and bronchiectasis frequently coexist, and standardized ROSE criteria help define bronchiectasis–COPD overlap, which carries worse outcomes and different therapeutic implications [^a5f7d6ee] [^c5f8eaf6] [^b8abbc1c] [^93fa0b9e].

> I should double-check the principle of treatable traits, since it shapes modern care. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, management targets specific drivers: airway clearance for mucus stasis, antibiotics for chronic infection (including macrolides or inhaled agents in selected patients), anti-inflammatory strategies when indicated, and disease-specific therapies such as immunoglobulin replacement, CFTR modulators in CF, or eradication protocols for Pseudomonas; this precision framing is emphasized in contemporary reviews and guidelines and is essential given the marked heterogeneity of phenotypes and endotypes [^c2ac9b96] [^b3514a6e] [^dc9ce053].

> Next, I should review disease burden and prognosis to contextualize why early recognition matters. Prevalence estimates vary but are rising with improved detection, with hundreds of thousands affected in the US alone; patients experience frequent exacerbations, impaired quality of life, and accelerated lung function decline, and severe exacerbations carry substantial short- and intermediate-term mortality; in-hospital mortality during acute exacerbations is around 9% and 1-year mortality near 30% in some cohorts, underscoring the need for proactive prevention and optimization of care [^3c7f2c8f] [^ae86e554] [^5450d2ac].

> But wait, what if I overstated irreversibility in children? I should correct that. While bronchiectasis is classically considered irreversible, pediatric data show that early, mild bronchiectasis can regress with aggressive treatment of infection and inflammation, and some children with chronic suppurative lung disease (a precursor state) can improve or even normalize on follow-up imaging; this is a key reason to maintain a high index of suspicion and intervene early in children with chronic wet cough [^c6d37552] [^650d606c] [^6cd78e75].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. Bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous chronic airway disease defined by permanent bronchial dilation on CT plus a clinical syndrome of chronic productive cough and recurrent infections, driven by a self-perpetuating infection–inflammation–structural injury vortex; diagnosis requires both clinical and radiologic criteria, with pediatric-specific imaging thresholds and a broad etiologic workup to uncover treatable traits; management is multimodal and precision-oriented, aiming to break the vicious cycle, reduce exacerbations, stabilize lung function, and improve quality of life, while recognizing that disease heterogeneity and limited high-quality evidence remain major challenges to optimal care and trial design [^c68fe483] [^a5f7d6ee] [^c2ac9b96].

Bronchiectasis is a **chronic lung disease** characterized by **irreversible dilation of the bronchi** [^a5f7d6ee] due to repeated infection and inflammation, leading to impaired mucus clearance and persistent cough with sputum production [^3c7f2c8f]. It is diagnosed by **high-resolution chest CT** [^434d8b54] showing bronchial dilation and wall thickening, and managed with airway clearance, antibiotics, and treatment of underlying causes [^b3514a6e]; prognosis varies with severity and exacerbation frequency [^4c842b06].

---

## Pathophysiology

Bronchiectasis arises from a **vicious cycle** of infection, inflammation, and structural damage [^a5f7d6ee]:

- **Infection and inflammation**: Recurrent infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) cause chronic airway inflammation, leading to bronchial wall damage and dilation [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Impaired mucociliary clearance**: Inflammation and structural damage impair mucus clearance, causing mucus stasis and further infection [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Structural damage**: Chronic inflammation and infection cause bronchial wall fibrosis, cartilage destruction, and permanent dilation [^40009eae].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with the following **symptoms and signs**:

- **Chronic productive cough**: Persistent cough with copious sputum production, often purulent [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Recurrent infections**: Frequent lower respiratory tract infections [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up blood due to airway wall damage [^3c7f2c8f].
- **Dyspnea and wheeze**: Shortness of breath and wheezing due to airway obstruction [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, weight loss, and clubbing in advanced disease [^notfound].

---

## Etiology

Bronchiectasis has diverse **etiologies**, including:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Recurrent pneumonia <br/> - Tuberculosis <br/> - Whooping cough [^ae86e554] |
| Genetic | - Cystic fibrosis <br/> - Primary ciliary dyskinesia <br/> - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^c5f8eaf6] |
| Immunological | - Immunoglobulin deficiencies <br/> - HIV/AIDS <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis [^c5f8eaf6] |
| Structural | - Congenital airway anomalies <br/> - Foreign body aspiration <br/> - Tumors [^103c2c7f] |
| Idiopathic | Unknown causes (up to 40% of cases) [^3c7f2c8f] |

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation and imaging**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Chronic productive cough, recurrent infections, and characteristic physical findings [^a5f7d6ee].
- **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)**: Gold standard for diagnosis, showing bronchial dilation, wall thickening, and lack of tapering [^434d8b54].
- **Sputum culture**: Identifies chronic bacterial colonization, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^4cf9eca1].
- **Pulmonary function tests**: Assess severity of airflow obstruction and lung function impairment [^c5f8eaf6].

---

## Management

Management is **multidisciplinary** and individualized:

- **Airway clearance**: Physiotherapy, postural drainage, and devices to improve mucus clearance [^98653661].
- **Antibiotics**: Long-term or intermittent antibiotics to reduce bacterial load and exacerbations [^e3f9fd6b].
- **Macrolide therapy**: Anti-inflammatory macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) reduce exacerbations [^6b2fa112].
- **Treatment of underlying causes**: Immunoglobulin replacement, CFTR modulators, or surgical intervention when indicated [^c5f8eaf6].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and pertussis vaccines to prevent infections [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with disease severity, exacerbation frequency, and underlying etiology [^4c842b06]. Mild disease may have a **normal life expectancy**, whereas severe disease carries increased risks of recurrent exacerbations, respiratory failure, and mortality [^87b1ea77]. Exacerbations significantly impair quality of life and increase healthcare utilization [^2404d899].

---

Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease with **permanent bronchial dilation** from repeated infection and inflammation, causing chronic cough, recurrent infections, and impaired quality of life. Diagnosis is by HRCT, and management focuses on airway clearance, antibiotics, and treating underlying causes; prognosis depends on severity and exacerbation control [^a5f7d6ee].

### Criteria and definitions for the radiological and clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults for use in clinical trials: international consensus recommendations [^c68fe483]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to both a clinical disease and a radiological appearance that has multiple causes and can be associated with a range of conditions. Disease heterogeneity and the absence of standardised definitions have hampered clinical trials of treatments for bronchiectasis and are important challenges in clinical practice. In view of the need for new therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis to reduce the disease burden, we established an international taskforce of experts to develop recommendations and definitions for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults to facilitate the standardisation of terminology for clinical trials. Systematic reviews were used to inform discussions, and Delphi processes were used to achieve expert consensus. We prioritised criteria for the radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis and suggest recommendations on the use and central reading of chest CT scans to confirm the presence of bronchiectasis for clinical trials. Furthermore, we developed a set of consensus statements concerning the definitions of clinical bronchiectasis and its specific signs and symptoms, as well as definitions for chronic bacterial infection and sustained culture conversion. The diagnosis of clinically significant bronchiectasis requires both clinical and radiological criteria, and these expert recommendations and proposals should help to optimise patient recruitment into clinical trials and allow reliable comparisons of treatment effects among different interventions for bronchiectasis. Our consensus proposals should also provide a framework for future research to further refine definitions and establish definitive guidance on the diagnosis of bronchiectasis.

### Bronchiectasis in children: diagnosis and treatment [^c6d37552]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Bronchiectasis is conventionally defined as irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. Bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis is an increasingly appreciated cause of chronic respiratory-related morbidity worldwide. Few randomised controlled trials provide high-level evidence for management strategies to treat the children affected by bronchiectasis. However, both decades-old and more recent studies using technological advances support the notion that prompt diagnosis and optimal management of paediatric bronchiectasis is particularly important in early childhood. Although considered to be of a non-reversible nature, mild bronchiectasis determined by radiography might be reversible at any age if treated early, and the lung function decline associated with disease progression could then be halted. Although some management strategies are extrapolated from cystic fibrosis or adult-based studies, or both, non-cystic fibrosis paediatric-specific data to help diagnose and manage these children still need to be generated. We present current knowledge and an updated definition of bronchiectasis, and review controversies relating to the management of children with bronchiectasis, including applying the concept of so-called treatable traits.

### Pediatric bronchiectasis: No longer an orphan disease [^0e67a5fa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is described classically as a chronic pulmonary disorder characterized by a persistent productive cough and irreversible dilatation of one or more bronchi. However, in children unable to expectorate, cough may instead be wet and intermittent and bronchial dilatation reversible in the early stages. Although still considered an orphan disease, it is being recognized increasingly as causing significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults in both affluent and developing countries. While bronchiectasis has multiple etiologies, the final common pathway involves a complex interplay between the host, respiratory pathogens and environmental factors. These interactions lead to a vicious cycle of repeated infections, airway inflammation and tissue remodelling resulting in impaired airway clearance, destruction of structural elements within the bronchial wall causing them to become dilated and small airway obstruction. In this review, the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathobiology, clinical features, and management of bronchiectasis in children are summarized. Recent evidence has emerged to improve our understanding of this heterogeneous disease including the role of viruses, and how antibiotics, novel drugs, antiviral agents, and vaccines might be used. Importantly, the management is no longer dependent upon extrapolating from the cystic fibrosis experience. Nevertheless, substantial information gaps remain in determining the underlying disease mechanisms that initiate and sustain the pathophysiological pathways leading to bronchiectasis. National and international collaborations, standardizing definitions of clinical and research end points, and exploring novel primary prevention strategies are needed if further progress is to be made in understanding, treating and even preventing this often life-limiting disease.

### Bronchiectasis [^de0be2a6]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is an important clinical syndrome because of its increasing prevalence, substantial economic burden on health care, and associated morbidity. Until recently, the disease was considered an orphan and essentially neglected from a therapeutic standpoint, but many recent advances have been made in the field. Several national registries have formed to provide databases from which to study patients with bronchiectasis. Experts published a consensus definition of a bronchiectasis-specific exacerbation that will serve as a unified definition for future clinical trials. Several inhaled antibiotic trials aimed at reducing exacerbation frequency have been completed. Researchers have investigated nonculture techniques, such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and whole genome sequencing, to characterize the microbiological characteristics. Studies of anti-Pseudomonas antibodies are providing interesting insight into varying host responses to chronic Pseudomonas infection. After three successful trials demonstrating that macrolides reduce exacerbations in bronchiectasis, other antiinflammatory agents have been investigated, and a trial of a novel antiinflammatory drug is ongoing. A relatively robust study has been published in airway clearance, a therapy that is accepted universally as beneficial but that has never been accompanied by strong evidence. To build on the successes with bronchiectasis thus far, investigators must develop better definitions of phenotypes of bronchiectasis. In this regard, clinical tools have been developed to quantify disease severity and predict prognosis. Studies of different clinical phenotypes of bronchiectasis in patients with bronchiectasis have been published. With continued advances in the field of bronchiectasis, there is hope that evidenced-based therapies will become available.

### Bronchiectasis update [^2495c504]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchiectasis, once thought to be an orphan disease, is being diagnosed with increased frequency in the United States and around the world. The present review aims to provide an update on recent publications on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.

Recent Findings

Two large bronchiectasis patient registries have published initial reports regarding demographics and other patient data in 2017. Updates on the microbiology, microbiome, and inflammation in patients with bronchiectasis are clarifying the complexities of airway infection in this disease. A consensus definition of 'exacerbation' in bronchiectasis has been agreed upon this year. Reports on novel treatments, including the repurposing of older therapies, have also been published in 2016–2017. A new European guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis is also now available.

Summary

Bronchiectasis, a resurgent disease, is now being better defined with a rapidly expanding portfolio of demographic, clinical, and therapeutic research and publications.

### The precision medicine era of bronchiectasis [^c2ac9b96]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A key lesson learned over the past 100-plus years is the challenge of the inherent heterogeneity clinical disease presents: there is no typical patient with bronchiectasis, and no two patients are the same. Underlying this is the multitude of different etiologies (where identifiable), with up to half of all cases considered idiopathic. A major clinical challenge remains: two patients with comparable symptoms may have contrasting severity, comorbidities, microbiology, inflammation, and radiological findings. Further complicating clinical management are the different impacts of quality of life (QOL), adherence, and social circumstances that affect disease course, disease trajectory, and progression. Compounding this is the increasing burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems, exacerbated by decades of neglect, orphan-disease status, underrecognition, and underdiagnosis. There remain no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis, and many interventions used lack evidence. Although matters are improving through clinical trials (Figure 1A), therapeutic development is undermined by disease heterogeneity, a lack of experimental models, and an urgent need for a better, more fundamental understanding of pathogenesis.

Many accept that bronchiectasis represents a final common outcome from several variable and discrete causes. Defining something on the basis of its final endpoint is deeply flawed and has contributed to the challenges the field has experienced. Defining a student's potential on the basis of a single examination fails to ignore the learning journey or effort, while looking at the success of a product solely on the basis of sales numbers ignores the research, development, and innovation that led to its creation. Similarly, we must consider the origins and processes that have led to bronchiectasis in individual cases, or at the very least small groups, to better understand pathogenesis and the potential for successful intervention. The exponential growth in epidemiological work, international registries, translational research, and clinical trials now allows us to appreciate its pathogenesis as a vicious "vortex" rather than a "cycle" in which key components of infection, inflammation, and epithelial and mucociliary dysfunction intersect with structural disease in varying ways concurrently rather than sequentially, to different extents and at variable degrees of complexity that differ by individual, time, and environment. This concept requires further refinement to elevate our understanding to the individual level: the era of precision medicine in bronchiectasis.

### Towards development of evidence to inform recommendations for the evaluation and management of bronchiectasis [^e024f09e]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis (BE) is a chronic condition characterized by airway dilation as a consequence of a variety of pathogenic processes. It is often associated with persistent airway infection and an inflammatory response resulting in cough productive of purulent sputum, which has an adverse impact on quality of life. The prevalence of BE is increasing worldwide. Treatment guidelines exist for managing BE, but they are generally informed by a paucity of high-quality evidence. This review presents the findings of a scientific advisory board of experts held in the United States in November 2020. The main focus of the meeting was to identify unmet needs in BE and propose ways to identify research priorities for the management of BE, with a view to developing evidence-based treatment recommendations. Key issues identified include diagnosis, patient evaluation, promoting airway clearance and appropriate use of antimicrobials. Unmet needs include effective pharmacological agents to promote airway clearance and reduce inflammation, control of chronic infection, clinical endpoints to be used in the design of BE clinical trials, and more accurate classification of patients using phenotypes and endotypes to better guide treatment decisions and improve outcomes.

### Bronchiectasis [^809963c5]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis, which was once thought to be an orphan disease, is now being recognized with increasing frequency around the world. Patients with bronchiectasis have chronic cough and sputum production, and bacterial infections develop in them that result in the loss of lung function. Bronchiectasis occurs in patients across the spectrum of age and gender, but the highest prevalence is in older women. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made by high-resolution CT scans. Bronchiectasis, which can be focal or diffuse, may occur without antecedent disease but is often a complication of previous lung infection or injury or is due to underlying systemic illnesses. Patients with bronchiectasis may have predisposing congenital disease, immune disorders, or inflammatory disease. The treatment of bronchiectasis is multimodality, and includes therapy with antibiotics, antiinflammatory agents, and airway clearance. Resectional surgery and lung transplantation are rarely required. The prognosis for patients with bronchiectasis is variable given the heterogeneous nature of the disease. A tailored, patient-focused approach is needed to optimally evaluate and treat individuals with bronchiectasis.

### Paediatric bronchiectasis in Europe: what now and where next? [^b1abd4ec]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis has been defined as the abnormal and permanent dilation of bronchi. It has a variety of causes and has traditionally been viewed as a condition that is irreversible, often progressive and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the past, patients had relatively advanced disease by the time the diagnosis was established. By using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning of the chest, the potential now exists for the much earlier detection and treatment of children with lesser degrees of bronchial dilation and bronchial wall thickening than was previously possible. In some, the HRCT changes have been seen to improve or completely resolve. This calls into question exactly what now should be termed bronchiectasis and how the parents of children with such HRCT findings should be counselled about the likely prognosis and the necessary or desirable treatment options.

### Bronchiectasis: new therapies and new perspectives [^dc9ce053]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

European Respiratory Society guidelines for the management of adult bronchiectasis highlight the paucity of treatment options available for patients with this disorder. No treatments have been licensed by regulatory agencies worldwide, and most therapies used in clinical practice are based on very little evidence. Development of new treatments is needed urgently. We did a systematic review of scientific literature and clinical trial registries to identify agents in early-to-late clinical development for bronchiectasis in adults. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and potential roles of emerging therapies, including drugs that target airway and systemic inflammation, mucociliary clearance, and epithelial dysfunction. To ensure these treatments achieve success in randomised clinical trials-and therefore reach patients-we propose a reassessment of the current approach to bronchiectasis. Although understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is at an early stage, we argue that bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous disease with many different biological mechanisms that drive disease progression (endotypes), and therefore the so-called treatable traits approach used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could be applied to bronchiectasis, with future trials targeted at the specific disease subgroups most likely to benefit.

### Bronchiectasis: an emerging global epidemic [^9dd8b9d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis has an increasing profile within respiratory medicine. This chronic and irreversible airways disease is common but suffers from a lack of evidenced based therapy for patients and, a lack of understanding of its inherent heterogeneity. Research focused on bronchiectasis must therefore be prioritized if we are to adequately address this evolving clinical problem. This special issue on bronchiectasis focuses on its clinical, microbiological and therapeutic aspects. By bringing together a unique collection of original research and review articles, we hope this issue will showcase international research efforts, encourage future research collaborations and stimulate debate. In doing so, we hope to bring greater attention to the urgent need for sustained investment into focused, dedicated and collaborative research platforms in bronchiectasis, an emerging "global epidemic".

### The precision medicine era of bronchiectasis [^bafe6e47]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A Decade of Advances in Bronchiectasis Education, Research, and Clinical Care

We have observed exponential growth in the quantity and quality of bronchiectasis education, research, and clinical care. Central to this are clinical trials, resulting in a strong drug development pipeline addressing various aspects of the "vicious vortex" (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite the advances and promise, many clinical trials have failed to reach their primary endpoints. The lack of available "evidence-based" treatments and the failure of bronchiectasis clinical trials are intimately linked to disease heterogeneity, whether clinical, radiological, microbiological, or immunological. Selection of the right patients for the right intervention at the right time is central to appropriately addressing this challenge, one that necessitates fresh approaches to understanding, stratifying, and classifying bronchiectasis to optimally measure "treatment response". Several important issues differentiate bronchiectasis from other respiratory diseases.

First, trialists (and regulators) must concur on optimal "endpoints", with QOL, exacerbations, and lung function used frequently. QOL in bronchiectasis is measured using various tools, each examining varying domains and requiring distinct analyses; exacerbations can have variable definitions and durations of follow-up, while lung function (as FEV₁) is nonresponsive to most interventions. Even microbiology-related endpoints, significant in phase II studies, have uncertain relationships with concurrent clinical assessment. Clinical measures among "responders" further vary, and therefore biomarkers, each assessing different endpoints, to advance precision in bronchiectasis are required.

Second, no single variable encompasses the severity of bronchiectasis in individual cases, and therefore multidimensional approaches have been established, including the bronchiectasis severity index, and the FACED (including FEV₁, age, the presence of chronic colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, radiological extension [number of pulmonary lobes affected], and dyspnea) and E-FACED (also including the number or severity of exacerbations) scores, which incorporate clinical, radiological, microbiological, and functional assessment. This poses challenges when interpreting translation to treatment efficacy.

Third, significant placebo responses are observed in bronchiectasis trials, especially for QOL measures, posing difficulties in optimizing trial design and power.

Fourth, identifying responders to specific interventions (i.e. mucoactive, antibiotic, or antiinflammatory) remains challenging, as those experiencing symptomatic amelioration may show no change in exacerbation frequency or severity or vice versa. Those with smoking histories are less likely to demonstrate "responsiveness", exposing the relevance of coexisting smoking related lung diseases such as COPD.

### Pediatric bronchiectasis: priorities, precision medicine, and transition to adult care [^0037b5de]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing recognition of pediatric bronchiectasis, a clinical syndrome of chronic or recurrent wet cough with pediatric-defined abnormal airway dilatation on high-resolution chest computed tomography scans, and its global burden has led to greater awareness of this condition, previously believed to be an orphan disease. Greater availability and accessibility of computed tomography scanners to provide the objective diagnosis with an increased bronchoarterial ratio of dilated airways have likely contributed to this awareness. Recently estimated total healthcare costs for a child with bronchiectasis were U.S. $23,687 annually, with an estimated aggregate cost in Australia of U.S. $17.77 million, which pales in comparison with the cost of bronchiectasis to the U.S. health system (estimated annual total cost U.S. $14.7 billion). From this growing interest, one of the most significant developments of recent times has been the establishment of international registries and collaborations, including the Children's Bronchiectasis Education Advocacy and Research Network. Such collaborations have led to the development of pediatric-specific international management guidelines, consensus-based quality standards for management, definitions of exacerbations, a consumer-focused core outcome set, and other measures. These international evidence-based statements are expected to improve research through using these patient and/or parent-oriented outputs. What then are our current research priorities in pediatric bronchiectasis for the decade ahead?

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^3abf5ce6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is the third most common chronic inflammatory airway disease, after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma with a prevalence clearly underestimated probably because of its clinical similitudes with other chronic airway diseases. Bronchiectasis can be caused by a dozen of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases and a variable number and severity of exacerbations can appear throughout its natural history, usually with an infectious profile. The dilation of the airway and the inflammation/infection is their radiological and pathophysiological hallmarks. Primary Care should play an important play in many aspects of the bronchiectasis assessment. In this article, we will try to offer a series of important concepts and practical tips on some key aspects of the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis in Primary Care: clinical suspicion, diagnostic methods, severity assessment, overlap with asthma and COPD and microbiological and therapeutic aspects.

### Bronchiectasis [^a5f7d6ee]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to abnormal dilatation of the bronchi. Airway dilatation can lead to failure of mucus clearance and increased risk of infection. Pathophysiological mechanisms of bronchiectasis include persistent bacterial infections, dysregulated immune responses, impaired mucociliary clearance and airway obstruction. These mechanisms can interact and self-perpetuate, leading over time to impaired lung function. Patients commonly present with productive cough and recurrent chest infections, and the diagnosis of bronchiectasis is based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings. Bronchiectasis can be the result of several different underlying disorders, and identifying the aetiology is crucial to guide management. Treatment is directed at reducing the frequency of exacerbations, improving quality of life and preventing disease progression. Although no therapy is licensed for bronchiectasis by regulatory agencies, evidence supports the effectiveness of airway clearance techniques, antibiotics and mucolytic agents, such as inhaled isotonic or hypertonic saline, in some patients. Bronchiectasis is a disabling disease with an increasing prevalence and can affect individuals of any age. A major challenge is the application of emerging phenotyping and endotyping techniques to identify the patient populations who would most benefit from a specific treatment, with the goal of better targeting existing and emerging treatments and achieving better outcomes.

### To boldly Go into molecular endotypes of bronchiectasis exacerbations [^2404d899]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Exacerbations are bad events in bronchiectasis. They result in acute physician visits, medication costs, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. As a result, exacerbations are the primary driver of the high healthcare costs associated with bronchiectasis. The economic toll levied by bronchiectasis exacerbations is a global problem, and it affects children and adults alike. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of exacerbations imposes an unsettling uncertainty on the lives of patients with bronchiectasis and robs them of quality of life. Given the importance of bronchiectasis exacerbations, they are the standard outcome measure in clinical trials of desperately needed therapeutic drugs for patients with bronchiectasis. The importance of exacerbations, however, is matched by their complexity. Bronchiectasis is arguably the most heterogeneous of all diseases, with most cases occurring for unknown reasons. It involves complex pathophysiologic connections and manifests varied endotypes. Therefore, it is not surprising that bronchiectasis exacerbations are themselves multifarious. Even though there is a published consensus definition of bronchiectasis exacerbations, they are often elusive targets in the vastly heterogeneous pool of patients with bronchiectasis. From the standpoint of the clinician caring for patients with bronchiectasis, there is a tremendous desire to understand exacerbations so we can treat our patients with accuracy and improve their lives.

In this issue of Journal, Gao and colleagues (pp.) have published a thoughtful study that provides clarity where there has been only a chasm of unknowns. By harnessing the current scientific knowledge of bronchiectasis pathophysiology, they boldly go where no one has gone before: to map molecular endotypes of bronchiectasis exacerbations. The authors began their investigation with the hypothesis that patients with bronchiectasis experience distinct types of exacerbations: bacterial, viral, bacterial/viral coinfection, eosinophilic, and an unknown exacerbation type. Using prospectively obtained matched stable and exacerbated-state sputum samples from 120 patients with bronchiectasis, they employed culture methods and polymerase chain reaction techniques to organize patients into the a priori exacerbation types. Then, they assigned distinct microbiome and inflammatory profiles to each type of exacerbation. Finally, they performed an exploratory analysis of the proteomic landscape within a subgroup of the study cohort to identify specific proteins that, combined with the microbiome and inflammatory data, produce exacerbation endotypes.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: its diagnosis and management [^c936e237]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

An increase in the frequency of diagnosing non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children is due to heightened awareness of the disease and the wider availability of high-resolution computed tomography. The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent "wet/productive" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life. In this article, we review its pathogenesis and diagnosis and the evidence base for available treatments.

### Diagnosis and quantification of bronchiectasis using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging: a systematic review [^464ac880]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is an irreversible dilatation of the airways caused by inflammation and infection. To diagnose bronchiectasis in clinical care and to use bronchiectasis as outcome parameter in clinical trials, a radiological definition with exact cut-off values along with image analysis methods to assess its severity are needed. The aim of this study was to review diagnostic criteria and quantification methods for bronchiectasis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane and Google Scholar. English written, clinical studies that included bronchiectasis as outcome measure and used image quantification methods were selected. Criteria for bronchiectasis, quantification methods, patient demographics, and data on image acquisition were extracted.

Results

We screened 4182 abstracts, selected 972 full texts, and included 122 studies. The most often used criterion for bronchiectasis was an inner airway-artery ratio ≥ 1.0 (42%), however no validation studies for this cut-off value were found. Importantly, studies showed that airway-artery ratios are influenced by age. To quantify bronchiectasis, 42 different scoring methods were described.

Conclusion

Different diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis are being used, but no validation studies were found to support these criteria. To use bronchiectasis as outcome in future studies, validated and age-specific cut-off values are needed.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^b31859b8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a common feature of severe inherited and acquired pulmonary disease conditions. Among inherited diseases, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the major disorder associated with bronchiectasis, while acquired conditions frequently featuring bronchiectasis include post-infective bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mechanistically, bronchiectasis is driven by a complex interplay of inflammation and infection with neutrophilic inflammation playing a predominant role. The clinical characterization and management of bronchiectasis should involve a precise diagnostic workup, tailored therapeutic strategies and pulmonary imaging that has become an essential tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of bronchiectasis. Prospective future studies are required to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic management of bronchiectasis, particularly in heterogeneous non-CF bronchiectasis populations.

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^7fbe6f31]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common chronic inflammatory airway diseases. They have been estimated to affect more than 5–10% of the world population –. Although both asthma and COPD remain clearly underdiagnosed, it is very important to consider that they are not the only existing chronic inflammatory airway diseases that can be clinically suspected in Primary Care, and therefore a good differential diagnosis must be made with respect to other entities. It must be borne in mind that a diagnosis is not necessarily always going to be COPD (or only COPD) in a male smoker with airflow obstruction, or asthma (or only asthma) in a non-smoking female with airflow obstruction, even though these diagnoses are correct most of the time. It is always necessary to think that these same symptoms and signs can appear in other airway diseases, and if these are correctly diagnosed a patient's follow-up and treatment may have to be altered.

Bronchiectasis is the third most common chronic inflammatory airway disease, after COPD and asthma. Its prevalence is not known, but it is estimated to be around 350–500 cases/100,000 inhabitantsand it increases rapidly with age. Its symptoms can easily be confused with those of COPD and asthma. Bronchiectasis can be caused by dozens of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases (although in up to 30–50% of cases the cause is unknown), and, as in COPD and asthma, a variable number and severity of exacerbations can appear throughout its natural history, usually with an infectious profile. A global consensus of experts recently defined bronchiectasis as a clinical-radiological disease consisting of dilation of the bronchial lumen accompanied by compatible symptoms (usually chronic cough plus expectoration with a purulent component). This dilation of the bronchial lumen is produced by a vicious circle of inflammation and chronic infection that injures the bronchial wall, producing irreversible destruction. Bronchial inflammation and infection are therefore two key points in the management of these patients –, and, as in COPD and asthma, chronic airflow obstruction is their most frequent functional pattern. In severe cases, systemic inflammation, (predominantly neutrophilicbut sometimes with a significant eosinophilic profile) is present –. In this article, we will try to offer a series of important concepts (Box 1) and practical tips (Box 2) on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis in Primary Care. However, it is important to highlight that these recommendations could vary according to the geographical area and the resources available in each respective setting.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^34dab1fb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis prevalence in patients with COPD varies from 8% to 69%, being higher in those with more severe airflow obstruction. Patients with overlapping COPD and bronchiectasis have more exacerbations and symptoms, a higher risk of pneumonia, and increased mortality than patients with either diagnosis. This increased exacerbation risk may be because of more frequent isolation of pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The diagnosis of COPD is primarily physiological, whereas that of bronchiectasis is radiological. However, patients with severe and/or extensive bronchiectasis can have poorly-reversible airflow obstruction, meeting spirometric criteria for COPD. Diagnostic criteria for COPD/bronchiectasis overlap include appropriate ROSE (radiology, airflow obstruction, symptoms, and exposure). In these patients, it is impossible to differentiate exacerbation of the bronchiectasis from ECOPD. Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend searching for an alternative treatable underlying cause (such as antibody deficiency), and it is logical to use CT scans to exclude bronchiectasis in patients with frequent ECOPDs.

### Bronchiectasis evaluation 2025: pediatric and adult perspectives [^ce4b801b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a significant overlap between the diagnostic evaluation for adult and pediatric patients with bronchiectasis; however, also important age-specific unique considerations. This review focuses on these specific considerations.

Recent Findings

Bronchiectasis refers to the radiographic evidence of dilation of distal and proximal bronchi secondary to chronic infection and inflammation. Bronchiectasis can be suspected on plain chest radiograph but is confirmed and detailed through computed tomography (CT) imaging. Several different measures and descriptions of the radiographic findings of bronchiectasis exist, but the most common is a bronchial diameter equal to or greater than an adjacent blood vessel. Consideration for the presence of bronchiectasis begins with recognition of clinical symptoms of suppurative lung disease including persistent sputum producing cough and recurrent respiratory infections. Bronchiectasis etiologies include inherited forms, such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, as well as secondary forms including chronic aspiration as well as certain infections, and immunodeficiency. Up to 40% remain idiopathic even after a comprehensive evaluation.

Summary

It is important to start a bronchiectasis evaluation with a broad differential, but secondary testing should focus on etiologies specific to the patient. A thoughtful combination of testing is often required to arrive at an etiology. Patients with bronchiectasis require ongoing monitoring including longitudinal follow-up of respiratory cultures, lung function testing, and repeat CT imaging.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^0b9849f3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for Bronchiectasis in adults were published in January 2019, and comprise recommendations for treatment from primary to tertiary care. Here, we outline the practical implications of these guidelines for primary care practitioners. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be considered when a patient presents with a recurrent or persistent (> 8 weeks) productive cough. A definitive diagnosis is made by using thin-section chest computed tomography (CT). Once diagnosed, patients should be initially assessed by a specialist respiratory team and a shared management plan formulated with the patient, the specialist and primary care teams. The cornerstone of primary care management is physiotherapy to improve airway sputum clearance and maximise exercise capacity, with prompt treatment of acute exacerbations with antibiotics.

### Patient information: bronchiectasis… [^3c7f2f8f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Walter KL. What Is Bronchiectasis. JAMA. Published online August 07, 2025. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2025. 11485 Patients with bronchiectasis have permanently inflamed and dilated airways. Bronchiectasis may be caused by the genetic disease cystic fibrosis or can occur in patients without CF. Approximately 500 000 people in the US have non-CF bronchiectasis.

1. The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is daily cough lasting longer than 8 to 12 weeks with clear or colored phlegm. Patients with bronchiectasis may also have shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and fatigue, and less commonly, may cough up phlegm with blood. Non-CF bronchiectasis is more common in women and older people and in patients with acid reflux, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Other risk factors include a history of pneumonia, infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria or tuberculosis, certain genetic conditions, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and cigarette smoking. In up to 40% of cases, the cause of non-CF bronchiectasis is unknown. Bronchiectasis is diagnosed based on chest computed tomography findings of dilated airways. Chest CT may also reveal airway thickening and mucus in the airways. To evaluate the cause and severity of bronchiectasis, patients should have blood testing, sputum cultures, and pulmonary function testing with spirometry. Exacerbations of bronchiectasis are episodes of worsened disease that typically present with increased cough, dark colored sputum, and increased fatigue.

Exacerbations are associated with a decline in lung function and decreased quality of life and should be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Patients with bronchiectasis who have asthma or COPD should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to decrease airway inflammation and help open the airways. Individuals with 3 or more exacerbations of bronchiectasis per year may benefit from use of inhaled antibiotics or daily oral antibiotics.

### British thoracic society guideline for non-CF bronchiectasis [^d9fb2e59]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, investigation and particularly management of bronchiectasis has been largely empirical and the subject of relatively few controlled clinical trials. There are no clear guidelines, although an Australian position statement has been published concerning bronchiectasis in children. The purposes of these guidelines were therefore threefold: (1) to identify relevant studies in non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis; (2) to provide guidelines on management based on published studies where possible or a consensus view; and (3) to identify gaps in our knowledge and identify areas for future study.

### Bronchiectasis revisited: imaging-based pattern approach to diagnosis [^f17ca04a]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is one of the causes of non-resolving, persistent or recurrent pulmonary infection which, if uncorrected may have deleterious consequences on the lung parenchyma and pulmonary circulation. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is needed for the confirmation, localization and directing management accordingly.

Contents

Bronchiectasis is one of the major cause of morbidity worldwide. Chest radiograph is done at the initial suspicion which is supplemented by HRCT to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging diagnosis supplemented by the recognition of the pattern of involvement is essential to outline the differential diagnosis, map the complications and, hence, guiding the further management. Identification of the causative aetiology may not only prevent its further progression but obviate recurrent insults to the lung parenchyma as well. This article focuses on an algorithmic approach to bronchiectasis based on the distribution on imaging.

Bronchiectasis in COPD — With increasing use of computed tomography in the assessment of people with COPD, the presence of previously unrecognized bronchiectasis is being identified. The prevalence of bronchiectasis in COPD patients has been analyzed in several studies with conflicting results ranging from 20% to 69% (mean prevalence was 54.3%). Whether this diagnosis based on radiological criteria has the same impact as a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis remains unknown at present, and two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have compared the characteristics of COPD patients with and without bronchiectasis, reporting greater daily sputum production, more frequent exacerbations, poorer lung function, and higher level of inflammatory biomarkers.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults: a review [^ae86e554]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bronchiectasis:

- **Definition**: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition, which presents with permanent and abnormal dilation of the bronchi, and is characterized by mild to moderate airway obstruction and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of bronchiectasis include sequelae of previous bacterial infection or mycobacterial infection (e.g., following pneumonia, whooping cough, or tuberculosis), as well as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, toxic lung injury, primary ciliary dyskinesia, COPD, and α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Impairment of airway defense mechanisms due to inflammation and persistent infection results in bronchiectasis.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include productive cough, excessive sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, and recurrent chest infections. The disease can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients with acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is 9% and 30%, respectively.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following investigations and management in a deteriorating patient:

- obtain a comprehensive re-evaluation of patients and their treatment in cases of clinical deterioration, including increasing exacerbation frequency and/or severity, worsening of symptoms, and/or rapid decline in lung function

- evaluate adherence to both airway clearance techniques and/or pharmacological treatment

- review underlying diseases other than bronchiectasis to ensure they are being adequately treated

- consider obtaining investigation for specific conditions known to be associated with deterioration, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or infection with a new pathogen

- recognize that early diagnosis of bronchiectasis, accurate identification and treatment of its underlying cause, adequate management of chronic airway infection, and interventions to prevent exacerbations and control disease may delay disease progression

- obtain repeat chest CT imaging to identify several potential causes of deterioration

- obtain repeat testing for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection when there are suggestive clinical or radiologic features, particularly in patients who deteriorate despite appropriate antibiotics

- refer deteriorating patients who are not already under the care of a bronchiectasis specialist to a respiratory clinic with expertise in bronchiectasis

- review and optimize current treatment using a "treatable traits" approach. This includes, but is not limited to, treatment directed at the underlying etiology of the patient's bronchiectasis, airway clearance and mucoactive treatments, vaccination status, long-term (inhaled or oral) antibiotic treatment, P. aeruginosa eradication treatment, long-term inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and non-invasive ventilatory support where appropriate

- consider offering lung resection in highly selected patients with localized disease whose symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment optimized by a bronchiectasis specialist

- recognize that early referral for lung transplantation is essential in patients with progressive disease despite optimal medical management. This may include rapidly declining forced expiratory volume in one second or forced expiratory volume in one second ≤ 30% predicted, and/or arterial CO₂ pressure ≥ 50 mmHg. (conditional recommendation for the intervention, very low certainty of evidence).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain CXR in patients with suspected bronchiectasis to assess for associated conditions and exclude diseases causing similar symptoms. Obtain chest CT to evaluate the extent, severity, and distribution of bronchiectasis, as well as to assess associated parenchymal disease.
Consider obtaining CTA to assess for important vascular findings, such as dilated bronchial arteries and other systemic collateral vessels that can be sources of bleeding. Consider obtaining chest MRI to assess for the presence and extent of bronchiectasis, recognizing that it is inferior to CT in evaluation of the lung parenchyma and is not widely used for this indication.

### The association between bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: data from the European bronchiectasis registry (EMBARC) [^93fa0b9e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: COPD and bronchiectasis are commonly reported together. Studies report varying impacts of co-diagnosis on outcomes, which may be related to different definitions of disease used across studies. Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with bronchiectasis and its relationship with clinical outcomes. We further investigated the impact of implementing the standardized ROSE criteria (radiological bronchiectasis [R], obstruction [FEV₁/FVC ratio < 0.7; O], symptoms [S], and exposure [⩾10 pack-years of smoking; E]), an objective definition of the association of bronchiectasis with COPD. Methods: Analysis of the EMBARC (European Bronchiectasis Registry), a prospective observational study of patients with computed tomography-confirmed bronchiectasis from 28 countries. The ROSE criteria were used to objectively define the association of bronchiectasis with COPD. Key outcomes during a maximum of 5years of follow-up were exacerbations, hospitalization, and mortality. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 16,730 patients with bronchiectasis were included; 4,336 had a clinician-assigned codiagnosis of COPD, and these patients had more exacerbations, worse quality of life, and higher severity scores. We observed marked overdiagnosis of COPD: 22.2% of patients with a diagnosis of COPD did not have airflow obstruction and 31.9% did not have a history of ⩾10 pack-years of smoking. Therefore, 2,157 patients (55.4%) met the ROSE criteria for COPD. Compared with patients without COPD, patients who met the ROSE criteria had increased risks of exacerbations and exacerbations resulting in hospitalization during follow-up (incidence rate ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–1.35; vs. incidence rate ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.90, respectively). Conclusions: The label of COPD is often applied to patients with bronchiectasis who do not have objective evidence of airflow obstruction or a smoking history. Patients with a clinical label of COPD have worse clinical outcomes.

### Interventions for bronchiectasis: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^2df8fdd2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi, and presents typically with a chronic productive cough (or chronic wet cough in children) and recurrent infective exacerbations. It significantly impacts daily activities and quality of life, and can lead to recurrent hospitalisations, severe lung function impairment, respiratory failure and even death.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of interventions for adults and children with bronchiectasis from Cochrane reviews. To identify gaps in the evidence base that will inform recommendations for new research and reviews, and to summarise information on reported outcomes and make recommendations for the reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews.

Methods

We included Cochrane reviews of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 11 February 2015. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but not currently included in, published reviews to make recommendations for new Cochrane reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the AMSTAR criteria. We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials and guideline data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, lung function and quality of life.

Main Results

We included 21 reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, only nine reviews that reported results for people with bronchiectasis alone. Of the reviews with no usable data, two reviews included studies with mixed clinical populations where data were not reported separately for people with bronchiectasis and 10 reviews did not contain any trials. Of the 40 studies included across the nine reviews, three (number of participants nine to 34) included children. The studies ranged from single session to year-long studies. Each review included from one to 11 trials and 28 (70%) trials in the overview included 40 or fewer participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 1040. The age range of adult participants was from 36 to 73 years and children ranged from six to 16 years. The proportion of male participants ranged from 21% to 72%. Where reported, mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 1.17 L to 1.66 L and from 47% to 88% predicted. Most of the reviews had search dates older than two years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane reviews, but it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions. There was inconclusive evidence on the use of long-term antibiotics and nebulised hypertonic saline for reducing exacerbation frequency and evidence that human deoxyribonuclease (RhDNase) increases exacerbation frequency. Improvements in lung function were reported for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) though this was small and not clinically relevant. Evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents and mucolytics was inconclusive. There was limited evidence of improvements in quality of life with airway clearance techniques and physical therapy but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Secondary outcomes were not clearly reported in all trials in the included reviews. Improvements in dyspnoea, wheeze and cough-free days were reported for small trials of ICS and LABA (long-acting beta2-agonsts)/ICS and cough reduction was also reported for a small bromhexine trial. Reduction in sputum production was reported for long-term antibiotics and airway clearance techniques but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Adverse events were included as outcomes in seven reviews. The review of long-term (four weeks to one year) prophylactic courses of antibiotics reported significantly more cases of wheeze (Peto odd ratio (OR) 8.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.63 to 44.93), dyspnoea (12 versus three, P value = 0.01) and chest pain (seven versus zero, P value = 0.01) from the same trial (74 participants) but no differences in occurrence of diarrhoea, rash or number of withdrawals. In the review of mucolytics versus placebo, relevant outcomes were not reported for erdosteine comparisons and no significant adverse effects were reported for bromhexine, though adverse events were associated with RhDNase (OR 28.19, 95% CI 3.77 to 210.85, 1 study). Of the remaining five reviews, adverse events were not reported in the single trials included in the ICS review or the physical therapy review and the impact of adverse events in the single trial included in the inhaled LABA/ICS combination versus ICS review were unclear. The reviews of short-term courses of antibiotics and inhaled hyperosmolar agents reported no significant differences in occurrence of adverse events. Fewer admissions to hospital were reported for long-term antibiotics, but this outcome was not reported in all reviews. No reviews reported differences in mortality, but again this outcome was not included in all reviews. We did not explicitly include antibiotic resistance as an outcome in the review, but this was unclear in the Cochrane reviews and evidence from other trials should be considered. We rated all reviews as high quality (AMSTAR), though opportunities for improved reporting (e.g. summary of findings and GRADE evaluation of the evidence) were identified for inclusion in future updates of the reviews. However, the majority of trials were not high quality and confidence in the effects of treatments, therefore, requires additional evidence from larger and more methodologically robust trials. We evaluated the overall coverage of important topics in bronchiectasis by mapping the quality of the current evidence base against published guidelines and identifying high priority areas for new research on; use of short-course and long-term antibiotics, ICS and oral corticosteroids, inhaled hyperosmolars, mucolytics, and use of airway clearance techniques.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview clearly points to significant opportunities for further research aimed at improving outcomes for people with bronchiectasis. We have highlighted important endpoints for studies (particularly exacerbations, quality of life and lung function), and areas of clinical practice that are in most urgent need of evidence-based support (including long-term antibiotics, ICSs and mucolytics). As the evidence is confined to small trials of short duration, it is not currently possible to assess the balance between the benefits and potential harms of treatments for bronchiectasis.

### Diagnostic challenges of bronchiectasis [^51551c21]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a condition of increasing incidence and prevalence around the world. Many different diseases have been associated with bronchiectasis, and their treatment can differ widely. Recent guidelines have helped to approach aetiological diagnosis but it is still a complex process. Identifying the cause of the bronchiectasis may determine a change in the treatment of a large group of subjects. That is one of the main reasons why the aetiological diagnosis is crucial in the proper management of bronchiectasis patients. Postinfectious bronchiectasis is the most frequent entity among different studies, but a high percentage of cases still remain without a clear aetiology. Bronchiectasis related to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), immunodeficiencies with antibody production deficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, among others, require a specific management that may improve quality of life and prognosis in a large group of individuals. Therefore, the aim of this article is to review the main bronchiectasis related diseases and to simplify the aetiological diagnosis, in order to improve the management of bronchiectasis patients, especially in those where a specific treatment is available.

Background

This guideline refers to the investigation and management of patients with symptoms of persistent or recurrent bronchial sepsis related to irreversibly damaged and dilated bronchi, namely clinical bronchiectasis. It does not cover the management of cystic fibrosis (CF), and for the purposes of the guideline, 'bronchiectasis' is synonymous with the term 'non-CF bronchiectasis'. Likewise, it does not focus on traction bronchiectasis secondary to other lung pathologies, particularly the interstitial lung diseases, as the bronchiectasis is commonly asymptomatic.

For guidance on treatment for patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and bronchiectasis, please refer to the BTS Guideline on the management of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^442772e7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

In whom should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be suspected?

Recommendations

Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with persistent production of mucopurulent or purulent sputum particularly with relevant associated risk factors (D).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if they have symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections (C).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations (two or more annually) and a previous positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa while stable (B).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic productive cough (C).

Good practice points

In at-risk groups, if bronchiectasis is suspected, bronchiectasis needs confirmation.
In patients with COPD, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate especially in the presence of chronic productive cough with positive sputum cultures for potential pathogenic micro-organism (PPM) while stable or two or more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.
In patients with asthma, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with severe or poorly controlled disease.
In patients with a history of HIV-1 infection, solid organ and bone marrow transplant, and history of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma and vasculitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with other connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate if they have symptoms such as chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
Investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate in otherwise healthy individuals with a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks, especially with sputum production or a history of an appropriate trigger (see BTS Recommendations for the management of cough in adults).

### How does Pseudomonas aeruginosa affect the progression of bronchiectasis? [^4cf9eca1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens isolated from respiratory tract specimen in patients with bronchiectasis. It is considered highly responsible for pathogenicity, progression and clinical outcomes of bronchiectasis.

Aims

To summarize existing evidence on how different factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa affect the pathogenicity, progression and clinical outcomes of bronchiectasis, so as to provide possible insights for clinical practice and related research in the future.

Sources

PubMed was searched for studies pertaining to bronchiectasis and P. aeruginosa published to date, with no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria. Reference lists of retrieved reviews were searched for additional articles.

Content

This review focused on non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and also provided some data on cystic fibrosis when studies in bronchiectasis were limited. We discussed various factors in relation to P. aeruginosa: virulence factors, drug resistance, regulatory systems, genomic diversity and transmission of P. aeruginosa, as well as treatment for P. aeruginosa. Their impacts on bronchiectasis and its management were discussed.

Implications

The impact of P. aeruginosa on bronchiectasis is definite, although conclusions in some aspects are still vague. Faced with the worrying drug-resistance status and treatment bottleneck, individualized management and novel therapies beyond the classic pathway are most likely to be a future trend. To confirm the independent or integrated impact of various factors of P. aeruginosa on bronchiectasis and to figure out all the problems mentioned, larger randomized control trials are truly needed in the future.

### Prevalence and incidence of bronchiectasis in Italy [^4d823b88]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study definitions

The prevalence of bronchiectasis was estimated by calculating the proportion of patients with a bronchiectasis diagnosis from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2015 to the adult population (per 100,000) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The annual incidence rate from 2002 to 2015 was estimated by dividing new cases of bronchiectasis to person-years with 95% CI according to annual registration. A new case of bronchiectasis was a patient with a new ICD diagnosis of bronchiectasis without any similar diagnoses the years before. Both prevalence and incidence estimates were stratified by both gender and age classes each single year of analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate incidence and prevalence estimates in patients with a diagnosis of neither COPD nor asthma.

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^032d876f]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize an exacerbation as a worsening of symptoms that exceeds day-to-day variability and necessitates a change in management. Core symptoms include changes in cough, sputum volume and/or consistency, sputum purulence, dyspnea and/or exercise intolerance, fatigue or malaise, and hemoptysis. Additional clinical features may include fever, wheezing, general discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and changes on chest examination. Recognize features of a severe exacerbation, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotic treatment, which may include tachypnea, acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure, a significant decline in oxygen saturation or respiratory function, hypercapnia, hemoptysis, new onset of cyanosis, new signs of cor pulmonale, hemodynamic instability, and/or impaired cognitive function.

### Bronchiectasis: mechanisms and imaging clues of associated common and uncommon diseases [^40009eae]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is permanent irreversible dilatation of the airways and occurs in a variety of pathologic processes. Recurrent infection and inflammation and the resulting chemical and cellular cascade lead to permanent architectural changes in the airways. Bronchiectasis can confer substantial potential morbidity, usually secondary to recurrent infection. In severe cases of bronchiectasis, massive hemoptysis can lead to death. Thin-section computed tomography is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of bronchiectasis; findings include bronchial diameter exceeding that of the adjacent pulmonary artery and lack of normal tapering of terminal bronchioles as they course toward the lung periphery. The authors will review various causes of bronchiectasis, including common causes, such as recurrent infection or aspiration, and uncommon causes, such as congenital immunodeficiencies and disorders of cartilage development. The authors will also present an approach emphasizing the distribution (apical versus basal and central versus peripheral) and concomitant findings, such as nodules, cavities, and/or lymphadenopathy, that can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Although an adequate understanding of these underlying causes in conjunction with their specific imaging appearances will allow radiologists to more confidently determine the process causing this common radiologic finding, clinical history and patient demographic characteristics play an integral role in determining a pertinent and concise differential diagnosis.

### Bronchiectasis [^91d268c0]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a structural derangement of the bronchial wall that is characterized by airway dilatation and bronchial wall thickening. As a result of this abnormality, chronic inflammation and secondary microbial infections occur, which cause additional damage to the bronchi. Recent insights into the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of bronchiectasis, as well as improvements in computed tomography and the development of new pharmacological agents, might help to improve the clinical management of this chronic infective/inflammatory disorder.

### Bronchiectasis-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap: a ROSE by any other name? [^254e2c14]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the authors' findings should facilitate additional studies to identify phenotypes and specific risk factors. In addition to similarities in symptoms and clinical presentation, there are several potential mechanisms that could underlie the coexistence of BE and COPD. Emerging evidence supports the potential roles of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) dysfunction, chronic bacterial inflammation, adaptive immune deficiencies, and insults occurring during early lung development in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD, in addition to their established roles in BE. Further studies of patients with BE–COPD in these areas will lead to greater understanding of the nature of this overlap condition.

The ultimate aim, however, must be the characterization of traits or phenotypes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. The implementation of a standardized definition of BE–COPD could facilitate efforts to identify biomarkers that predict treatment response. A recent example that followed this translational arc can be found in the shift in emphasis from recognizing and defining asthma–COPD overlap as a unique syndrome to the discovery that type 2, or eosinophilic inflammation predicts treatment response to inhaled corticosteroids and biologic agents such as dupilumab. Studies in BE–COPD should similarly be directed toward diagnostic and treatment approaches to mitigate the high morbidity and mortality in BE–COPD that are highlighted by this study.

### British thoracic society quality standard for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults 2022 [^6af82336]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

The quality measures are not intended to be new sets of targets or mandatory indicators for performance management that need to be collected. The quality measures are specified in the form of a numerator and a denominator, which define a proportion or ratio (numerator/denominator). It is assumed that the numerator is a subset of the denominator population. The suggested numerator and denominator are provided to allow healthcare professionals and service providers to examine their clinical performance in relation to each quality standard. It is recognised that no national quality indicators will be available for this condition, and institutions will need to agree locally what information is required for the denominator to be used in each case, and what the expected level of achievement should be, given local circumstances. A brief description about the quality standard in relation to each audience is given.

The BTS Guideline for Bronchiectasis in Adults 2019is the main reference for all six quality statements. There is no specific order of priority associated with the list of quality statements.

### Management of bronchiectasis [^00d7ee79]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Around 1 in 1,000 adults in the UK has bronchiectasis, a potential outcome of various underlying lung diseases. It results from a 'vicious circle' of recurrent infection, inflammation, excessive mucus production, reduced mucociliary clearance, and dilatation and destruction of bronchi. Associated damage to blood vessels can lead to haemoptysis, which is usually slight, but may be severe. Bronchiectasis may be limited to one area (localised) or be more widespread (generalised). It can reduce lung function and quality of life, and may lead to respiratory failure and premature death. Here we review the management of patients with bronchiectasis.

### Bronchiectasis [^76b48022]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Results

We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^c22cc18b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging characteristics of bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is defined as irreversible dilation of bronchi in cylindrical, varicose, or a more cystic morphological appearance. In CF, it is often associated with mucus plugging, bronchial wall thickening, and small airway disease. The radiological evaluation of bronchiectasis is based on definition published in the terms for thoracic imaging of the Fleischner Society: " Morphologic criteria on thin-section CT scans include bronchial dilatation with respect to the accompanying pulmonary artery (signet ring sign), lack of tapering of bronchi, and identification of bronchi within 1 cm of the pleural surface". The so-called signet ring sign is the primary sign for bronchiectasis representing a ring-shaped opacity, whereas the smaller adjacent artery stays for the signet. According to this concept, the extent of bronchial dilation can be quantified using the ratio between bronchi and vessels, an approach challenged by a recent pediatric study. On HRCT, the bronchial tree is only visible up to the 6-8th generation. CT findings like the tree-in-bud sign and centrilobular opacity are linked to small airway disease with dilation and inflammation of the ronchiole or mucus plugging in its periphery (Fig. 2). There are differences in CF bronchiectasis depending on pancreas insufficiency (PI), with PI patients illustrating more severe bronchiectasis. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients have similar CT scores as pancreatic-sufficient (PS) CF patients, but in contrast to CF, no correlation between structural change and clinical parameters has been detected in a previous study. However, recent studies in adult PCD patient cohorts indicate that CT findings relate to lung function changes. There are no clear identifiers of pre-bronchiectasis in imaging. However, mucus plugging has been shown to be a common precursor in CF.

### Bronchiectasis-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap: a ROSE by any other name? [^2a163f8a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When interpreting the authors' findings, it is important to consider the ROSE definition of BE–COPD in the context of the inclusion criteria for the European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration registry. All participants in the cohort had radiographic BE and respiratory symptoms, so the distinction between BE and BE–COPD was made on the basis of spirometry (ROSE uses a fixed FEV₁:FVC ratio of < 0.7 to define obstruction) and smoking history (> 10 pack-years). As 35.1% of the BE-only (i.e. non-COPD) cohort were current or former smokers, COPD was defined on the basis of spirometric obstruction alone in a substantial proportion of patients with BE–COPD. This raises a key question as to whether the observed associations between BE–COPD and increased mortality and exacerbations reflect the presence of airflow obstruction in patients with more advanced BE who are thus at higher risk for poor outcomes or if BE–COPD represents a distinct endotype with unique pathophysiology. COPD diagnosis was associated with higher bronchiectasis severity index, but this relationship is difficult to disentangle, as most BE severity index criteria are also associated with increasingly severe COPD (age, body mass index, FEV₁, exacerbations/hospitalization, severity of dyspnea, colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria), in addition to radiographic severity of BE. Interestingly, rates of under- and overdiagnosis of BE–COPD when comparing the objective ROSE definition with clinician diagnosis varied by country. Geographic differences in healthcare access or environmental exposures other than cigarette smoke (e.g. biomass fuels, air pollution, passive tobacco smoke exposure) could account for some of these discrepancies and may be important considerations for further studies of BE–COPD. The observation of increased exacerbations and mortality for both clinician-assigned and objectively defined BE–COPD suggests that despite the observed discrepancies between these approaches, clinicians are already quite good at identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. However, we agree with the authors that the ROSE definition is more appropriate for future clinical studies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tracheobronchial disease [^8864ce57]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain chest CT for the assessment of complications of bronchiectasis and to detect changes in extent or severity of bronchiectasis and associated parenchymal disease. Obtain CXR as a first step in assessing thoracic diseases that can complicate bronchiectasis, such as infection, or in excluding other diseases that can cause worsening symptoms.
Consider obtaining contrast-enhanced chest CT in patients with suspected acute infection and associated complications. Consider obtaining CTA in cases of suspected bleeding as a cause of hemoptysis.

### The etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood: a systematic review of 989 subjects [^fb03a58a]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Synthesis of results

The categorical and specific etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis were pooled to provide estimates of the relative prevalence for each disorder. Total sample size estimates for categorical comparisons were calculated from the total number of etiologies identified for the entire review. Total sample size estimates for the comparison of specific etiologies within individual categories were calculated from the total number of etiologies reported in a given category.

Sources of bias across studies

Patient sampling by number, locale and institution raised the concern of population homogeneity and possible over- or under-representation of a specific area or ethnic group. Variability in diagnostic evaluation and the identification of multiple etiologies for individual patients were also potential sources of bias in defining etiology. Inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature were a potential source of error when studies were combined.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^be24b9b6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a condition in which an area of the bronchial lumen is permanently and abnormally widened, with accompanying infection. Bronchiectasis is found in a variety of pulmonary diseases, both genetically caused and acquired, such as severe pulmonary infections and cystic fibrosis (CF), but is also a feature of Kartagener syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, or primary immunodeficiencies. Bronchietasis is caused by long-term excessive inflammatory damage to the airways, which results in tissue breakdown, enlargement of the affected airways and the key clinical symptoms of chronic productive cough and shortness of breath. Globally, in up to half of all cases the cause cannot be identified (idiopathic). Those cases together with several other known aetiologies such as post-infectious and allergic hypersensitivity collectively fall under the category 'non-cystic fibrosis' (non-CF) bronchiectasis. Here we discuss the key features of both CF and non-CF related bronchiectasis with respect to their pathogenesis, imaging and clinical management.

Bronchiectasis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is addressed as follows: Bronchiectasis should be treated according to usual guidelines, and regarding COPD treatment, some patients may need more aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy, while inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may not be indicated in patients with bacterial colonization or recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.

### Resolution of extensive severe bronchiectasis in an infant [^6cd78e75]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2010). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is, by definition, an irreversible condition. Following recent reports of reversible bronchiectasis in children, it has been suggested that the definition be broadened to include pre-bronchiectasis and transitional reversible states. We describe the case of a young infant who had extensive, severe bronchiectasis of unknown etiology that resolved following prolonged treatment with antibiotics and a tapering course of oral steroids. We suggest that the prolonged treatment may have played a role, perhaps by eradicating infection and thus enabling regeneration of bronchial anatomy.

### CT of airways disease and bronchiectasis [^e8297689]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT is accepted as an accurate noninvasive means of diagnosing bronchiectasis. A wide spectrum of abnormalities may be identified at HRCT in patients with airway disease, including various distinctive patterns of bronchiectasis in specific clinical settings, such as ABPA, MAC infection, AIDS, and CF. Characteristic CT findings occasionally suggest a specific diagnosis that may not have been under clinical consideration. HRCT also provides significant clinical use in assessing the degree and extent of airway disease, and allows noninvasive monitoring of disease progression, regression, or response to therapy.

### Bronchiectasis: an emerging global epidemic [^7249029c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical disease

In this special issue, the clinical aspects of bronchiectasis are covered from both the physician and patient perspective. The authoritative review by Schäfer and colleagues reviews bronchiectasis pathogenesis, its imaging and clinical characteristics from both a cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF perspective across a diverse range of aetiologies. In a patient focused article, Hester et al. address the issue of adherence to the multi-modal treatment options used in the care of bronchiectasis patients by reviewing the provision of and requirement for patient education. Minimal work to date has been performed in bronchiectasis focused in this area especially when compared to other chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The information deficits uncovered in this qualitative approach clearly represent one of the key barriers to the implementation of bronchiectasis self-management. Further original qualitative work is provided by Dudgeon et al. whose study focused on the patient's perspective of health-related quality of life (QOL). Semi-structured interviews elucidated that bronchiectasis-related symptoms are highly individual and variable, a feature that current available treatment and QOL tools do not adequately capture.

### The clinical impacts of lung microbiome in bronchiectasis with fixed airflow obstruction: a prospective cohort study [^d5d5700a]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis, a heterogeneous disease in both etiology and clinical presentation, results from genetic or acquired conditions and is characterized by permanent airway dilatation and wall thickening. It exhibits diverse radiological and inflammatory patterns, microbiology, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by persistent airflow obstruction and increased airway inflammatory responses due to prolonged exposure to noxious particles or gases. Patients with bronchiectasis and fixed airflow obstruction (FAO) are those who meet both the obstructive spirometry criteria for COPD and the structural diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The clinical and pathological features coexisting in bronchiectasis and COPD can exacerbate symptoms, intensify inflammation, and worsen prognosis compared to either condition alone. A new consensus regarding the definition of "COPD–bronchiectasis association" was proposed by the EMBARC Airway Working Group recently; this definition comprises four components, namely specific r adiological signs, functional obstructive pattern, at least two characteristic respiratory symptoms, and current or past smoking (≥ 10 pack-years) or biomass e xposure (i.e. ROSE criteria), which are used to describe the coexistence of these two disease entities with complex interactions.

### Severe bronchiectasis [^27a4b863]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is primarily the result of airway injury and remodeling attributable to recurrent or chronic inflammation and infection. The underlying etiologies include autoimmune diseases, severe infections, genetic abnormalities, and acquired disorders. Recurrent airway inflammation and infection may also be the result of allergic or immunodeficiency states such as allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses or HIV/AIDS. Bronchiectasis should be included in the differentiation diagnosis of any patient with chronic respiratory complaints such as cough and sputum production. Early clinical manifestations may be subtle. Hallmarks of severe bronchiectasis include fetid breath, chronic cough, and sputum production. The associated chronic respiratory infections and airway sepsis are punctuated by episodes of acute exacerbation. Prompt recognition and treatment of bronchiectasis may allow for prevention of disease progression and irreversible loss of lung function. This review of severe non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis describes the current pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and management of bronchiectasis. We review how impaired airway clearance and the inability to resolve infection and inflammation creates a vicious cycle of recurrent injury. The common clinical features of bronchiectasis and findings are presented and illustrated by radiographic images. The common species and significance of various organisms often recovered from the distal airways including: tuberculous and environmental mycobacteria, aspergillus, and bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be covered. Management strategies including sputum surveillance, sputum clearance, antimicrobial therapy including antifungal and antimyobacterial agents as well as the evidence for the use of inhalational and anti-inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids are also discussed. Recommendations for the work-up and therapy of complications including hemoptysis and respiratory failure are presented.

### The development of bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography in children with cystic fibrosis: can pre-stages be identified? [^98fb9d24]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

CT analysis

According to the definition of the validated CF-CT scoring system, bronchiectasis is present if the bronchial lumen diameter is larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery outer diameter, or if there is a lack of tapering for at least 2 cm distal to a branching point. Based on literature about the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis and based on the expertise of a panel consisting of a paediatric pulmonologist (HT), a radiologist (PC), a biomedical imaging expert (MB) and a PhD student (LT), five mutually exclusive categories for classifying pre-stages of bronchiectasis were defined. These categories were: (1) bronchiectasis (bronchial lumen diameter is larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery outer diameter, or lack of tapering for at least 2 cm, Fig. 1), (2) mucus plugging (filling of clearly identifiable bronchi, Fig. 1), (3) airway wall thickening (ratio between the bronchial wall thickness and the outer diameter of the adjacent pulmonary artery being more than 33%, Fig. 1), (4) atelectasis or consolidation and (5) normal airways. These categories are well defined as part of the CF-CT scoring system and are further explained in the on-line supplementary material.

Fig. 1
Illustration of scoring categories: bronchiectasis (left), mucus plugging (middle) and airway wall thickening (right)

CTs were de-identified and randomized. One observer (observer 2: DZ) encircled all areas with bronchiectasis (bronchial lumen diameter-pulmonary artery outer diameter ratio > 2 or saccular bronchiectasis) in the most recent volumetric inspiratory CT (CT baseline). Those areas were marked as a region of interest (ROI) using tools in our image analysis platform (®Myrian Onco XL, Intrasense, France). By using deformable image registration, the same areas were automatically identified in the previous CTs (CT minus2-minus8). All preceding ROIs were assessed by two experienced observers with respectively 1 and 2 years of experience (HO and DZ) and assigned to one of the five above-mentioned categories. Category 2–5 reflects a potential pre-stage in the ROI of the bronchiectatic airway observed on the most recent CT.

ROIs were assessed in random order with respect to patients and order of CT scans (CT minus2-minus8). Therefore, the observers had no knowledge of the assigned category of the ROIs in previous or later scans.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^1bc524a5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging of bronchiectasis in CF lung disease

Detection and characterization of bronchiectasis are the domain of thin-section computed tomography (CT). High-resolution CT (HRCT) with 0.6 to 1.5 mm slice thickness serves as a reference standard for imaging. However, pulmonary MRI has gained interest due to the possibility of functional imaging without radiation burden. Moreover, new technical developments overcome the limitations of low MR-signal and low spatial resolution. In CF, standardized reporting using scores or automated quantification are essential requisites to measure and track findings, particularly when results focus on risk stratification. In this context, bronchiectasis is one of the important imaging markers and generally correlates with clinical outcome.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^63c34cb1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Based on this concept, it is believed that, if left untreated, a fraction of PBBs will progress to chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) with radiologically confirmed bronchiectasis (Fig. 1). CSLD differs from bronchiectasis only by lacking the radiographic signs of bronchiectasis on HRCT scans. Clinically, CSLD is diagnosed in children whose chronic wet cough does not resolve with oral antibiotics and in whom other causes are excluded. Although not proven formally for all causes of bronchiectasis, the sequence of progression from PBB over CSLD to bronchiectasis is highly likely, but needs to be substantiated with prospective studies. Of interest is the recent finding that otherwise healthy children with PBB, children with bronchiectasis, and children with CF shared similar core airway microbiota patterns, with H. influenzae making the greatest contribution to the observed similarity, while the microbiota in adults with CF and bronchiectasis were significantly different. The authors concluded that chronic airway infections starts similarly with defective airway clearance, but over time with intervention and host factors, i.e. the underlying cause, progressively diverge.

### British thoracic society quality standard for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults 2022 [^955a2f3c]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has been at the forefront of the production of guidelines for best clinical practice in respiratory medicine, since the society was established 40 years ago. The society was awarded National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) accreditation for its guideline production process in November 2011 and the society's Guideline Production Manual setting out the detailed methodology and policy to produce guidelines is reviewed annually by the BTS Standards of Care Committee (SOCC).

A statement on quality standards based on each BTS guideline is a key part of the range of supporting materials that the society produces to assist in the dissemination and implementation of a guideline's recommendations.

A quality standard is a set of specific, concise statements that:

Act as markers of high-quality, cost-effective patient care across a pathway or clinical area, covering treatment or prevention.
Are derived from the best available evidence.

NICE Quality Standards and the 2021 NICE Quality Standards Process Guidewere used as a model for the development of BTS Quality Standards.

This document contains Quality Standards to be used in primary and secondary care for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults (patients with the clinical syndrome of regular cough and sputum production, with or without recurrent chest infections and radiological confirmation of bronchiectasis). This document supersedes the BTS Quality Standards for Clinically Significant Bronchiectasis in Adults, published in 2012.

The rationale for these quality standards is drawn from evidence and recommendations summarised in the BTS Guideline for Bronchiectasis in Adults 2019. A link to that document can be found below:

This document aims to improve the standards of care for people with bronchiectasis. The purpose of the document is to provide commissioners, planners and patients with a guide to the minimum standards of care that patients with this particular disease should expect, together with measurable markers of good practice.

BTS Quality Standards are intended for:

Healthcare professionals to allow decisions to be made about care based on the latest evidence and best practice.
Patients with bronchiectasis and their carers to enable understanding of what services they should expect from their health and social care provider.
Service providers to be able to quickly and easily examine the clinical performance of their organisation and assess the standards of care they provide.
Commissioners so that they can be confident that the services they are purchasing are high quality and cost-effective.

### Bronchiectasis, chronic suppurative lung disease and protracted bacterial bronchitis [^47f3e54c]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a structural airway disease characterized by dilated bronchi and bronchioles due to severe or recurrent lower airways inflammation. Bronchiectasis can occur as a result of chronic pulmonary aspiration. Bronchiectasis may also be associated with a wide variety of systemic diseases, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Children with bronchiectasis typically have a chronic or recurrent productive cough and carry a significant burden of disease with a considerable impact on quality of life. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made by high-resolution chest computerized tomography. Aggressive management of bronchiectasis is necessary to reduce the daily symptom burden and frequency of exacerbations. Chronic suppurative lung disease may be a precursor to bronchiectasis, only lacking the defining radiographic features of bronchiectasis. Children with chronic suppurative lung disease may have the same symptoms as children with bronchiectasis and should be treated similarly. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as a cough lasting at least four weeks that responds to antibiotic therapy. Protracted bacterial bronchitis may occur following a viral respiratory tract infection. Protracted bacterial bronchitis can be treated with a prolonged course of empiric antibiotics. Further evaluation is necessary if a child with suspected protracted bacterial bronchitis does not adequately respond to antibiotics as chronic suppurative lung disease or bronchiectasis must be considered.

### Functional inspiratory training in bronchiectasis… [^873c301e]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional Inspiratory Training in BronchiectasisClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease clinically characterized by recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, chronic cough, and sputum production, and is associated with an increase in the airway-artery ratio and permanent airway dilatation. It is recognized as the third most common chronic respiratory disease after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. In the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, it has its own diagnostic code. In bronchiectasis, mucociliary clearance is impaired due to bronchial dilatation, and the insufficient clearance of bacteria and mucus from the respiratory tract leads to persistent infection, inflammation, and further airway damage. Progressive airway damage results in impaired lung function, worsening of symptoms, and, ultimately, respiratory failure and death.

It can represent the final pathway of various infectious, allergic, inflammatory, genetic, and degenerative disorders, making it one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes. Some patients present with daily symptoms, while others remain asymptomatic except during exacerbations. The most common symptom is chronic cough caused by purulent or mucopurulent sputum. Other symptoms include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, wheezing, fatigue, and weight loss. Fever, however, is not a common finding and differs from pneumonia. The most frequently used classification system categorizes bronchiectasis into varicose, cylindrical, and saccular types. In the most severe form, the saccular type, the bronchi lose their structural integrity completely, forming cystic structures filled with secretions. The mildest form is cylindrical, in which the bronchi have thick, straight walls. In the varicose type, localized narrowings are observed.

Diagnosis is made following history and physical examination, with high-resolution computed tomography being the most sensitive and specific method, along with sputum culture and chest radiography. The goals of bronchiectasis treatment are to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. Both pharmacological and patient-managed interventions are commonly applied. Pharmacological treatments include antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids, which are generally administered via inhalation. Patient-managed interventions require active participation and behavioral modification.

### Cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia share extensive similarities: is It time to place them under a common umbrella? [^d2e4ab6f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic suppurative lung condition with high epidemiological, etiological, and clinical heterogeneity. As the common end‐stage sequela of a wide spectrum of underlying diseases, bronchiectasis is derived from the pathogenetic vicious vortex of airway structural damage, mucociliary clearance impairment, chronic respiratory infection, and immune dysregulation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which results from decreased production, altered stability, and/or impaired function of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) due to mutations in the CFTR gene. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an underrecognized rare genetic disease, usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which derives from the structural and functional impairment of motile cilia due to pathogenetic mutations in more than 60 genes. Both conditions impair different hydrodynamic components of mucociliary clearance, predispose to recurrent respiratory infections, and often lead to the development of bronchiectasis.

Non‐CF bronchiectasis has historically emerged as a practical inclusive term to differentiate CF from diverse other diseases that result to bronchiectasis, as the former is caused by a well‐described pathogenetic mechanism, has distinct epidemiological and clinical features, and requires specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Even though PCD shares more similarities than differences with CF, as opposed to other causes of bronchiectasis, it is usually included in the definition of non‐CF bronchiectasis and is collectively considered with other bronchiectatic conditions in the literature. Only rarely, the term "non‐CF, non‐PCD bronchiectasis" is used, mostly by authors with a clinical and research interest in PCD.

In this article, we highlight the similarities of CF and PCD, which differentiate them from all other causes of bronchiectasis, as they both inherently affect the mucociliary escalator in different aspects. We further suggest their consideration under the same umbrella as primary mucociliary diseases and their collective separation from bronchiectasis attributed to other causes.

### Bronchiectasis: which antibiotics to use and when? [^719f8dcb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In 2010, the British Thoracic Society published a guideline for the care of patients with noncystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis; other recent clinical review articles and original scientific manuscripts have also studied the use of antibiotics in bronchiectasis. This review will summarize the current literature on the indications and options for antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis.

Recent Findings

Since 2012, a number of manuscripts have been published that provide evidence to support the use of antibiotics in non-CF bronchiectasis, including macrolide antibiotics, inhaled aminoglycosides and inhaled fluoroquinolone therapies. However, data remain preliminary and there are phase 3 trials underway to further investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotics in non-CF bronchiectasis.

Summary

Although there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibiotics for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, this review will highlight the current state of the science with regard to antibiotics that may be effective in non-CF bronchiectasis as well as highlighting those in development to treat this complex disease.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following interventions during exacerbations:

- prescribe antibiotics for an exacerbation, guided by previous microbiology results, local susceptibility patterns, and clinical severity

- include guidance on recognizing exacerbations in an adult bronchiectasis self-management plan. Consider providing selected patients the ability to self-administer antibiotics at home with appropriate instruction and education to allow more prompt treatment

- review patients not responding promptly to oral antibiotics or showing signs of a severe exacerbation to determine if there is a need for a change in treatment, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and/or hospitalization

- adapt airway clearance regimens in frequency, intensity, and technique during an exacerbation

- recognize that a 14-day antibiotic course is considered standard, especially in severe exacerbations or in patients with P. aeruginosa infection. Consider shorter courses in patients with mild bronchiectasis, those with infection due to pathogens more sensitive to antibiotics (such as S. pneumoniae), or patients with a rapid return to baseline symptoms during treatment.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to initial investigations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain standardized testing in patients with bronchiectasis to identify the underlying cause, evaluate disease severity and activity, assess the risk of poor outcomes, and identify co-morbidities and associated treatable traits.

- screen all patients newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis for immunodeficiency by measuring serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis by measuring total IgE, aspergillus-specific IgG and E, as well as blood eosinophils, and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection by mycobacterial microscopy and culture

- obtain a minimum of three sputum samples or a bronchoalveolar lavage in patients at high risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection based on clinical and radiological features

- do not obtain routine α-1 antitrypsin testing, but consider performing it in patients with suggestive clinical and radiological features such as basal emphysema or severe airflow obstruction

- screen patients with symptom onset during childhood or with specific clinical or radiological features (independent of age of onset) for cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia

- calculate a bronchiectasis severity index in newly diagnosed patients with bronchiectasis to assess the risk of future complications

- identify patients at higher risk of future complications. Consider more frequent follow-up and a lower threshold for treatment in high-risk groups. Recognize that high risk groups include: patients with COPD, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or rheumatoid arthritis-associated bronchiectasis; patients with P. aeruginosa or other enteric Gram-negative infections; patients with two or more exacerbations per year or one severe exacerbation (defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics) in the previous year; patients with severe symptoms including high volumes of daily sputum production and sputum purulence; patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection; patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

- include assessment of co-morbid illnesses in the evaluation of all patients with bronchiectasis: Investigate patients at risk for associated CVD and osteoporosis; Screen patients for symptoms of anxiety and depression and initiate appropriate management; Identify and manage rhinosinusitis and GERD as common co-morbidities of bronchiectasis; Consider treatment burden and the impact on associated conditions as part of treatment decisions when managing bronchiectasis; Consider the assessments described, including the underlying cause, co-morbidities, disease activity, and treatable traits, at all patient visits and not just at diagnosis.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [^157fd812]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There is renewed interest in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, which is a cause of significant morbidity in adults and can be diagnosed by high-resolution chest computed tomography scan. No longer mainly a complication after pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, diverse disease processes and mechanisms have been demonstrated to result in the chronic cough, purulent sputum production, and airway dilation that characterize this disease. Improved understanding of the role of mucus stasis in causing bacterial colonization has led to increased emphasis on the use of therapies that enhance airway clearance. Inhalational antibiotics reduce the bacterial burden associated with a worse outcome. Low-dose, chronic macrolide therapy has been shown to decrease exacerbation frequency and airway inflammation. For the first time, a number of therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis are undergoing testing in clinical research trials designed specifically for this population. This concise clinical review focuses on the major etiologies, diagnostic testing, microbiology, and management of patients with adult non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Systematic evaluation identifies a specific cause in the majority of patients and may affect subsequent treatment. We outline current therapies and review the data that support their use.

### Cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia share extensive similarities: is It time to place them under a common umbrella? [^a273b965]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

The inherent impairment of the mucociliary escalator in CF and PCD raises the question of their distinction from all other bronchiectatic diseases. We believe that the extensive similarities in their clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic features, as summarized in Table 1, are sufficient to place them under a common umbrella and differentiate them from bronchiectasis attributed to other causes. We propose the term "non‐CF, non‐PCD bronchiectasis" or "non‐primary mucociliary disease bronchiectasis" to be used in the literature and the design of clinical and translational research, to clearly separate PCD in the same way as CF is separated from all other bronchiectatic diseases. This distinction will eventually enhance the personalized management of both PCD and the "non‐CF, non‐PCD" bronchiectasis patients in clinical practice.

Areas of future research — Airway clearance research in bronchiectasis due to CF or non-CF bronchiectasis has been underwhelming due to the lack of adequately powered randomized controlled trials, and future studies assessing the optimum method, duration, and frequency for long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance with clinical important outcomes are needed. Priorities include targeting primary outcomes such as exacerbation rate, hospitalization rate, quality of life using an instrument validated in CF and/or bronchiectasis, or mortality; testing whether regular daily airway clearance improves outcomes; defining the optimum method for long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance; and defining the optimum duration and frequency for daily long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance.

### Diagnosing and preventing chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis [^650d606c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Current diagnostic labelling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology has substantial limitations. These include the requirement for two high resolution computerised tomography [HRCT] scans (with associated adversity of radiation) if criteria is adhered to, adoption of radiological criteria for children from adult data, relatively high occurrence of false negative, and to a smaller extent false positive, in conventional HRCT scans when compared to multi-detector CT scans, determination of irreversible airway dilatation, and absence of normative data on broncho-arterial ratio in children. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails protracted bacterial bronchitis (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by HRCT (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggests that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (eg immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe 'irreversible' radiological bronchiectasis.

### Multidimensional severity assessment in bronchiectasis: an analysis of seven European cohorts [^4c842b06]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous, poorly understood, multidimensional disease with recent UK and German data demonstrating increasing prevalence and hospitalisation rates. Management is challenging as there are no licensed therapies. Given that the majority of available treatments are antibiotic-based, it is important for antimicrobial stewardship to target treatments to patients at severe risk of complications and avoid over-treatment of mild patients at low future risk.

Two composite disease-specific prognostic indices have been developed for bronchiectasis to aid clinical decision-making: the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and the FACED score. Both attribute points according to age, value of FEV₁% predicted, presence of chronic colonisation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, radiological extension and type of bronchiectasis and degree of dyspnoea. The BSI also considers body mass index, exacerbation frequency, prior hospitalisation for severe exacerbation and chronic colonisation with bacteria other than P. aeruginosa. Both scores classify patients into low, moderate and high risk groups, using different thresholds. The BSI was derived from a large Edinburgh-based study in the UK and was subsequently validated in four international cohorts. The FACED score was derived from a retrospective Spanish study and was recently independently evaluated in a single centre UK cohort of 74 patients for long-term prediction of mortality.FACED was developed specifically to predict mortality, while the BSI was developed to predict mortality, severe exacerbations, frequency of exacerbations and quality of life (QoL).

The data currently available suggest that both scores can predict future mortality in bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is not, however, a disease whose impact is primarily measured in terms of mortality. Outcomes other than mortality are likely to be more important in terms of patients priorities, clinical decision-making, healthcare utilisation and socioeconomic costs. Clinicians face two major challenges in the management of bronchiectasis: (1) identifying patients with a high symptom burden or those at risk of frequent exacerbations or rapid lung function decline who may benefit from aggressive treatment and (2) identifying low-risk patients who could be suitable for non-specialist follow-up or simpler treatment regimes. No therapy has been developed that can reduce mortality in bronchiectasis, but existing and developing therapies are designed to improve QoL, reduce symptoms, reduce exacerbations and slow disease progression. Therefore for clinical trial design and subsequent 'real world' decision-making, these are the key outcomes to identify. The concept of 'severe' bronchiectasis should therefore reflect patients with impaired QoL, severe symptoms, frequent exacerbations and progressive disease.

### Bronchiectasis… [^103c2c7f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease with distinctive radiographic findings characterized by irreversible dilatation of small- and medium-sized bronchi from recurrent and prolonged infections or inflammation. The most common complaint is a chronic wet cough from impaired mucus clearance and subsequent airway plugging, but symptoms can also include hemoptysis, weight loss, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Patients may also have concurrent moderate or severe persistent asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or snoring secondary to sleep apnea. Broadly, the underlying etiology of bronchiectasis is cystic fibrosis or a non-CF process such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, immunodeficiencies, airway obstruction secondary to tumor or foreign body, neuromuscular disorders with poor cough and airway clearance, or genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Those diagnosed as having bronchiectasis before age 6 months often have histories of chronic lung disease, prematurity, poor weight gain, and failure to thrive. When patients. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.

### Defining pulmonary exacerbation in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [^87063319]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Exacerbations in non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis are associated with worsening lung functions and quality of life. A standardized definition of exacerbation could improve clinical care and research.

Objective

To formulate a clinically useful definition of pulmonary exacerbation for pediatric non-CF bronchiectasis.

Methods

A cohort of 69 children with non-CF bronchiectasis was prospectively followed for 900 child-months. The changes in clinical, systemic, and lung function parameters from 81 exacerbations were statistically evaluated using conditional logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) to formulate a definition of a pulmonary exacerbation. Formation of major and minor criteria was statistically based and models were developed.

Measurements and Main Results

Wet cough and cough severity (score ≥ 2) over 72-hr were the best predictors of an exacerbation with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79–0.92) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.77–0.91), respectively. Sputum color, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest signs were significant though minor criteria. Inclusion of serum C-reactive protein, amyloid-A, and IL6 to the definition improved its specificity and PPV. Our final combined model consisted of one major with one investigatory criterion (PPV 91%, NPV 72%); two major criteria (PPV 79%, NPV 91%); or one major and two minor criteria (PPV 79%, NPV 94%).

Conclusions

Pulmonary exacerbation in children with non-CF bronchiectasis can be validly predicted using a standardized assessment of clinical features, with additional systemic markers improving predictive values. This definition potentially facilitates earlier detection (leading to appropriate management) of exacerbations.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^26b63776]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical characteristics and management of bronchiectasis

Bronchietasis patients are clinically characterized by sputum production (upon exercise or spontaneously) leading to productive coughing with mucopurulent masses of yellowish, greenish or brown sputum in the morning or over the day. However, bronchiectasis are mainly detected at time points when irreversible structural damage has already been done to the airway architecture. Bronchiectasis initially may be reversible in children, later probably not. Major genetic diseases associated with bronchiectasis include CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, Kartagener syndrome), alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary immunodeficiencies or other rare disorders like Williams-Campbell syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Major acquired causes are severe bacterial infections (Tuberculosis, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and others) or postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. Notably, also fungal infections can lead to bronchiectasis, particularly ABPA, as a chronic Th2-driven Aspergillus fumigatus -caused pulmonary condition. Based on this, it is essential in the clinical work-up of patients featuring bronchiectasis to screen for these congenital and acquired conditions in order to tailor appropriate treatments and to attenuate disease progression. In a preventive manner, it is key in the above mentioned conditions to diagnose and monitor for pulmonary symptoms and structural changes (using pulmonary function testing and high-resolution computed tomography, HRCT) to avoid established bronchiectasis-related disease. To this end, it is helpful to follow a concept that has been introduced previously to classify forms of bronchitis in children. An acute bronchitis, usually triggered by a viral infection, resolves within days or one to two weeks. Sometimes – for many reasons of which most are unknown – symptoms do not resolve spontaneously, but persist. This state is called protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). While PBB has been initially established for pediatrics, current publications have discussed and transferred this concept to adults {Birring, 2015 #16382; Gibson, 2010 #16381; Martin, 2015 #16380}. PBB is further differentiated into various forms, depending on the tools used to diagnose it. PBB can be further characterized based on different stratifiers:
PBB-microbiologic ("PBB-micro"): (1) presence of chronic wet cough (> 4 weeks), (2) respiratory bacterial pathogens growing in sputum or BAL at density of a single bacterial specifies > 10⁴ colony-forming units/ml, and (3) cough resolves following a 2-week course of an appropriate oral antibiotic (usually amoxicillin-clavulanate)
PBB-clinical: (1) presence of chronic wet cough (> 4 weeks), (2) absence of symptoms or signs of other causes of wet or productive cough, (3) cough resolves following a 2-week course of an appropriate oral antibiotic (usually amoxicillin-clavulanate)
PBB-extended: as above, but cough resolves only after 4 weeks of antibiotics
PBB-recurrent: > 3 episodes of PBB per year

Initial presentation of bronchiectasis

A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be suspected when a patient presents with a recurrent or persistent (> 8 weeks) cough, with production of purulent or mucopurulent sputum, particularly with the relevant associated risk factors, such as COPD. This diagnosis is particularly likely if the patient has a history of two or more COPD exacerbations per year and a previous positive sputum sample for Pseudomonas aeruginosa whilst stable (i.e. not during an exacerbation).

A meta-analysis of six observational studies of 881 patients, mainly based on secondary care, found that the prevalence of bronchiectasis was 54.3% in patients with COPD. One study conducted in 110 patients from 29 UK general practices showed that the prevalence of bronchiectasis was 29% in patients with COPD. Patients with bronchiectasis and COPD had a lower FEV₁-weighted mean difference (WMD) — 8%, more frequent exacerbations (WMD 1.54 times more in the previous year) and 7.33 times more likely to have persistent sputum pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa than COPD patients without bronchiectasis.

In addition to coincident presentation with COPD, a diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be suspected in patients presenting with persistent cough, who also report difficult-to-treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic rhinosinusitisor the presence of persistent sputum pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa.

### Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^e3f9fd6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ß-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV₁ ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I² = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV₁), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I² = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I² = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I² = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^1d3a0d3e]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) and other causes, airway clearance is one of the mainstays of management. We conducted a systematic review on airway clearance by using non-pharmacological methods as recommended by international guidelines to develop recommendations or suggestions to update the 2006 CHEST guideline on cough.

Methods

The systematic search for evidence examined the question, "Is there evidence of clinically important treatment effects for non-pharmacological therapies in cough treatment for patients with bronchiectasis?" Populations selected were all patients with bronchiectasis due to CF or non-CF bronchiectasis. The interventions explored were the non-pharmacological airway clearance therapies. The comparison populations included those receiving standard therapy and/or placebo. Clinically important outcomes that were explored were exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, and mortality.

Results

In both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis, there were systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews identified. Despite these findings, there were no large randomized controlled trials that explored the impact of airway clearance on exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, or mortality.

Conclusions

Although the cough panel was not able to make recommendations, they have made consensus-based suggestions and provided direction for future studies to fill the gaps in knowledge.

### The economic burden of bronchiectasis-known and unknown: a systematic review [^5450d2ac]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis experience daily respiratory symptoms, such as chronic cough, sputum production, and exacerbations. These symptoms cause significant morbidity, reducing physical performance, and severely affecting a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Improving the quality of care for patients with bronchiectasis is paramount in limiting the impact of disease burden on daily functioning.

Management of bronchiectasis aims to control symptoms, reduce the incidence of exacerbations, and prevent disease progression. This is achieved through a multifaceted approach that includes airway clearance therapies, such as physiotherapy and/or exercise, antibiotic therapy, and anti-inflammatory treatment. In addition, hospitalization and antibiotic treatment may be required for the management of exacerbations. For these reasons, care is provided in both primary and secondary settings, and the provision of care may shift between these settings over the course of the disease. Indeed, the structure and intensity of healthcare resource use for the management of bronchiectasis may vary across different settings.

Although non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis has been a neglected disease, its apparent prevalence is increasing, possibly reflecting improved diagnosis through greater use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. With the rising number of patients requiring appropriate management, a better understanding of the current economic disease burden of bronchiectasis is needed to ensure efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review was to identify literature reporting resource use and costs associated with the management of bronchiectasis in adults, and to identify knowledge gaps. Based on the findings, we present a conceptual framework to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the true burden of bronchiectasis for individuals, healthcare systems, and society.

### Long-term macrolide maintenance therapy in non-CF bronchiectasis: evidence and questions [^6b2fa112]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to antibacterial activity. Until recently, only a small number of studies evaluating macrolides in patients with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis had been published. These were open-label, uncontrolled, short-duration studies that included small numbers of patients. However, these studies suggested that macrolides can reduce exacerbation frequency, reduce sputum volume, and improve lung function in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Three recently published randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies showed that macrolides (azithromycin or erythromycin) taken for between 6 and 12 months led to significant reductions in exacerbation rate and reduced the decline in lung function. In all studies, macrolides were generally well tolerated. The advantages of macrolide maintenance therapy need to be balanced against the risks, which include emergence of bacterial resistance, cardiotoxicity and ototoxicity. In addition, a key need is the consistent definition of endpoints for studies in non-CF bronchiectasis, particularly the definition of exacerbation, to allow systematic data analysis. Existing studies on the use of low-dose macrolides in non-CF bronchiectasis are encouraging, but further studies are needed to define the optimal agent, dose, duration for treatment, and the patients likely to benefit and long-term safety.
