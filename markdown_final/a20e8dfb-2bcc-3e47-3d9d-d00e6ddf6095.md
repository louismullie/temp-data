## Question

Which of the following is not an example of a behavioural variable?

Answer Choices:
A. Product usage.
B. Media usage.
C. Purchase occasion.
D. Personality.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option among product usage, media usage, purchase occasion, and personality is not an example of a behavioral variable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a behavioral variable in marketing and social science. Then, I should verify whether product usage, media usage, and purchase occasion fit that definition. Next, I will examine whether personality is typically treated as a behavioral variable or as something else. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly justify it with the logic and references that support the distinction.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a behavioral variable refers to observable actions or patterns of behavior, such as what people do, how often they do it, and under what circumstances, whereas personality refers to relatively stable internal traits that predispose behavior rather than the behaviors themselves. Wait, let me verify that distinction with sources that separate behavioral/lifestyle factors from personality in classification frameworks, because that will anchor the answer.

> I will now examine the options that look behavioral. Product usage clearly tracks observable consumption behaviors, media usage captures exposure and engagement behaviors, and purchase occasion reflects situational buying behaviors; these are all classic examples of behavioral segmentation variables used in marketing and consumer research, so they fit the definition of behavioral variables. Hold on, I should verify that these are indeed categorized as behavioral/lifestyle factors in taxonomies that distinguish them from personality; yes, frameworks that organize personal factors consistently list behavioral and lifestyle factors separately from personality, reinforcing that usage and occasion variables are behavioral rather than trait-based.

> Now, let me consider personality. Personality is typically modeled as stable trait dimensions (for example, the Big Five) that influence behavior but are not themselves behaviors; they are internal predispositions rather than observable actions. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if personality could be considered behavioral because traits manifest in behavior, but that would conflate the driver with the action; the correct distinction is that personality is a trait variable, not a behavioral variable, even though it shapes behavior. I should double-check that this separation is reflected in both theoretical and empirical work; indeed, studies and reviews consistently treat personality as distinct from behavioral outcomes and usage patterns, and classification schemes place personality in a different category from behavioral/lifestyle factors, confirming that personality is not a behavioral variable [^41f88de6].

> Putting this together, the answer is D, personality, because personality represents internal, relatively stable traits rather than observable behaviors, whereas product usage, media usage, and purchase occasion are direct measures of behavior. I should confirm that this aligns with standard teaching and practice in consumer behavior and psychology; yes, the distinction between trait variables and behavioral variables is fundamental in segmentation and psychometrics, and that is exactly why personality is not considered a behavioral variable in this context [^b82b8e81].

---

The correct answer is **D. Personality**. Personality is a **psychological trait** and not a behavioral variable, whereas product usage, media usage, and purchase occasion are direct measures of consumer behavior [^b82b8e81].

---

## Definitions and distinctions

Behavioral variables are **observable actions or patterns** of consumer behavior, such as purchasing, usage, and media consumption. In contrast, **personality traits** are stable, internal psychological characteristics that influence behavior but are not behaviors themselves [^b82b8e81].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Description** | **Classification** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Product usage | Frequency and manner of product use | Behavioral variable |
| B. Media usage | Patterns of media consumption | Behavioral variable |
| C. Purchase occasion | Context and timing of purchases | Behavioral variable |
| D. Personality | Stable psychological traits | Not a behavioral variable |

---

Product usage, media usage, and purchase occasion are all **direct measures of consumer behavior** and are commonly used in marketing research to segment and analyze consumer behavior. Personality, however, is a psychological trait that influences behavior but is not itself a behavior [^b82b8e81].

---

## Conclusion

Personality is **not a behavioral variable** because it represents internal psychological traits rather than observable behaviors. The correct answer is **D. Personality**.

### A systematic review comparing two popular methods to assess a type D personality effect [^8d25f3d3]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type D personality, operationalized as high scores on negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI), has been associated with various medical and psychosocial outcomes. The recent failure to replicate several earlier findings could result from the various methods used to assess the Type D effect. Despite recommendations to analyze the continuous NA and SI scores, a popular approach groups people as having Type D personality or not. This method does not adequately detect a Type D effect as it is also sensitive to main effects of NA or SI only, suggesting the literature contains false positive Type D effects. Here, we systematically assess the extent of this problem.

Method

We conducted a systematic review including 44 published studies assessing a Type D effect with both a continuous and dichotomous operationalization.

Results

The dichotomous method showed poor agreement with the continuous Type D effect. Of the 89 significant dichotomous method effects, 37 (41.6%) were Type D effects according to the continuous method. The remaining 52 (58.4%) are therefore likely not Type D effects based on the continuous method, as 42 (47.2%) were main effects of NA or SI only.

Conclusion

Half of the published Type D effect according to the dichotomous method may be false positives, with only NA or SI driving the outcome.

### A systematic review of volitional personality change research [^954bdd30]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Personality traits could be actionable targets for public interventions because they have been theorized to impact health, well-being, and relationships and many people are intrinsically motivated to change aspects of their personality. However, the mere desire to change one's personality seems to be only weakly related to actual trait changes, with associations differing across studies and traits. Thus, interventions may be needed to successfully promote VPC. We found promising evidence for the efficacy VPC interventions, with an average effect of d = 0.22 for desired personality trait change. These changes appeared to last over up to 12 months and could be detected in both self- and other-reports of personality. However, there still is little evidence for the specific change mechanisms and moderators, leaving it open what constitutes or may affect a successful VPC intervention.

### Personality changes related to presence and treatment of substance use (disorders): a systematic review [^46bf5284]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Heavy substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUD) have complex etiologies and often severe consequences. Certain personality traits have been associated with an increased risk for SU(D), but far less is known about personality changes related to SU(D). This review aims to synthesize the existing literature on this research question. A systematic literature search was conducted from November 2022 to February 2023 in PubMed, EbscoHost, and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed original papers on SU(D)-related personality changes were included. Of 55 included studies, 38 were observational population-based studies and 17 were intervention studies. Overall, personality and SU measures, samples, study designs, and statistical approaches were highly heterogenous. In observational studies, higher SU was most consistently related to increases in impulsivity-related traits and (less so) neuroticism, while interventions in the context of SU(D) were mostly associated with increases in conscientiousness and self-efficacy and lasting decreases in neuroticism. Findings for traits related to extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness were mixed and depended on SU measure and age. Studies on bidirectional associations suggest that personality and SU(D) both influence each other over time. Due to their strong association with SU(D), impulsivity-related traits may be important target points for interventions. Future work may investigate the mechanisms underlying personality changes related to SU(D), distinguishing substance-specific effects from general SU(D)-related processes like withdrawal, craving, and loss of control. Furthermore, more research is needed to examine whether SU(D)-related personality changes vary by developmental stage and clinical features (e.g. initial use, onset, remission, and relapse).

### Leukocyte telomere length and personality: associations with the big five and type D personality traits [^ba5f8d7a]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this 6-year longitudinal study is to examine the relation between personality (i.e. the Big Five and Type D personality traits) and TL measured in leukocytes (LTL) across two time points among adults with a wide age-range, with and without the inclusion of lifestyle factors. In line with the current literature, we hypothesized that lower conscientiousness is related to shorter LTL. Moreover, we speculated that higher neuroticism, lower agreeableness, and Type D personality may be related to shorter LTL, given their associations with adverse health outcomes. Additionally, we examined whether the relation between personality and LTL differed by having a depression and/or anxiety disorder. Finally, we examined whether psychiatric status influenced the relation between personality and LTL.

### Personality changes related to presence and treatment of substance use (disorders): a systematic review [^7047547a]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 55 studies that met the inclusion criteria (publication dates: 1986–2022), 38 were observational studies on SU-related personality changes in population samples (Table 1) and 17 were (clinical) intervention studies in individuals with or at high risk for SU(D) (Table 2). Because the literature search yielded a plethora of personality constructs, we created eight clusters based on conceptual overlap among them: extraversion-related traits, neuroticism-related traits, openness-related traits, conscientiousness-related traits, agreeableness-related traits, impulsivity-related traits, self-efficacy/self-esteem-related traits, and other. See online Supplementary Table S3 for more information. We did this to better structure the results and to identify similarities and differences in the findings.

### Leukocyte telomere length and personality: associations with the big five and type D personality traits [^bc870cad]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Backgrounds

Accelerated cellular ageing, which can be examined by telomere length (TL), may be an overarching mechanism underlying the association between personality and adverse health outcomes. This 6-year longitudinal study examined the relation between personality and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) across time among adults with a wide age-range.

Methods

Data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used and included patients with a depression and/or anxiety disorder and healthy controls. Overall, 2936 persons (18–65 years, 66% female) had data on LTL at baseline and 1883 persons had LTL at 6-year follow-up. The Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and Type D personality were assessed.

Results

Neuroticism was negatively (B = −2.11, p = 0.03) and agreeableness was positively (B = 3.84, p = 0.03) related to LTL measured across two time points, which became just non-significant after adjusting for somatic health, lifestyle factors, and recent life stress (B = −1.99, p = 0.06; and B = 3.01, p = 0.10). Type D personality was negatively (B = −50.16, p < 0.01) related to LTL across two time points, which still remained statistically significant after full adjustment (B = −47.37, p = 0.01). Associations did not differ by age, gender, and current psychiatric status.

Conclusions

The Big Five traits high neuroticism and low agreeableness, and Type D personality were associated with shorter LTL measured across a 6-year period. Associations with the Big Five traits became non-significant after controlling for somatic health, lifestyle factors, and recent life stress, yet similar trends were observed. Type D personality remained independently associated with shorter LTL after full adjustment.

### Leukocyte telomere length and personality: associations with the big five and type D personality traits [^41f88de6]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Personality can be defined in various ways, but the most widely accepted personality framework is the Five Factor Model (John et al.). This model consists of the following five personality traits: neuroticism (emotionally unstable and easily anxious), extraversion (outgoing), conscientiousness (efficient and organized), agreeableness (friendly and compassioned), and openness to experience (inventive and curious), the so-called 'Big Five'. There is increasing evidence that aspects of personality are associated with adverse health outcomes. In detail, individuals who score low on conscientiousness have an increased risk of early mortality (Kern & Friedman; Jokela et al.). Furthermore, high neuroticism (Wilson et al; Chapman et al.) and low agreeableness (Weiss & Costa,) have been related to an increased risk of mortality, although these findings were not confirmed by a meta-analysis (Jokela et al.). Moreover, the Big Five personality traits high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been related to adverse cardiac events among cardiac patients (Jokela et al; McCann).

More recently, the distressed (Type D) personality was introduced when studying the role of personality in a cardiovascular population (Denollet). Type D personality refers to the combination of the traits negative affectivity and social inhibition (Denollet). People scoring high on negative affectivity have a tendency to experience negative emotions, whereas individuals who score high on social inhibition have a tendency to inhibit self-expression. Persons with high scores on both personality traits are classified as having a Type D personality (Denollet). Although Type D personality is positively and negatively related to the Big Five traits neuroticism and extraversion respectively, it is a distinct construct (De Fruyt & Denollet). Studies show mixed findings, where some studies report that persons with a Type D personality have an increased risk of mortality (Denollet; Denollet et al.), others did not (Pelle et al.). Furthermore studies have linked Type D personality to poor outcomes in aging-related somatic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer (Denollet; Mols et al.).

### Personality disorder diagnosis [^3d693f2b]. World Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Every person has a characteristic manner of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. Some of these personality traits can be so dysfunctional as to warrant a diagnosis of personality disorder. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) includes ten personality disorder diagnoses. Three issues of particular importance for the diagnosis of personality disorders are their differentiation from other mental disorders, from general personality functioning, and from each other. Each of these issues is discussed in turn, and it is suggested that personality disorders are more accurately and effectively diagnosed as maladaptive variants of common personality traits.

### Three dimensional approaches to personality disorders: a review on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization [^4b482229]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

The concept of personality functioning (Alternative DSM-5 Model of Personality Disorders) has led to increased interest in dimensional personality disorder diagnosis. While differing markedly from the current categorical classification, it is closely related to the psychodynamic concepts of personality structure and personality organization. In this review, the three dimensional approaches, their underlying models, and common instruments are introduced, and empirical studies on similarities and differences between the concepts and the categorical classification are summarized. Additionally, a case example illustrates the clinical application.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies demonstrate the broad empirical basis, validated assessment instruments and clinical usefulness of the dimensional concepts. Their advantages compared to the categorical approach, but also the respective differences, have been demonstrated empirically, in line with clinical observations.

Summary

Evidence supports the three dimensional concepts, which share conceptual overlap, but also entail unique aspects of personality pathology, respectively.

### Three dimensional approaches to personality disorders: a review on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization [^55a4ebbd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The contemporary classification of mental disorders — DSM-5 and ICD-10 — is based on the assumption that personality disorders (PDs) are a set of categorical and qualitatively distinct entities. Since its introduction 40 years ago, this conceptualization has been challenged by numerous studies suggesting that PDs are not categorical but dimensional constructs, i.e. they can be located on a continuum from well-functioning to highly dysfunctional personality. In addition, the current classification has serious limitations, such as high comorbidity between, and high heterogeneity within PDs, indicating that the notion of PDs as separate constructs may not be valid. The categorical system is considered to hinder progress in research and deemed insufficient for use in clinical practice.

In an effort to address these shortcomings, the DSM-5 Work Group for Personality and PDs proposed the Alternative DSM-5 Model for PDs (AMPD). The AMPD was meant to replace the categorical DSM classification, but was ultimately not adopted to the current official diagnostic codes, while the previous criteria of DSM-IV were maintained for DSM-5. The essential requirement for the presence of a PD are impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A), accompanied by a manifestation of pathological personality traits (Criterion B). The AMPD has stimulated plenty of research and has led to increased interest in dimensional assessments of PDs in general. This includes other new models, such as the PD classification proposal for ICD-11, and previously existing approaches, such as the concepts of personality structure and personality organization.

Personality structure and personality organization are psychoanalytic concepts that substantially influenced the development of the concept of personality functioning. The three concepts differ fundamentally from the current categorical classification of PDs in that they define core pathology dimensions based on disturbances in the self and interpersonal relations, which can be rendered to one global continuum, spanning levels from normal to severely disturbed functioning of personality. While differences between the categorical classification of PDs and dimensional approaches have been reviewed before on a theoretical level, no review has yet compiled empirical studies on that matter (focusing on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization). It is furthermore noteworthy, that — despite common ground — personality functioning has also notable conceptual differences to personality structure and personality organization, which have been pointed out in previous reviews from the perspective of Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD) and object relations theory. However, these reviews were, again, theoretical and whether these concepts are also empirically distinguishable has not been subject of a review before.

### Recognizing and responding to patients with personality disorders [^6cbade4a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Caring for patients with personality disorders and traits presents unique challenges for physicians and other providers. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, recognizes 10 personality disorders, which are organized into 3 clusters (A, B, and C) based on shared diagnostic features. Personality disorders or traits create difficulty in clinical and interpersonal interactions, promoting missed diagnosis or underdiagnosis, nonadherence to medical recommendations, or other dangerous outcomes. It is important to recognize patients with potential personality disorders and understand strategies to achieve optimal patient interactions and best possible medical outcomes.

### Three dimensional approaches to personality disorders: a review on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization [^02f61e71]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Addressing the aforementioned issues, the current paper aims to review studies on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization with a focus on categorical PDs and similarities and differences among the concepts themselves. For this purpose, the concepts are briefly introduced along with their empirical background, assessment instruments, and their clinical relevance, each followed by a review of the studies linking the respective concept with PDs. Studies that investigated associations and differences between the three dimensional concepts themselves are subsequently summarized. Finally, a case example of a patient assessed with interview measures for personality functioning, personality organization, and the categorical classification of PDs is presented to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches in clinical practice.

### Personality disorder: a new global perspective [^46ab355b]. World Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Personality disorder is now being accepted as an important condition in mainstream psychiatry across the world. Although it often remains unrecognized in ordinary practice, research studies have shown it is common, creates considerable morbidity, is associated with high costs to services and to society, and interferes, usually negatively, with progress in the treatment of other mental disorders. We now have evidence that personality disorder, as currently classified, affects around 6% of the world population, and the differences between countries show no consistent variation. We are also getting increasing evidence that some treatments, mainly psychological, are of value in this group of disorders. What is now needed is a new classification that is of greater value to clinicians, and the WPA Section on Personality Disorders is currently undertaking this task.

### Personality disorder across the life course [^aecd6008]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The pervasive effect of personality disorder is often overlooked in clinical practice, both as an important moderator of mental state and physical disorders, and as a disorder that should be recognised and managed in its own right. Contemporary research has shown that maladaptive personality (when personality traits are extreme and associated with clinical distress or psychosocial impairment) is common, can be recognised early in life, evolves continuously across the lifespan, and is more plastic than previously believed. These new insights offer opportunities to intervene to support more adaptive development than before, and research shows that such intervention can be effective. Further research is needed to improve classification, assessment, and diagnosis of personality disorder across the lifespan; to understand the complex interplay between changes in personality traits and clinical presentation over time; and to promote more effective intervention at the earliest possible stage of the disorder than is done at present. Recognition of how personality disorder relates to age and developmental stage can improve care of all patients.

### Personality diatheses: a superior explanation than disorder [^7d36dc4d]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diatheses confer vulnerability to disorder but are not necessarily manifest overtly or consistently. It is suggested that the main empirical findings of studies with abnormal personality support the notion that they are diatheses rather than disorders. This includes their onset early in life, their variability of expression dependent on setting, their greater association with more severe disorders and their acceptance as intrinsic components of functioning by most suffering from these conditions. It is argued that a separate axis of classification for personality diatheses rather than disorders is justified.

### Personality disorders in older adults: a review of epidemiology, assessment, and treatment [^41bdde77]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A literature search was performed between November 2018 and April 2019, using the databases of Medline/Pubmed and PsycINFO, to review papers published between July 2014 and April 2019, describing the epidemiology, assessment, and treatment of personality disorders (PDs) in older adults (≥ 60 years). This interval was chosen in order to include studies published after the most recent literature review on a similar subject matter.

The search consisted of the keywords "personality disorder(s)" or "personality pathology" and "older adults" or "elderly" or "late(r) life", which were required to appear in the article title or abstract. English and Dutch articles of primary empirical studies were included when PDs (conform DSM) in adults aged 60 years and older were the primary focus, and the studies addressed PDs in relation to epidemiology, assessment, or treatment. Articles were excluded if (1) PDs were accessory (e.g. covariate or comorbid condition) or when (2) they addressed personality or (adaptive) personality traits; (3) other than DSM, typologies (e.g. "type A") were used; (4) the main focus was on adults < 60 years; (5) they addressed themes beyond the scope of this review; and (6) it contains primary non-empirical or secondary research (e.g. case-studies, Delphi-studies, and reviews). The abstracts and articles were reviewed by the first author. In the case of doubt, the other authors reviewed the concerning abstracts and/or articles as well. Then, in- or exclusion followed when consensus (agreement between at least 3 authors) was reached. Figure 1 describes the selection process in detail.

### Borderline personality disorder [^c0836d74]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on borderline personality disorder:

- **Definition**: Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder is complex and not fully understood. It is believed to involve interactions among genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors. Genetic factors and adverse life events, such as physical and sexual abuse during childhood, are thought to contribute to the development of the disorder.
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the US is estimated at 5.9%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for borderline personality disorder are multifaceted and include temperamental factors, including high impulsivity and emotional instability; environmental factors, including maltreatment such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, borderline personality disorder is marked by emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies. Other key manifestations include intense mood swings, fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, and a distorted self-image.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of borderline personality disorder is variable. While the disorder is traditionally considered chronic and intractable, up to 85% of patients remit over a 10-year period.

### Identity domains capture individual differences from across the behavioral repertoire [^bcacbd1a]. Nature Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Personality traits can offer considerable insight into the biological basis of individual differences. However, existing approaches toward understanding personality across species rely on subjective criteria and limited sets of behavioral readouts, which result in noisy and often inconsistent outcomes. Here we introduce a mathematical framework for describing individual differences along dimensions with maximum consistency and discriminative power. We validate this framework in mice, using data from a system for high-throughput longitudinal monitoring of group-housed male mice that yields a variety of readouts from across the behavioral repertoire of individual animals. We demonstrate a set of stable traits that capture variability in behavior and gene expression in the brain, allowing for better-informed mechanistic investigations into the biology of individual differences.

### Personality disorders in time of pandemic [^12960740]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major threat to public health. After the first outbreak in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 and the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the virus is still consistently spreading in 216 countries, with more than 29 million patients infected and more than 900,000 deaths by the time we are writing. 1

In light of these events, psychological responses to pandemic situations have become a major topic of interest, both from a research and clinical point of view. Empirical studies and scientific reviews about the consequences of pandemics and quarantine measures in terms of mental health are concordant in concluding that both short- and long-term negative psychological effects can be observed in community people and healthcare workers. Moreover, a recent review suggests relevant negative psychological effects of pandemics also in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. However, little is known on the specific effects of pandemics on patients with personality disorders (PDs).

Empirical literature on the effect of pandemic on patients with personality pathology, however, lacks. PDs are severe mental disorders that manifest with moderate to severe impairment in both self and interpersonal functioning. That is, such patients show serious difficulties in emotion regulation and interpersonal relationships. Since pandemic showed to be a stressful event with consequences on emotions and social life, we can expect that it might represent a relevant risk factor for the exacerbation of negative psychological consequences specifically connected to personality pathology. Furthermore, the pathological personality traits showed by individuals with PDs might pose difficulties in compliance with mitigation measures needed during pandemic outbreaks.

For these reasons, we performed a narrative review of studies investigating pandemic-related mental health issues and in particular including only issues related to PDs and personality traits. Considering the paucity of studies on this topic, after a description of the main features of PDs, on the basis of the current literature on pandemic and quarantine mental health impact, we aim at tracing some clinical hypotheses on the negative psychological effects of pandemic situations in people with PDs. Furthermore, we aim at investigating the role of personality pathology in compliance with mitigation-related behaviors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for borderline personality disorder, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, APA 2024 guidelines recommend to include the following in the initial assessment of patients with possible borderline personality disorder:

- the reason the individual is presenting for evaluation

- the patient's goals and preferences for treatment

- a review of psychiatric symptoms, including core features of personality disorders and common co-occurring disorders

- a psychiatric treatment history

- an assessment of physical health

- an assessment of psychosocial and cultural factors

- a mental status examination

- an assessment of the risk of suicide, self-injury, and aggressive behaviors.

### Three dimensional approaches to personality disorders: a review on personality functioning, personality structure, and personality organization [^8deee3ef]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to the present day, one study used construct-specific interviews for both, personality functioning and personality organization. That study delivers preliminary evidence of differential properties of these constructs in relation to clinical criteria, as "identity", "primitive defenses", "aggression", and "reality testing" (subdomains of personality organization) were significantly correlated with the number of suicide attempts when controlling for overall personality functioning. Conversely, "empathy" (subdomain of personality functioning) was significantly correlated with the severity of diagnosis when controlling for overall personality organization. Concerning discriminant features of personality functioning and personality structure, an expert rating-based study suggests that some personality structure subdomains such as "bodily self", "affect communication", and "use of introjects" might not be sufficiently covered by the concept of personality functioning. To our knowledge, these studies on differences of personality functioning, compared to personality organization and personality structure, are the only of their kind. Yet they highlight the importance of studying their differential aspects, as they point to the possibility that these concepts each might entail unique facets that complement the respective other concepts.

### Personality and depressive symptoms: individual participant meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies [^5a01f4be]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Personality is suggested to be a major risk factor for depression but large-scale individual participant meta-analyses on this topic are lacking.

Method

Data from 10 prospective community cohort studies with 117,899 participants (mean age 49.0 years; 54.7% women) were pooled for individual participant meta-analysis to determine the association between personality traits of the five-factor model and risk of depressive symptoms.

Results

In cross-sectional analysis, low extraversion (pooled standardized regression coefficient (B) = -.08; 95% confidence interval = -0.11, -0.04), high neuroticism (B = .39; 0.32, 0.45), and low conscientiousness (B = -.09; -0.10, -0.06) were associated with depressive symptoms. Similar associations were observed in longitudinal analyses adjusted for baseline depressive symptoms (n = 56,735; mean follow-up of 5.0 years): low extraversion (B = -.03; -0.05, -0.01), high neuroticism (B = .12; 0.10, 0.13), and low conscientiousness (B = -.04; -0.06, -0.02) were associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms at follow-up. In turn, depressive symptoms were associated with personality change in extraversion (B = -.07; 95% CI = -0.12, -0.02), neuroticism (B = .23; 0.09, 0.36), agreeableness (B = -.09; -0.15, -0.04), conscientiousness (B = -.14; -0.21, -0.07), and openness to experience (B = -.04; -0.08, 0.00).

Conclusions

Personality traits are prospectively associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms, in turn, are associated with changes in personality that may be temporary or persistent.

PERSONALITY AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY CAN RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS: personality and psychopathology can influence the presentation or appearance of one another (pathoplastic relationships); they can share a common, underlying etiology (spectrum relationships); and they can have a causal role in the development or etiology of one another. Each of these possible forms of inter-relationship is considered in this paper.

### Personality and anxiety disorders [^681e699b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Personality traits and most anxiety disorders are strongly related. In this article, we review existing evidence for ways in which personality traits may relate to anxiety disorders: 1) as predisposing factors, 2) as consequences, 3) as results of common etiologies, and 4) as pathoplastic factors. Based on current information, we conclude the following: 1) Personality traits such as high neuroticism, low extraversion, and personality disorder traits (particularly those from Cluster C) are at least markers of risk for certain anxiety disorders; 2) Remission from panic disorder is generally associated with partial "normalization" of personality traits; 3) Anxiety disorders in early life may influence personality development; 4) Anxiety disorders and personality traits are usefully thought of as spectra of common genetic etiologies; and 5) Extremes of personality traits indicate greater dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders.

### Are big five personality traits associated to suicidal behaviour in adolescents? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^e4630269]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Suicidal behaviour is one of the main causes of death worldwide, especially among teenagers, and its development is potentially associated with the development of personality. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to describe the association between the Big Five Personality Traits and suicidal behaviour in adolescents.

Methods

Seven databases were systematically searched between June 2022 and July 2022 with no language or year restrictions. We searched for a combination of the following search items (suicid* OR suicidal behaviour OR suicidal ideation OR suicide attempts OR self injury OR self-destructive behaviour OR self-harm OR suicidal risk) AND (personality OR personality traits OR temperament OR neuroticism OR extraversion OR agreeableness OR openness to experience OR conscientiousness) AND (adolescents OR youth OR teenagers OR young adults). Meta-analysis procedures were performed using the R software. A random-effect-model was performed for the models through the incorporation of τ 2, based on the DerSimonion Lard method.

Results

Seven studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Our meta-analysis showed that higher neuroticism are both associated and a risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Higher levels of openness to experience and agreeableness, and lower levels of extraversion and conscientiousness, were linked to suicidal behaviour, especially self-harm.

Limitations

Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, we were only able to perform meta-analysis regarding neuroticism.

Conclusion

The present study may help professionals to identify adolescents in higher risk for suicidal behaviour, enabling the development of early interventions to prevent suicidality in this population.

### Life-history trade-offs favour the evolution of animal personalities [^6324f97a]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.

Borderline personality disorder in adolescents — Borderline personality disorder affects 1–3% of adolescents and young adults, mostly females, and although typically not diagnosed before age 18 years, onset typically takes place during adolescence. Patients are highly sensitive to rejection and fear abandonment, with impulsive behavior including binge-eating, high-risk sexual behavior, nonsuicidal self-injury, and suicide attempts. These patients often report a history of abuse, neglect, or separation in childhood and 40–70% report a history of sexual abuse.

Wright et al. (2022) propose to replace personality disorders with a new classification of interpersonal disorders. We suggest that the trait model addresses well the limitations of the personality disorder categorical syndromes and accommodates the dynamics asserted as strengths of the interpersonal model. We identify weaknesses of the interpersonal model that explain why it has never been officially adopted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

### Within-and between-person differences in activity factor structure: results from an ecological momentary assessment study [^abda1f73]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Frequent and diverse activity engagement in adulthood has been shown to be associated with a range of favorable health outcomes, including higher cognitive performance, lower risk of dementia, and lower mortality. Activity participation in such studies is usually based on a single time point per measurement occasion, reporting common frequency of activity engagement in the past month or year (e.g.). However, recording activity at a single time point provides a limited representation of activity engagement. Activity participation is unlikely to be stable across months and seasons, let alone across years.

Rather, daily activity choices reflect an individual's dynamic effort to balance personal, social, and environmental demands and goals. Within-person variability in activity participation reflects moment-to-moment adjustments as individuals pursue goals or respond to immediate contextual factors (e.g. time constraints, social obligations). Between-person differences, in contrast, may be shaped by enduring traits (e.g. personality) or semistable characteristics like lifestyle, life stage, or socioeconomic factors. The different rationale in activity choices at the within- and between-person levels is aligned with self-regulation theory, where long-term goals are managed alongside short-term influences (e.g. time constraints) that affect our daily lives. Evaluating this trait versus state distinction is crucial for understanding how individuals maintain a consistent pattern of behavior over time while also adapting their activities to immediate circumstances.

With technological advancement, several studies have moved toward daily and momentary activity data collection. These studies demonstrate that activity engagement varies across days and even within days, providing more accurate information on what activities are engaged in and when. Despite moving to more micro timescales, studies continue to rely on activity domains informed by factor analyses that are based on single time points, which focus on differences between participants. Analyses using single time point data provide little insight into how activities cluster together within a person across micro-level timescales such as days. Examining both the within-person and between-person factor structures of daily activities provides information into how activity engagement operates both as a stable trait-like pattern and as a dynamic, context-sensitive process. The present study fills this gap by evaluating whether and how the factor structure in activity participation differs between persons and within-person using 14 days of activity data collected throughout the day.

### Child development and personality disorder [^4fd8a7ae]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The evidence is surprisingly strong that even early adolescent personality disorders or elevated personality disorder symptoms have a broad range of negative effects well into adulthood, for the most part comparable to or even larger than those of Axis I disorders. Current evidence suggests that the most severe long-term prognosis is associated with borderline and schizotypal PDs and elevated symptoms. And of course, childhood conduct disorder is in a peculiar status, disappearing in adulthood to be manifest as a very severe disorder-antisocial PD-in a minority of those with the adolescent disorder.

### Personality traits differentiate patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls – A meta-analytic approach [^c6672a24]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Expression of specific personality traits has been associated with the presence and disease course of bipolar disorder (BD) in multiple studies. However, until today findings are inconsistent and potentially confounding factors such as age and gender as well as the limited sample size of previous studies make it difficult to generalize these findings. To overcome these limitations and to specify the role of personality traits in the context of BD, we performed a meta-analysis in patients with BD and healthy controls (HC), focusing on the traits of the big three and the big five: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness (O), Conscientiousness (C), Agreeableness (A) and Psychoticism (P).

Methods

Two online databases (Pubmed and Web of Science) were searched systematically to identify relevant articles, including publications up to December 31, 2019. From studies that met our inclusion criteria (n = 18), we extracted relevant data of patients with BD (n = 1694) and HC (n = 2153) and calculated effect sizes for each personality trait. Further, we performed moderator analysis on gender, age, quality score and years of publication.

Results

Our results indicate that patients with BD exhibit higher scores on N (large positive effect size; n = 18, g = 1.44, 95%-CI: 1.11 to 1.77) and lower scores on C (medium negative effect size; n = 6, g = -0.78, 95%-CI: -1.13 to -0.43) and E (small negative effect size; n = 13, g = -0.38, 95%-CI: -0.52 to -0.23) compared to HC. We found a moderating effect of mean age on the effect size of N with smaller differences in N levels between patients with BD and HC in older samples (-0.0437, z = - 3.96, p < 0.0001). Our results were robust with respect to potential publication biases and the inclusion of potentially confounding factors such as gender, age, quality score and years of publication.

Limitations

Due to the lack of available data no subgroup analysis on the effect of mood states of patients and subtypes of BD could be performed. Moreover, our analyses are based on cross-sectional data so that findings should be interpreted with care, especially concerning causal conclusions.

Conclusions

Patients with BD showed differences in several personality traits compared to HC. Our results provide the basis for future research with focus on personality and psychopathology in patients with BD. Identifying the interaction between expressions of personality traits and BD might provide novel approaches in prevention and therapy.

### Alcohol use and personality trait change: pooled analysis of six cohort studies [^fa299be2]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Personality has been associated with alcohol use, but less is known about how alcohol use may influence long-term personality trait change.

Methods

The present study examines associations between alcohol use and change in the five major personality traits across two measurement occasions (mean follow-up of 5.6 years). A total of 39 722 participants (54% women) were pooled from six cohort studies for an individual-participant meta-analysis. Alcohol use was measured as (1) average alcohol consumption, (2) frequency of binge drinking, (3) symptoms of alcohol use disorder, and (4) a global indicator of risky alcohol use. Changes in the five major personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience) were used as outcomes.

Results

Risky alcohol use was associated with increasing extraversion [0.25 T-scores over the mean follow-up of 5.6 years; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07–0.44] and decreasing emotional stability (-0.28; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.08), agreeableness (-0.67; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.36), and conscientiousness (-0.58; 95% CI -0.79 to -0.38). Except the association between alcohol use and extraversion, these associations were consistent across cohort studies and across different measures of alcohol use.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that alcohol use is associated with personality trait changes in adulthood.

### The relationship between early maladaptive schemas and cluster C personality disorder traits: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^95a2877b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster C personality disorders (PDs) prevalence estimates range from 5.0% to 6.7% in the community, to as much as 54% in psychiatric patients. As conceptualized by DSM-5, the cluster's hallmark is self-related anxiety and fearful functioning, and comprises avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive PDs. Avoidant PD (AvPD) is characterized by excessive fears of criticism and rejection, social inhibition and restrain, feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, and oversensitivity to negative evaluation; dependent PD (DPD) by extreme fear of abandonment, submissive behaviours, and emotional dependence on others' nurturance, reassurance, and guidance; and obsessive-compulsive PD (OCPD) by an inflexible fixation on orderliness, mental and interpersonal control, rules, and perfectionism.

SCID-5-AMPD-I Results

The patient displayed an overall level of personality functioning of 2 ("moderate impairment"), thus fulfilling Criterion A of the AMPD for the presence of a PD. In the section of identity, he showed an impaired ability to describe himself coherently and a fluctuation between grandiose and vulnerable appraisals of himself. There were indications of emotionally impulsive and erratic behaviors, oscillating between extreme negative and positive emotions, occasionally altered by a feeling of emptiness. In the section of self-direction, he reported to be able to set goals but to not follow them through until reaching success. He described himself to be living by prosocial standards of behavior, lacking insight in his own internal self and the ability for taking on a meta-perspective while experiencing strong emotions. In the section of empathy, he presented himself apprehensive and sensible towards other people's motivations but finding himself recurrently engaged in fights. He also described a conviction of his own perspective of being superior to other people's opinions, and a reduced ability to understand and reflect the effects of his own behavior on others. In the section of intimacy, he was able to describe some stable relationships; however, closer descriptions seemed to lack depth, reliance, and emotional closeness, even though he claimed to seek for this. A mutuality of regard was described, which, however, was not validated in his behaviors.

### Personality and the bipolar spectrum: normative and classification data for the eysenck personality questionnaire-revised [^cd2d06d9]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Personality traits dispose individuals toward particular affective states and may therefore have an important role in the etiology of affective disorders in particular. Despite being one of the most widely used and well-researched personality instruments, few studies have studied bipolar spectrum disorders using the revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R) (Eysenck HJ, Eysenck SBG. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised. Sevenoaks: UK; Hodder & Stoughton, 1992).

Methods

The EPQ-R was administered to 50 bipolar patients, 50 unipolar patients, and 50 controls matched on age and sex. Participants in clinical groups were euthymic, and participants in the control groups were screened for symptoms of depression.

Results

The EPQ-R scores were most effective at discriminating unipolar patients from controls, such that unipolar patients were higher on neuroticism and lower on extraversion. Bipolar patients showed a similar personality profile to, but were not clearly distinguished from, unipolar patients.

Conclusions

This research provides preliminary normative data for the EPQ-R that complement previous theoretical and empirical work in this area and suggests the usefulness of this tool in a clinical setting.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^881b4e0c]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Change principles — psychotherapy for depression: Participant factors include patient expectations, readiness to change, and attachment, coping, and personality styles. Technical elements include cognitive reappraisals, trying new behaviors, altering behavioral reinforcements, improving interpersonal and social functioning, promoting emotion processing and regulation, and conducting a structured therapy session. Relationship factors emphasize that research has underscored the association between having a positive therapeutic relationship or alliance and positive change; an interdisciplinary task force concluded that evidence supported a demonstrable effect of the alliance and empathy. People seeking treatment need to consider the relationship with a potential provider as it has been shown to be correlated with treatment outcome, and providers should attempt to offer evidenced-based treatment within the context of a positive therapeutic alliance.

### Personality disorders in children and adolescents [^ef21de20]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

The personality disorder (PD) construct continues to be controversial when applied to children and adolescents. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that PDs do occur in youth, and that PDs in youth have meaningful correlates and consequences. We provide a brief review of research on this topic from the past year, and we suggest that evidence for the reality of PDs in youth should be complemented by considerations from the adult PD literature regarding the importance of moving toward a dimensional descriptive system for PDs.

### The relationship between early maladaptive schemas and cluster C personality disorder traits: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f9a3178a]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Dependent Personality Disorder

The DPD prominent EMSs of Dependence/Incompetence, Subjugation, Abandonment/Instability, and Enmeshment/Undeveloped Self, nicely align with the theoretical notion that DPD comprises two independent forms of pathological dependency; emotional and functional. Emotional dependency is characterized by extreme fears of abandonment, beliefs about one's inability to function in the absence of an intimate, nurturing relationship, and extreme needs for physical expressions of tenderness — features captured by the EMSs of Abandonment/Instability and Enmeshment (see also). Indeed, emotional dependency is connected to dysfunctional attachment styles, consistent with the assertion that the Abandonment/Instability EMS is developed due to unmet needs for secure attachment. Further, confirming Young et al.'s hypothesis that Subjugation might build up in response to abandonment, emotionally dependent individuals surrender to others' desires and suppress their own needs and emotions to avoid erratic behaviours or being abandoned by others.

In contrast, functional dependency mainly involves difficulties in decision-making, reluctance to take initiative to begin tasks independently, placing responsibility on others for important life areas, and constant seeking of guidance and reassurance due to lack of self-confidence and feelings of incompetence — aspects largely reflected by the EMS of Dependence/Incompetence. The conceptual overlap between functional dependency and the Dependence/Incompetence EMS is further accentuated by their common etiological pathway, since both are rooted in authoritarian and/or overprotective parenting that jeopardizes autonomous and competent functioning outside the family.

### Cross-sectional associations between personality traits and device-based measures of step count and sedentary behaviour in older age: the lothian birth cohort 1936 [^2c1299e5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Personality traits

Personality was assessed using the 50-item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) questionnaire, that taps into the dimensions of the Five Factor Model (FFM). Participants rated 50 statements with regard to how well they described themselves (e.g. "I am the life of the party") on a 5-point Likert scale from very inaccurate to very accurate, with some items scored positively and some reversed. Dimensions are scored as the sum of statements (reversed as required) relating to that dimension (10 statements per dimension). The IPIP dimensions are Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability (reflecting reversely scored Neuroticism), and Intellect/Imagination (similar to Openness). The scale is a reliable and validated measure of the FFM dimensions.

Covariates

Personality traits, physical activity and sedentary behaviour have all been show to vary by age, gender, and health (including weight status), and the choice of covariates was made based on the recent research linking personality traits and device-based measures of physical activity. Age at personality assessment was expressed in days, and standardised in the models for ease of interpretation. Sex was coded as 1 for men and 2 for women. BMI was entered as a continuous variable. Limiting long-term illness (hereafter long-term illness) was coded as 1 if the participant answered "yes "to both of the following questions: "Do you have any long-standing illness, disability or infirmity? "and "Does this condition limit your activities in any way? "and 0 if they answered "no" to either of the two questions.

Statistical analysis

Males and females were compared using t-tests for continuous, and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Linear regression was used to assess the cross-sectional associations between personality traits and physical activity/sedentary behaviour outcomes. Due to significant correlations between personality traits, we constructed regression models with each of the personality traits separately in addition to those where all traits are entered together. Two models were fitted for each combination of personality trait(s) and each of the three outcomes: sedentary time, sit-to-stand transitions, and step-count. Model 1 controlled for age and sex. Model 2 was the same as Model 1, and additionally controlled for BMI, and long-term illness. Due to the large number of tests conducted, we controlled for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate test. All analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.1.

### Manifestation of borderline personality symptomatology in chronic pain patients under stress: an understated and exacerbated consequence of the COVID-19 crisis [^c6a45a03]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Beyond the mere diagnosis of a personality disorder is the type of personality disorder from which a patient suffers. Based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), there are 3 "clusters" of personality disorders. Cluster A personalities include the paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal, and these patients are often described as "odd or eccentric". Cluster B personalities include the antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic, and patients with such disorders are described as "dramatic, emotional, or erratic". Finally, Cluster C personalities include the avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive, and are generally described as "anxious or fearful". In pain management settings, it is the Cluster B patients who have received the most attention and raise the highest level of concern. In 1996, Elliot et alpublished the first study examining the prevalence of personality disorders in chronic pain patients in an outpatient program using a psychometric measure (the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI)) that had been validated for the identification of the specific personality disorders. The MCMI profiles yielded evidence of a personality disorder in 66% of the study's sample, with 19% identified as suffering from Cluster B personality disorders. Not surprisingly, higher Narcissism Scale scores were associated with higher pain scale ratings at discharge, with higher Borderline Scale scores associated with earlier discharge from the program.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^f0f876e0]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment — personalization and therapeutic alliance: The panel asserted that clinicians face a challenge to meet the patient "where s/he stands", and that clinicians might best help by personalizing treatment approaches, prioritizing shared decision-making, communicating openly and directly, utilizing technologies that improve accessibility, accepting more insurance options or providing sliding-scale fees, and creating a strong therapeutic alliance and treatment engagement. It specifies that compatibility of treatment with a patient's needs can be shaped by demographic characteristics, SES, preferences, values, personality traits, conversational styles, treatment and trauma history, coping mechanisms, support networks, life circumstances, and resource availability, as well as perceived commonalities or differences between patient and provider, and that incongruities can precipitate treatment dropout with potential life-long negative associations. In contexts where data do not generally support one treatment over another, supporting patients in educational and decision-making capacities may increase engagement and overall success of treatment.

### Inefficient prioritization of task-relevant attributes during instrumental information demand [^77805e6f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In natural settings, people evaluate complex multi-attribute situations and decide which attribute to request information about. Little is known about how people make this selection and specifically, how they identify individual observations that best predict the value of a multi-attribute situation. Here show that, in a simple task of information demand, participants inefficiently query attributes that have high individual value but are relatively uninformative about a total payoff. This inefficiency is robust in two instrumental conditions in which gathering less informative observations leads to significantly lower rewards. Across individuals, variations in the sensitivity to informativeness is associated with personality metrics, showing negative associations with extraversion and thrill seeking and positive associations with stress tolerance and need for cognition. Thus, people select informative queries using sub-optimal strategies that are associated with personality traits and influence consequential choices.

### Lessons learned from different approaches towards classifying personal factors [^b82b8e81]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine and compare existing suggestions towards a classification of Personal Factors (PF) of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).

Methods

Qualitative and quantitative content analyses of available categorizations of PF are conducted.

Results

While the eight categorizations greatly differ in their background and structure, the broad content areas covered seem to be similar and reflect the ICF definition of PF. They cover to various degrees 12 broad content areas: socio-demographic factors, behavioral and lifestyle factors, cognitive psychological factors, social relationships, experiences and biography, coping, emotional factors, satisfaction, other health conditions, biological/physiological factors, personality, motives/motivation.

Conclusions

In comparing these categorizations, a common core of content issues for a potential ICF PF classification could be identified and valuable lessons learned. This can contribute to future classification development activities in relation to PF.

### Individual differences in information-seeking [^d94295ad]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Procedure (Experiment 1)

Participants were asked to imagine that their family/friends had rated them on different attributes taken from ref.(for example, 'intelligent', 'unreliable', see Materials for all attributes). In block one, on each of 40 trials participants indicated whether they would want to know how others rated them on a specific attribute using a six-point Likert scale from −3(definitely don't want to know) to +3(definitely want to know), with '0' not included (Supplementary Fig. 2). This was self-paced. Half the attributes were positive and half negative. Traits were presented in a random order.

In block two, to assess Instrumental, Hedonic and Cognitive Utility participants provided the following ratings for each attribute respectively (self-paced): (i) Their expectations regarding how useful each piece of information would be (from −3 ' not useful ' to +3 very useful), which provided an estimate of Instrumental Utility (e.g. how useful would it be to know how others rated you on 'intelligence'?); (ii) How they expect to feel if the rating was revealed to them (from −3 ' very bad' to +3 ' very good') (e.g. how will you feel if you knew how others rated you on 'intelligence'?) and how they expect to feel if the rating was never revealed to them (from −3 ' very bad' to +3 ' very good') (e.g. how will you feel if you never knew how others rated you on 'intelligence'?). The difference between the last two ratings provided an estimate for Hedonic Utility; (iii) How often they think about each attribute (from −3 ' never 'to +3 'very often') (e.g. how often do you think about 'intelligence'?), which provided an estimate of Cognitive Utility. This can be in relation to themselves, to others or to the concept itself. What we are measuring is how often the concept is thought of regardless of the exact context. The questions were selected based on the theory paperin which we had introduced the three utilities of information seeking and suggested these quantifiable predictions. We note that these are not necessarily the only questions one can use to measure the three utilities, but we had proposed them as central ones. Participants also indicated how they expected others would rate them (from −3 'not at all this trait' to +3 'very much this trait'; scores were reversed for negative valanced stimuli) and their confidence in this rating (−3 ' not certain' to +3 'very certain'). The reason we asked about expectations is that it allowed us to then assess whether people were more likely to seek knowledge when they are confident or unconfident about what the information will reveal. Each question was displayed separately for each attribute. Descriptive statistics of these ratings and their inter-relationships are displayed in Supplementary Table 1.

Risk of harm to others in OCD — on rare occasions, individuals with OCD have become distressed and aggressive when others interfered with the performance of compulsive rituals, and in assessing the potential for harm to others, the psychiatrist should consider the possibility that aggressive behavior can be associated with co-occurring disorders such as substance use, impulse control, and personality disorders.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^111af4ab]. APA (2021). High credibility.

APA Guidelines on Evidence-Based Psychological Practice in Health Care — change principles, patient characteristics, and tailoring are emphasized as contributors to outcomes: beyond the therapeutic relationship and therapist characteristics, several change principles cutting across different treatment methods are associated with better outcomes, including promoting treatment credibility, cultivating patients' positive expectancies, offering patients opportunities to practice and learn new behaviors, and fostering corrective experiences. Translating these principles into practice involves providing patients with an informed, compelling, and individualized rationale for the proposed treatment and thoughtfully addressing questions and concerns to build their trust in the treatment approach; when working with patients who have low expectancies, therapists strive to adopt an affiliative and supportive attitude, as this stance is associated with better outcomes among these patients. Psychologists also endeavor to display appropriate emotion in therapy and to create a safe space for patients to express, process, and explore their own emotions. Among the "common factors" are patient characteristics, including positive characteristics, motivation for treatment, greater self-efficacy, and higher levels of functioning, all of which are associated with better treatment outcomes, and treatment outcomes also improve when psychologists adapt psychotherapy to patient race, ethnicity, religion, spirituality, reactance level, stage of change, coping style, and preferences. Based on this research, an effective approach to therapy cultivates patients' positive expectancies, fosters their self-efficacy, and provides them with opportunities to apply and control their problems through the new skills and abilities that they developed in therapy; certain dynamic techniques — connecting current feelings to the past, identifying recurrent patterns, and attending to similarities among relationships — are most effective when the therapeutic relationship is strong, and investment in the therapeutic relationship may be particularly critical in psychotherapy with individuals who have PTSD, other trauma-related disorders, attachment disorders, or personality disorders.

### Personality in essential tremor: further evidence of non-motor manifestations of the disease [^90aaa6e5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain whether patients with essential tremor have distinct definable personality traits.

Methods

A case-control study of patients with essential tremor was carried out to look for differences in personality characteristics. The controls were derived from the same source population. Using the tridimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ), personality traits were assessed in three dimensions: harm avoidance (HA), novelty seeking (NS), and reward dependence (RD). Additional analyses were conducted to address the possibility of selection bias among the patients with essential tremor.

Results

There were 55 patients and 61 controls. There was a difference between patients and controls in HA subscale scores (p = 0.005) but not in NS or RD scores. The difference remained significant in analyses that adjusted for age, sex, race, and education (p = 0.005). HA subscale scores did not correlate with subjective or objective measures of disability or with indices of severity of tremor.

Conclusions

Patients with essential tremor scored higher on the harm avoidance subscale scores than control subjects. HA subscale scores did not correlate with the severity of tremor or with subjective and objective scales of disability, suggesting that the personality profile observed was not entirely related to functional disability caused by the tremor. Longitudinal studies of personality in essential tremor are needed to characterise the stability and evolution of these personality traits within the natural history of the disease process.

### Patterns and associates of cognitive function, psychosocial wellbeing and health in the lothian birth cohort 1936 [^ecb11503]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization defines health in terms of wellbeing across physical, cognitive and social domains of function. Wellbeing in old age is also typically defined as high function across these three domains. In a recent review of the measures used to operationalize successful aging, the authors found that the most commonly used variables to define wellbeing in old age were physical fitness, cognitive functioning, social wellbeing, and life satisfaction, in that order. They also found that a mixture of standardized tests (such as grip-strength or the Mini-Mental State Exam, MMSE) and self-report measures (such as activities of daily living, ADLs) was present in most studies. Furthermore, cross-sectional work on wellbeing in older adults increasingly shows that, although some individuals show good or poor wellbeing consistently across all studied measures, others function relatively well in some measures but poorly in others.

Recent studies have sought to characterize profiles across specific areas of wellbeing in old age as a first step in understanding individual differences in aging e.g. For example, Pruchno et al. investigated physical function in individuals between the ages of 50 and 74 using both objective (physical function and disease) and subjective (self-rated health) indicators. They found that one group performed well on both objective and subjective indicators, another on subjective indicators only, another on objective indicators only, and the last group did not do well on either objective or subjective indicators. Using data from the Berlin Ageing Study (BASE), Smith & Baltes also used both objective and self-rated measures to investigate cognitive ability, personality, and social wellbeing in individuals between the ages of 70 and 103. They identified 9 different profiles of psychological functioning. Most individuals had at least moderately positive profiles, including good cognitive ability, high extraversion, and high engagement in family and social projects. However, many individuals showed profiles that were not consistently 'good' or 'bad' across variables. For example, one group had high cognitive function and loneliness, but low extraversion and little belief that their actions could influence what happened to them. Another group's (rather contradictory) characteristics included high neuroticism, high-perceived control and high belief that actions of other people would determine what happened to them.

### Personality dimensions in first-episode psychoses [^c6264d06]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors compared the patterns and specificity of premorbid personality dimensions in first-episode schizophrenia patients with those in patients with first-episode nonschizophrenia psychoses and healthy comparison subjects.

Method

A series of 63 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, 34 patients with first-episode nonschizophrenia psychoses, and 77 healthy comparison subjects were assessed with the Personality Disorder Evaluation, a semistructured interview schedule that measures personality dimensions.

Results

Cluster A as well as cluster C dimensional scores-in particular, the avoidant personality score-were higher for the schizophrenia patients, and cluster B dimensional scores were higher for the patients with nonschizophrenia psychoses. Cluster C dimensional scores, particularly the avoidant personality score, were highly intercorrelated with all cluster A dimensional scores.

Conclusions

The observed association between avoidant personality and schizophrenia supports the recent literature on the comorbidity of nonspectrum personality disorders in schizophrenia. This association may be related to shared neurodevelopmentally mediated impairments in social cognition in schizophrenia and some cluster C personality dimensions.

### Brain-phenotype models fail for individuals who defy sample stereotypes [^4ad72902]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Individual differences in brain functional organization track a range of traits, symptoms and behaviours 1–12. So far, work modelling linear brain-phenotype relationships has assumed that a single such relationship generalizes across all individuals, but models do not work equally well in all participants 13,14. A better understanding of in whom models fail and why is crucial to revealing robust, useful and unbiased brain-phenotype relationships. To this end, here we related brain activity to phenotype using predictive models-trained and tested on independent data to ensure generalizability 15 -and examined model failure. We applied this data-driven approach to a range of neurocognitive measures in a new, clinically and demographically heterogeneous dataset, with the results replicated in two independent, publicly available datasets 16,17. Across all three datasets, we find that models reflect not unitary cognitive constructs, but rather neurocognitive scores intertwined with sociodemographic and clinical covariates; that is, models reflect stereotypical profiles, and fail when applied to individuals who defy them. Model failure is reliable, phenotype specific and generalizable across datasets. Together, these results highlight the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all modelling approach and the effect of biased phenotypic measures 18–20 on the interpretation and utility of resulting brain-phenotype models. We present a framework to address these issues so that such models may reveal the neural circuits that underlie specific phenotypes and ultimately identify individualized neural targets for clinical intervention.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^0d9cb055]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 11 — psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation: Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation endeavor to recognize the nature of and relationship among individual, gender, and group variability, emphasizing that assessment and interpretation of psychological tests involve understanding similarities and differences within the examinee, the cohort to which such examinee belongs, and the group norm samples used in test construction; some norm-referenced tests (using standard, scaled, percentile and T-scores) classify score deviation by comparison with normative data, and scores outside the broad range of average in a normal distribution may be classified as deviant; due to limitations in the diversity and variability of normative samples, characteristics of an individual examinee may be poorly represented or absent, increasing the chance of misinterpretation for those not appropriately represented (e.g., due to cultural, racial, age, and ethnic differences) because of different individual and cultural characteristics rather than poor performance.

### Childhood attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and the emergence of personality disorders in adolescence: a prospective follow-up study [^83ec7217]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience considerable functional impairment. However, the extent to which comorbid Axis II personality disorders contribute to their difficulties and whether such comorbidities are associated with the childhood condition or the persistence of ADHD into adulthood remain unclear.

Method

This study examined the presence of personality disorders in a longitudinal sample of 96 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD when they were 7 through 11 years old, as compared to a matched, never ADHD-diagnosed, control group (N = 85). Participants were between 16 and 26 years old at follow-up. On the basis of a psychiatric interview, the ADHD group was subdivided into those with and without persistent ADHD. Axis II symptoms were assessed by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, and odds ratios (ORs) were generated. The study was conducted from 1994 through 1997.

Results

Individuals diagnosed with childhood ADHD are at increased risk for personality disorders in late adolescence, specifically borderline (OR = 13.16), antisocial (OR = 3.03), avoidant (OR = 9.77), and narcissistic (OR = 8.69) personality disorders. Those with persistent ADHD were at higher risk for antisocial (OR = 5.26) and paranoid (OR = 8.47) personality disorders but not the other personality disorders when compared to those in whom ADHD remitted.

Conclusion

Results suggest that ADHD portends risk for adult personality disorders, but the risk is not uniform across disorders, nor is it uniformly related to child or adult diagnostic status.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^a13ae628]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Individual differences and moderators of outcomes — trauma-focused (TF) therapies indicate that patient characteristics may make the biggest difference, "accounting for up to 30% of outcome variance", and that a broad range of pretreatment variables predicted TF therapy outcomes. "In a set of 114 studies", slightly poorer TF outcomes were observed in "ethnic minority patients (r = .16), older patients (r = .28), and male patients (r = .12)". Among adult patients with PTSD, worse outcomes were linked to "childhood trauma (r = .28), more cumulative trauma (r = .37), shorter mean elapsed time between their index trauma and therapy onset (r = .55), combat trauma (r = .33), and higher pretreatment PTSD severity". Comorbidities associated with slightly worse outcomes included "depression (r = .42), alcohol misuse (r = .19), higher anger (r = .32), dysfunctional personality traits (r = .44), pain (r = .15), sleep disturbance (r = .45), and poorer overall quality of life (r = .19) including poor social support (r = .30)". Pretreatment markers tied to poorer results included "less activation in fear-related brain regions (r = .44), less psychophysiological reactivity to fear cues (r = .46), genetic risk alleles for fear acquisition (r = .49), but more negative trauma cognitions (r = .37), and poorer executive function (r = .29)", while "neither psychotherapy education nor emotion regulation difficulties were associated with worse outcomes"; it remains "unclear whether these factors are specific to TF therapies", they "may or may not be reliable predictors", and "it is unknown if there is a cumulative effect of having multiple of these pretreatment factors on long-term outcomes".

### Emotions and individual differences shape human foraging under threat [^28d3e738]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Behavioral measures

This task provided rich measures of behavior: participants varied widely in their strategies for approaching the task (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). We analyzed the behavior, deriving measures taking account of this variability (Fig. 1c, d). Task data were epoched into two separate 'phases' for analysis: behavior before a predator had been discovered ('pre-discovery phase') and after ('post-discovery phase'). For each epoch, we extracted aggregate behavioral measures that we then related to task features (for example, how much reward affects the rate of checking or the time to first action in an epoch; Fig. 1d). The task features of key interest were the predator speed and the reward, while we also controlled for other features, including the number of areas to check and the block in the experiment (thereby controlling for performance improvements over time; Supplementary Fig. 4). This provided us with a very rich set of measures with robust links to individual differences on clinical questionnaires. Specifically, 33 behavioral measures (Supplementary Table 5) were extracted from task data (Fig. 1c) related to hiding (for example, how long participants took to return from hiding after disappearance of the predator), foraging (for example, percentage of total time in an epoch spent foraging) or whether the last action before hiding was a forage or a check), or checking (for example, percentage of active (non-hiding) time spent checking) or the interplay among the task, mood (Fig. 2c) and behavior. We then related each behavior to task factors such as reward and threat levels (Fig. 2b). Many measures were affected by changes in reward, threat and number of directions for checking (Supplementary Table 8 has a complete list). For example, when reward was higher, participants returned faster from hiding (P < 0.001) and spent more time foraging (P < 0.001) and less time checking (P < 0.001). When predators were faster, participants were equally faster to return from hiding (P < 0.001) but spent less time foraging (P < 0.001) and more time checking (P < 0.001). In addition, in exploratory analyses, we also used more standard individual-choice decision-making models(Fig. 1e) that applied logistic regressions to each choice participants made (thus not capturing reaction time or mood effects). We show group-level results (Supplementary Table 6), clinical links in exploratory analyses (following) and parameter recovery (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5).

### Meaning attribution to intimate partner violence by counselors who support women with intimate partner violence experiences in Greece [^1551bf66]. Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intimate partner violence:

- **Definition**: Intimate partner violence is defined as any form of aggression or harmful behavior within a romantic relationship. This can include physical, sexual, or psychological harm, as well as controlling behaviors by a current or former partner.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of intimate partner violence is complex and multifaceted, involving an interplay of individual, relational, and societal factors. Substance abuse, mental health issues, and societal norms can also contribute to the occurrence of intimate partner violence.
- **Epidemiology**: Intimate partner violence is a significant global issue and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide within their lifetime.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for intimate partner violence include individual factors such as a history of violent behavior, substance misuse, and the presence of specific personality disorders. Relationship-related factors encompass marital discord, dominance and control dynamics within the relationship, and financial stress. Societal factors include societal norms endorsing male authority over female behavior, rigid gender role distinctions, and the existence of community groups that legitimize male violence.
- **Disease course**: It can manifest in various forms, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Physical abuse often results in injuries, with musculoskeletal injuries being the second most common manifestation. These injuries can range from minor bruises and cuts to severe fractures and burns. It can also lead to sexual violence, which can result in STIs and unintended pregnancies. Emotional abuse, another form of intimate partner violence, can lead to mental health conditions such as depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is often characterized by escalating severity and chronicity. The violence can increase in frequency and severity over time, leading to more serious health consequences for the victim. Victims of intimate partner violence are also at an increased risk of future violence.

### Three steps toward improving the measurement of behavior in behavioral phenotype research [^972d07f5]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

As the numbers of syndrome-specific behavioral articles continue to grow, it seems a good time to pause and take stock of patterns that are emerging across these many studies. This article takes note of these patterns and summarizes the authors' reading of the behavioral phenotype waters. The authors propose that there are (at least) three overarching themes that relate to individual differences within syndromes. These include the roles of (1) development across the lifespan, (2) gender differences, and (3) other subject and environmental factors. The authors end with a cautionary note about measures and the need to supplement (alongside weaknesses and psychiatric vulnerabilities) the strengths and positive affect and attributes of individuals who have genetic syndromes.

### Individual differences in information-seeking [^77122b46]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Vast amounts of personalized information are now available to individuals. A vital research challenge is to establish how people decide what information they wish to obtain. Here, over five studies examining information-seeking in different domains we show that information-seeking is associated with three diverse motives. Specifically, we find that participants assess whether information is useful in directing action, how it will make them feel, and whether it relates to concepts they think of often. We demonstrate that participants integrate these assessments into a calculation of the value of information that explains information seeking or its avoidance. Different individuals assign different weights to these three factors when seeking information. Using a longitudinal approach, we find that the relative weights assigned to these information-seeking motives within an individual show stability over time, and are related to mental health as assessed using a battery of psychopathology questionnaires.

1 INTRODUCTION

Everyday life is full of situations that require behavioral adaptation in order to achieve certain novel goals and further to perform fluently and effortlessly. Initial human learning is often driven by performance feedback signaling whether or not a pursued goal was met. Thereby, we can incrementally learn, which actions lead to desired outcomes or which actions serve to avoid adverse outcomes under given situational context conditions. Hence, feedback‐driven learning is an effective way to establish novel goal‐directed behaviors. But only more extensive training ultimately enables us to handle everyday challenges effortlessly. According to many theoretical accounts (Daw et al; Dickinson; Dolan & Dayan,), human behavior is initially goal‐directed involving the anticipation of future outcomes such that a response to a certain stimulus is selected to either achieve a rewarding outcome or to avoid a punishing outcome. With increasing practice, however, behavior is assumed to become less and less governed by outcome anticipation and instead to become more and more purely stimulus‐bound or habitual. Such habitual behavior is assumed to be controlled directly by stimulus–response (S‐R) associations, rendering our behavior much faster and less resource demanding but also highly inflexible, which is adaptive in a stable environment, but maladaptive in a changing environment (Dickinson; Seger & Spiering). Habitual inflexibility is indicated by reduced sensitivity to outcome de‐ or re‐valuation (de Wit et al; Delorme et al; Dickinson; Ersche et al; Niv et al.). That is, if a stimulus that habitually triggers a response X now requires a different response Y in order to achieve a certain goal, then, initially, there is a perseverative tendency to stick with response X. In contrast, if the original response X was still under goal‐directed control, it could be de‐activated more flexibly by re‐coding the response‐associated outcome representation from "desirable" or "correct" to "non‐desirable" or "incorrect".

### Moderators of the intention-behaviour relationship in the physical activity domain: a systematic review [^e5ec79c6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Intention is theorised as the proximal determinant of behaviour in many leading theories and yet intention-behaviour discord is prevalent. The purpose of this review was to retrieve, theme and appraise the variables that have been evaluated as the potential moderators of the intention-behaviour relationship in the physical activity (PA) domain. Eligible studies were selected from English peer-reviewed journals and had to report an empirical test of moderation of intention-PA (I-PA) with a third variable. Fifty-seven studies passed the inclusion criteria and these represented 38 different potential moderators of I-PA. Intention stability proved to be the most consistent moderator of I-PA, suggesting that much of the discordance may be from motivational flux between initial intention and eventual behaviour. Anticipated regret and conscientiousness also had evidence as the moderators of I-PA. Perceived control/self-efficacy, planning, extraversion, habit and environmental proximity to recreation showed some evidence for moderation, while gender, agreeableness, openness, body mass index and ethnicity did not appear to moderate I-PA. The findings demonstrate that traditional intention theories may need augmentation to better account for the evidence present in I-PA discordance.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Emergence of the behavioral types

In order to identify the behavioral types present in our study sample, we conducted a two‐step cluster analysis of participants' cooperative behavior. This analysis yielded a solution with three distinctive clusters. The first cluster included 26 participants (19.5%) who demonstrated a very high level of cooperation; they contributed on average 19.0 points (95.0% of their endowment; SD = 1.8 points). The second cluster included 32 participants (24.1%) who demonstrated a very low level of cooperation; they contributed on average only 2.3 points (11.6% of their endowment; SD = 2.1 points). The third cluster included 75 participants (56.4%) who demonstrated a moderate level of cooperation; they contributed on average 9.4 points (47.1% of their endowment; SD = 2.2 points). Please note that we also ran an additional two‐step cluster analysis on participants' contribution and belief scores. Both cluster solutions led to the same optimal number of behavioral types and almost identical allocation of the participants to the three behavioral types (see Table S3 for details).

3.2 Characterization of the behavioral types

To characterize the behavioral types that emerged from the cluster analysis, we explored their cooperative behavior in relation to their beliefs about their counterparts' average contributions. This information helps to clarify the motives behind the cooperative or uncooperative behaviors of the distinct behavioral types. For example, did the individuals of the highly cooperative behavioral type contribute almost all of their endowment because they believed everyone would contribute a similar amount? Or did they contribute almost all of their endowment even though they suspected that the others would not contribute as much, thus being aware that their high level of cooperation could be exploited by others who would not be as cooperative? In order to clarify this, we generated a difference score by subtracting the value of participants' beliefs from their own contributions (contribution‐minus‐belief score).

Psychometric and measurement knowledge — Guideline 5 states that psychologists who provide psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation demonstrate knowledge in and seek to appropriately apply psychometric principles and measurement science as well as the effects of external sources of variability such as context, setting, purpose, and population. The rationale emphasizes that descriptive statistics are the foundational components of test construction and interpretation, noting common measures of central tendency and measures of variation. It adds that critical evaluation of instruments requires working knowledge of the fundamental theories and techniques of test construction. The section explains that individual results of most tests are derived from item responses that are grouped to form scales and are reported as raw scores or transformed and presented as normative comparative or standardized scores. On reliability/precision and measurement error, it states that the reliability/precision of test scores depends on how much scores vary across replications and that psychologists are encouraged to become familiar with approaches to reliability/precision estimation and factors that influence the appropriate index(es). On validity, it defines validity as "the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed uses of tests", clarifies that validity is not an inherent property of a test but concerns support for use for a particular purpose, and notes that in evaluating tests, psychologists should become suitably aware of the five sources of validity.

Test selection, scoring, and administration — normative comparison and effort: Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation strive to be aware of the need for test selection, scoring, and administration to reflect the appropriate normative comparison, situation influences, effort, and standardized administration as indicated. The rationale notes that in psychological assessment and testing, psychologists recognize the importance of considering age, gender, ethnicity, primary language, and individual influences when selecting and administering appropriate tests, which allows for valid normative comparisons, classifications, ipsative profiles, and other interpretations to inform recommendations based on test results. It adds that psychologists strive to conduct assessment in adherence with standardized administration procedures and are encouraged to judiciously test within the standardized administration when doing so would allow for appropriate normative comparisons, determine meaningful treatment implications, and/or clarify conditions under which functioning varies. Application guidance states that psychologists strive to select the most appropriate test or instrument for a specific purpose, seek knowledge of psychometric properties, theory and research basis, and normative data to influence selection, and recognize that normative data or decision rules may not be accurate when important features of the client are not represented in the norm group, when administration or scoring procedures do not follow standardization, or when characteristics of the test or instrument may affect its utility for the situation.

### Behavioural determinants of physiologically-relevant light exposure [^a7eb1475]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

This article presents a novel research and intervention framework that integrates these individual light-interactions and behavioural profiles to harness their unique interventional potential. We build our programme on four pillars (Fig. 4). These are (i) understanding (reasons for) individual light behaviours and exposure profiles, (ii) identifying individual target behaviours and personal barriers, (iii) designing interventions that include behaviour change as a key component in the form of behaviour change techniques, and (iv) deliver these interventions effectively and accessibly including an information-behaviour-feedback loop.

Fig. 4
A framework for identifying and delivering precision behavioural health.

The framework consists of four pillars including (A) understanding individual light behaviours and profiles (examples are for yellow and blue profiles of Fig. 2) to then (B) identify individual target behaviours and barriers that hinder optimal light exposure for circadian health. After these two individual steps, (C) individual behaviour change techniques embedded within tailored interventions need to be designed and (D) delivered in effective, simple, and accessible ways. These could also integrate external information sources such as whether data or wearable logging to give feedback on the fly to the user.

### Individual differences in information-seeking [^3b2b2f8b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Procedure (Experiment 3)

Participants were asked to imagine that we possessed a crystal ball that could reveal the answer to any question. In block one, on each of 40 trials they were asked whether they wanted to know specific information related to finance (e.g. what the exchange rate was between Dollar and Pound, what income percentile they fall into etc. see Supplementary Information for all stimuli). On each trial the stimulus were different and differed between Time 1 and Time 2. They indicated their response using a six-point Likert scale from −3 (definitely don't want to know) to +3 (definitely want to know), '0' was not included (Supplementary Fig. 2). This was self-paced.

In block two, participants provided the following ratings for each of the 40 traits: (i) their expectations regarding how useful it would be to know the information (from −3 ' not useful ' to +3 very useful), which provided an estimate of Instrumental Utility (e.g. how useful would it be to know X'?); (ii) How they expect to feel if they knew the information (from −3 ' very bad' to +3 ' very good'; e.g. how will you feel if you knew X?) and how they expect to feel if they never knew the information (from −3 ' very bad' to +3 ' very good'; e.g. how will you feel if you never knew how X?). The difference between the last two ratings provided an estimate for Hedonic Utility; and (iii) how often they think about each topic (from −3 ' never 'to +3 'very often'; e.g. how often do you think about X'?), which provided an estimate of Cognitive Utility. Participants also indicated what they expected the information would be ("what do you think the answer is?"). Depending on the question asked, participants either answered on a scale (e.g. for the question about what the Gross Domestic Profit is, the scale went from "low" to "high") or input their answer into a text box (e.g. for the question about what your daily expenses are). Finally, participants indicated their confidence in what they expected the information would reveal (from −3 ' not certain' to +3 'very certain').

### Pain self-efficacy beliefs and pain behaviour. A prospective study [^fc28096a]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

This study examined the relationship between pain self-efficacy beliefs and a range of pain behaviours, as measured by the pain behaviour questionnaire (PBQ), using a prospective design. A heterogeneous sample of 145 chronic pain patients completed sets of questionnaires on four occasions over a nine-month period. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the subjects' confidence in their ability to perform a range of tasks despite pain (assessed at baseline), was predictive of total pain behaviour and avoidance behaviour over the nine-month study period. This finding was particularly significant because the analyses controlled for the possible effects of pain severity (at each measurement occasion), pain chronicity, age, gender, physical disability, depression, neuroticism and catastrophising. These findings suggest that pain self-efficacy beliefs are an important determinant of pain behaviours and disability associated with pain, over and above the effects of pain, distress and personality variables. In particular, higher pain self-efficacy beliefs are predictive of reduced avoidance behaviours over an extended period.

APA Guidelines for Psychological Assessment and Evaluation — selection, administration, and scoring of tests — states that psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation endeavor to select (a) assessment tools that demonstrate sufficient validity evidence for their uses, sufficient score reliability, and sound psychometric properties and (b) measures that are fair and appropriate for the evaluation purpose, population, setting, and context at hand. Application guidance highlights that psychometric characteristics "include but are not limited to standardization, reliability, and validity" and emphasizes accounting for diversity and limitations, as psychologists are "encouraged to be knowledgeable about and account for the impact of test results in diverse populations and across different settings, as well as the limitations of measures even when guidelines are followed for test selection". Specific application steps include: "Make sure the tool is accessible, appropriate for the purpose, and in the language that one would need to use, within the context of evidence-based practice"; "Become familiar with the administration instructions, scoring, and accurate completion of test protocols and record forms"; and "Practice and observe the administration of an instrument with an appropriate colleague". Additional steps are to "Read and evaluate reviews of the tests or instruments and research studies that used them, including meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and specialized practice parameters, in addition to edited handbooks and volumes on assessment" and to "Read the test or instrument publisher's technical manual(s) and review carefully the design, standardization sample(s) characteristics, descriptive statistics of standardization sample(s), composition and independence of scales, and supporting evidence of validity and reliability". Resource and networking activities include "Explore publishers' websites for up-to-date information on their tests and instruments" and "Join a professional listserv where intellectual discussions take place".

### Dementia is more than memory loss: neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and their nonpharmacological and pharmacological management [^b31ae602]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia:

- **Definition**: BPSD is a heterogeneous range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors occurring in people with dementia of any etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: BPSD are caused due to a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological factors including neurochemical, neuropathological and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: The complex interaction of psychosocial and biological factors results in BPSD, which have clinical manifestations of agitation, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. Disease progression is associated with poor QoL, distress among patients and caregivers, long-term hospitalizations, medication misue, a nd increased health-care costs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Moderate and severe BPSD are associated with an increased risk of mortality with HR 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08–1.60) and 1.74 (95% CI 1.44–2.12), respectively.

### Three diverse motives for information sharing [^e4c47f85]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Knowledge is distributed over many individuals. Thus, humans are tasked with informing one another for the betterment of all. But as information can alter people's action, affect and cognition in both positive and negative ways, deciding whether to share information can be a particularly difficult problem. Here, we examine how people integrate potentially conflicting consequences of knowledge, to decide whether to inform others. We show that participants (Exp1: N = 114, Pre-registered replication: N = 102) use their own information-seeking preferences to solve complex information-sharing decisions. In particular, when deciding whether to inform others, participants consider the usefulness of information in directing action, its valence and the receiver's uncertainty level, and integrate these assessments into a calculation of the value of information that explains information sharing decisions. A cluster analysis revealed that participants were clustered into groups based on the different weights they assign to these three factors. Within individuals, the relative influence of each of these factors was stable across information-seeking and information-sharing decisions. These results suggest that people put themselves in a receiver position to determine whether to inform others and can help predict when people will share information.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e6b82167]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differential diagnosis — Compared with hypochondriasis, patients with hypochondriasis "do not have insight into the irrationality of his or her fears and behaviors", whereas "some insight is usually present in OCD". In body dysmorphic disorder, preoccupations are "limited to the fear or belief that one has a disturbing physical defect, when in reality the defect is nonexistent or slight". In postpartum OCD, distinguishing urges to harm an infant from postpartum depression is emphasized, with the statement that in OCD "there is little risk of direct harm to the infant", whereas in postpartum depression ideas "may be experienced as justified, may not be strongly resisted, and emerge from depressed mood", and "taking steps to protect the infant may be necessary". Motor or vocal tics differ in that "unlike compulsions", they are "neither preceded by thoughts nor aimed at relieving anxiety or preventing or undoing an external, undesired event". OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) "may co-occur", but distinguishing features include that in OCPD the focus is on "doing things my way, the right way", OCD perfectionism is "focal and limited to feared events" while in OCPD such traits "globally color the individual's attitudes and behavior", and the person with OCPD "experiences the concerns and behaviors as part of the normal self and does not resist them".

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^352eb3b6]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (health system-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of health system-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (688 female, 472 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 health system-based care (care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.8 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.67). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.7 points vs. 10.6 points; MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.99) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.7 points vs. 4.69 points; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.55) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.1 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, health system-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### A model for person perception from familiar and unfamiliar voices [^eafdc5d5]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

When multiple person characteristics are recognised, this may happen simultaneously or closely staggered in time, modelling our experience of deriving complex, multi-attribute impressions from unfamiliar voices. Emerging evidence from voice research suggests that this perception of different person characteristics from unfamiliar voices may indeed be structured. For example, impressions of physical characteristics, such as age, sex, and health, are formed more quickly than trait or social characteristics, such as level of education and trustworthiness. Based on this evidence, we tentatively place characteristics like sex and age 'earlier' in the processing chain compared to traits and social percepts in Fig. 3. We furthermore propose possible interactions between characteristics, which can reflect existing patterns of co-occurrence in the population (e.g. sex and height recognition: female talkers are usually smaller than male talkers). Therefore, our model allows for (some) bidirectional effects of facilitation (or inhibition) of any of these characteristics on one other (e.g. a percept of 'female' may facilitate a percept of 'smaller than average height'). Further investigation will need to test whether such interactions of representations primarily happen within the recognition process, for example, through direct mutual co-activation of stored representations, or via yet another route implicating additional systems (e.g. top-down effects of attention or memory).

Our model also includes the potential for bidirectional interactions between the recognition of a person or persona and the recognition of person characteristics. The potential for the recognition of person characteristics to influence the recognition of a known person or persona (upward arrow toward 'Familiar Person(a)' in Fig. 3) describes situations in which an objectively familiar voice is not immediately recognised as such, but where recognition of the specific identity emerges after additional information about the person has been accumulated from the voice signal in a largely bottom-up fashion (e.g. when hearing a low/moderate-familiarity voice). On the other hand, the potential effects of a recognised familiar person or persona on the recognition of person characteristics (downward arrow from Familiar Person(a) in Fig. 3) are perhaps less intuitive. These can, however, account for previous reports that familiarity with a specific person might affect the neural decoding of person sex and age from their face/voice, and evidence that familiarity yields faster judgements of sex from voices.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^a1127131]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 5 — Psychologists aim to cultivate and maintain effective therapeutic relationships, therapist characteristics, and change principles, noting that psychological treatment is provided in the context of a collaborative professional relationship and that the quality of the therapeutic relationship is associated with treatment outcome. Nonspecific "common factors" — including the therapeutic relationship, therapist skills and traits, change principles, and patient characteristics — affect treatment outcome independent of specific techniques, are shared between different therapeutic orientations, and likely account for as much, if not more, outcome variance as the technique itself. The therapeutic relationship powerfully predicts patient outcomes across treatment modalities, therapeutic orientations, treatment delivery mechanisms, and patient age groups, and is characterized by several interrelated facets including empathy, congruence, goal consensus and collaboration, and rupture repairs. Psychologists are mindful that this is not a question of therapeutic relationship OR technique, but relationship AND technique, and applying specific evidence-based techniques in the context of the therapeutic relationship appears to produce incremental benefits for the patient beyond the positive change attributed to "nonspecific factors" such as the therapeutic relationship. Empathy has been conceptualized both as an intrapersonal therapist trait and an interpersonal and interactional relationship quality, with three functional components of empathy — automatic affective sharing, self-other awareness, and conscious perspective-taking and self-regulation including the capacity to inhibit one's own perspective while attending to someone else's — and therapy researchers differentiate among three modes of therapeutic empathy, including establishment of rapport, moment-to-moment attunement to the patient's communication, and understanding of the patient's current experiencing within the context of their personal history. Like empathy, congruence has intrapersonal and interpersonal facets; the intrapersonal facet is characterized by genuineness, personal awareness, and authenticity, and the interpersonal facet includes the capacity to articulate one's experience to another person transparently. Psychologists aspire to build congruent therapeutic relationships by being open to joint experiencing with patients, owning their emotions and reactions, and being willing to reflect on their experiences aloud in therapy, with congruent responses that may include targeted self-disclosure or articulation of one's own thoughts and feelings; to maintain congruence over time, psychologists attempt to recognize moments of incongruence and then engage in self-reflection to facilitate a return to greater authenticity.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^0fa034aa]. APA (2021). High credibility.

APA evidence-based psychological practice (EBPP) — Guideline 1 states that "Psychologists are mindful of the principles and importance of evidence-based practice". APA policy on EBPP "calls for the integration of three factors in the delivery of psychological care: the best available research evidence, the expertise of the clinician, and patient characteristics, culture, and preferences", and psychologists "seek to consult research evidence of relevance to their practice", which "includes but is not limited to the literature on human development and functioning; psychopathology; therapeutic treatments, relationships, and processes; preventive strategies; assessment; outcomes monitoring; ethical, legal, and cultural considerations; as well as professional practice guidelines and clinical practice guidelines". Clinical expertise is defined as "competence attained by psychologists through education, training, and experience that results in effective practice", EBPP "entails flexibly tailoring services to patient characteristics, culture, and preferences, which minimizes dropout and improves outcomes", and "Guideline 6 provides guidance for adapting treatment to these patient characteristics". The rationale emphasizes attention to "biases and heuristics that can adversely affect judgment" and notes that "regular consultation with colleagues and systematic collection of patient feedback can offer protection from the adverse effects of biases and heuristic shortcuts and contribute to improved patient outcomes".

Main Text

Introduction

An important and pervasive idea in the psychology of decision making and choice is that there is more than one class of possible strategy for acting. A key division is between forms of reflective control, which depend on the more or less explicit consideration of possible prospective future courses of actions and consequent outcomes, and forms of reflexive control a term we use in the restricted sense to describe how retrospective experience with good and bad outcomes sculpts present choice.

This apparent dichotomy is so intuitively obvious that it has been realized in many, slightly different, and only partly compatible, ways. Here, we single out one particular strand that has arguably been the most fecund in cognitive and theoretical neuroscience, providing a set of behaviorally rigorous criteria for separating out the two classes of control. In turn, this has led to a set of important studies into the partly distinct neural realizations of these classes and thence to an understanding of their computational and statistical characteristics. The latter provides a normative rationale for their coexistence as offering efficient solutions to the demands of complex and changing environments and has also underpinned the design and interpretation of a collection of targeted empirical studies.

### Testing the convergent validity, domain generality, and temporal stability of selected measures of people's tendency to explore [^2fe0d886]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Self-report scales

For the self-report measures we focused on two independent literatures: (i) social and personality psychology and (ii) judgment and decision making. Questions in each self-report scale were presented together although the scales were presented in random order. For each scale measuring the tendency to explore, participants were instructed to, "Rate the statements below for how accurately they reflect the way you generally feel and behave. Do not rate what you think you should do, or wish you do, or things you no longer do. Please be as honest as possible". Each scale is presented in full in the Supplemental Information.

Exploration scale

The self-reported exploration scale is one facet of the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory II. The exploration subscale has 5 items (e.g. "I actively seek as much information as I can in new situations"). These statements are rated on the following scale: 1 = very slightly or not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely. The average rating across these items provides a measure of the tendency to explore, with higher scores representing a greater tendency.

Maximization tendency scale

The maximization tendency scale is designed to measure people's tendency to pursue the best option available. The scale has 9 items (e.g. "I am uncomfortable making decisions before I know all of my options"). All items were rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree, to 5 = strongly agree; the other points were not labelled. The average rating across all items provides a measure of the tendency to explore, with higher scores representing a greater tendency.

Alternative search

The alternative search subscale of the maximization inventory is designed to measure the tendency to explore all possible options to increase the likelihood of finding the best one. The alternative search scale has 12 items (e.g. "I can't come to a decision unless I have carefully considered all of my options", and "I take time to read the whole menu when dining out"). We adapted items related to shopping to also include internet shopping. All items were rated from 1 = strongly disagree, to 6 = strongly agree; the other points were not labelled. The average rating across these items provides a measure of the tendency to explore, with higher scores representing a greater tendency.

DSM-IV-TR 300.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic criteria require either obsessions or compulsions, with obsessions involving intrusive, inappropriate thoughts, impulses, or images that are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems, attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize them, and recognition that they are a product of one's own mind; compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at preventing or reducing distress or a dreaded event but not realistically connected or clearly excessive. Additional criteria are that the person has recognized the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (note: this does not apply to children), symptoms cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with routine, functioning, or relationships, content is not restricted to another Axis I disorder, and the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition; specify With Poor Insight when for most of the time during the current episode the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.

Cooperativeness conforms to a Bayesian model

To model the behaviour in the game, including potential effects of social biases, co-player's behaviour and context on people's cooperativeness, we fitted eighteen different models (see Methods for further details). We compared different classes of models based on different principles. The first class of models is based on the assumption that players decide their behaviour purely based on the behaviour of their counterpart, by reciprocating either their last position, their last change in position, or a combination of the two. This class of models assumes players behave in a simple reactive fashion, "titxtat" kind of behaviour, irrespective of the social context (denoted "Simple models" in Fig. 3d). A second class of models goes further in assuming that what is reciprocated is not the position of the co-player in the last trial but rather the expected position (yet unobserved) in the current trial and that the amount of reciprocation is modulated by the social context. At their cores, they all assume that a player learns to anticipate the co-player's position in a fashion that is predicted quantitatively by a Bayesian learner carrying out the same task ("Bayesian models" in Fig. 3a–d). They also assume that this expectation is reciprocated in a titxtat fashion. However they differ in how this expectation is mapped onto a choice, allowing for different degrees of influence of the context, their counterpart's behaviour and the player's own bias. A third class of models assumes that participants were choosing what to do based not only on the other player behaviour but also on the outcome of each trial, with different assumptions on how winning a trial should change their behaviour in the next (becoming more or less cooperative). This class of models is effectively assuming that the player behaviour would be shaped by the reward collected ("Reward models" in Fig. 3d). We used formal Bayesian model comparison (see Methods) to identify the best-fitting model (Fig. 3d). The winning model is a Bayesian model and contained features that accounted for both people's biases towards cooperativeness, how the behaviour of the other player influenced subsequent choices and the influence of the social context.
